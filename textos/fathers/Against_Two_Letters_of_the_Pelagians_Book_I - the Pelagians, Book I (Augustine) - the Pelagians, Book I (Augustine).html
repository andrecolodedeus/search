<h1>Against Two Letters of the Pelagians (Book I)</h1>

<p>Augustine replies to a letter sent by Julian, as it was said, to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and first of all vindicates the catholic doctrine from his <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>; then discovers and confutes the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> sense of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> hidden in that profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which the author of the letter opposed to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; Introduction: Address to Boniface.</h2>

<p>I Had indeed <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> you by the praise of your renowned fame; and by very numerous and veracious messengers I had learned how full you were of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, most blessed and venerable Pope Boniface! But after my brother Alypius saw you even in bodily presence; and, having been received by you with all kindness and sincerity, held, at the bidding of affection, conversations with you; and living with you, and, although only for a short time, united with you in earnest affection, poured out to your mind both himself and me; and brought you back to me in his mind:&mdash; the more assured was your friendship, the greater became in me the conviction of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. For you, who mind not high things, however loftily you are placed, did not disdain to be a friend of the lowly and to return the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> bestowed upon you. For what else is friendship which has its name from no other source than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,  and is nowhere faithful but in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whom alone it can be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>? Whence, also, having received a greater assurance by means of that brother, through whom I have learned to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you more familiarly, I have ventured to write something to your blessedness concerning those things which at this juncture are claiming by a later stimulus the episcopal care, as far as we are able, to vigilance on behalf of the Lord's flock.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; Why Heretical Writings Must Be Answered.</h2>

<p>For the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, enemies of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which is given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord to small and great, although they are already shown more openly to need to be avoided by a manifest disapprobation, still do not cease by their writings to try the hearts of the less cautious and less learned. And these must certainly be answered, lest they should confirm themselves or their friends in that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; even if we were not afraid that they might deceive some one of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by their plausible discourse. But since they do not cease to growl at the entrances to the Lord's fold, and from every side to tear open approaches with a view to tear in pieces the sheep redeemed at such a price; and since the pastoral watchtower is common to all of us who discharge the office of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> (although you are prominent therein on a loftier height), I do what I can in respect of my small portion of the charge, as the Lord condescends by the aid of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to grant me power, to oppose to their pestilent and crafty writings, healing and defensive writings, so that the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> with which they are raging may either itself be cured, or may be prevented from hurting others.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; Why He Addresses His Book to Boniface.</h2>

<p>But these words which I am answering to their two letters&mdash;the one, to wit, which Julian is said to have sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that by its means, as I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, he might find or make as many allies as he could; and the other, which eighteen so-called <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, sharers in his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, dared to write to Thessalonica, not to any and every body, but to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that place itself, with a view of tempting him by their craftiness and bringing him over, if it could be done, to their views&mdash;these words which, as I said, I am writing in answer to those two letters of theirs in respect of that argument, I have determined to address especially to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, not so much for your learning as for your examination and, if perchance anything should displease you, for your correction. For my brother intimated to me that you yourself condescended to give those letters to him, which could not come into your hands except by the most watchful diligence of my brethren, your sons. And I thank your most sincere kindness to me that you have been unwilling that those letters of the enemies of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> should be hidden from me, seeing that in them you have found my name <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniously</a> as well as openly expressed. But I hope from my Lord God that not without the reward which is in heaven do those tear me with their scurrilous teeth to whom I oppose myself on behalf of the little ones, that they may not be left for destruction to the deceitful flatterer Pelagius, but may be presented for deliverance to the truthful Saviour Christ.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4 [II.]&mdash; The Calumny of Julian&mdash;That the Catholics Teach that Free Will is Taken Away by Adam's Sin.</h2>

<p>Let us now, therefore, reply to Julian's letter. <q>Those Manicheans say,</q> says he, <q>with whom now we do not communicate&mdash;that is, the whole of them with whom we differ&mdash;that by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first man, that is, of Adam, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> perished: and that no one has now the power of living well, but that all are constrained into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of their flesh.</q> He calls the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> Manicheans, after the manner of that Jovinian who a few years ago, as a new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, destroyed the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of the blessed Mary, and placed the marriage of the faithful on the same level with her sacred <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. And he did not object this to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on any other ground than that he wished them to seem to be either accusers or condemners of marriage.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; Free Choice Did Not Perish With Adam 's Sin. What Freedom Did Perish.</h2>

<p>But in defending <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> they hasten to confide rather in it for doing righteousness than in God's aid, and to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> every one in himself, and not in the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note152528"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:31</a></span> But who of us will say that by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first man <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> perished from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>? Through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> freedom indeed perished, but it was that freedom which was in Paradise, to have a full righteousness with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; and it is on this account that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> needs <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, since the Lord says, <q>If the Son shall make you free, then shall you be free indeed</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152529"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;8:36</a></span> &mdash; free of course to live well and righteously. For <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> in the sinner up to this extent did not perish&mdash;that by it all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, especially they who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with delight and with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; what they are pleased to do gives them pleasure. Whence also the apostle says, <q>When you were the servants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, you were free from righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152530"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;6:20</a></span> Behold, they are shown to have been by no means able to serve <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except by another freedom. They are not, then, free from righteousness except by the choice of the will, but they do not become free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> save by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Saviour. For which reason the admirable Teacher also distinguished these very words: <q>For when you were the servants,</q> says he, <q>of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, you were free from righteousness. What fruit did you have, then, in those things whereof you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now being freed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and become servants to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have your fruit unto <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and the end <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152531"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;6:20</a></span> He called them <q>free</q> from righteousness, not <q>freed;</q> but from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not <q>free,</q> lest they should attribute this to themselves, but most watchfully he preferred to say <q>freed,</q> referring this to that declaration of the Lord, <q>If the Son shall make you free, then shall you be free indeed.</q>  Since, then, the sons of men do not live well unless they are made the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why is it that this writer wishes to give the power of good living to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, when this power is not given save by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, as the gospel says: <q>And as many as received  Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152533"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;1:12</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6 [III.]&mdash; Grace is Not Given According to Merits.</h2>

<p>But lest perchance they say that they are aided to this&mdash;that they may <q>have power to become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> but that they may deserve to receive this power they have first <q>received Him</q> by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> with no assistance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (because this is the purpose of their endeavour to destroy <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that they may contend that it is given according to our deservings); lest perchance, then, they so divide that evangelical statement as to refer merit to that portion of it wherein it is said, <q>But as many as received Him,</q> and then say that in that which follows, <q>He gave them power to become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not given freely, but is repaid to this merit; if it is asked of them what is the meaning of <q>received Him,</q> will they say anything else than <q><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him</q>? And in order, therefore, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this also pertains to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, let them read what the apostle says: <q>And that you be in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which indeed is to them a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of perdition, but of your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, but also to suffer for His sake.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152534"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse28">Philippians&nbsp;1:28-29</a></span> Certainly he said that both were given. Let them read what he said also: <q>Peace be to the brethren, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152535"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse23">Ephesians&nbsp;6:23</a></span> Let them also read what the Lord Himself says: <q>No man can come to me, except the Father who has sent me shall draw him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152536"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;6:44</a></span> Where, lest any one should suppose that anything else is said in the words <q>come to me</q> than <q><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me,</q> a little after, when He was speaking of His body and blood, and many were offended at His discourse, He says, <q>The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and life; but there are some of you which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152537"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse64">John&nbsp;6:64</a></span> Then the Evangelist added, <q>For Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> from the beginning who they were that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and who should betray Him. And He said, Therefore I said unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given him of my Father.</q>  He repeated, to wit, the saying in which He had said, <q>No man can come unto me, except the Father who has sent me shall draw him.</q> And He declared that He said this for the sake of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> and unbelievers, explaining what He had said, <q>except the Father who has sent me shall draw him,</q> by repeating the very same thing in other words in that which He said, <q>except it were given him of my Father.</q> Because he is drawn to Christ to whom it is given to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore the power is given that they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him should become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since this very thing is given, that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. And unless this power be given from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, out of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> there can be none; because it will not be free for good if the deliverer have not made it free; but in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he has a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> in whom a deceiver, either secret or manifest, has grafted the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, or he himself has persuaded himself of it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; He Concludes that He Does Not Deprive the Wicked of Free Will.</h2>

<p>It is not, therefore, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as some affirm that we say, and as that correspondent of yours ventures moreover to write, that <q>all are forced into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> as if they were unwilling, <q>by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of their flesh;</q> but if they are already of the age to use the choice of their own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, they are both retained in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by their own will, and by their own will are hurried along from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For even he who persuades and deceives does not act in them, except that they may commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by their will, either by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or by delight in iniquity, or by both <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>&mdash;as well of blindness as of weakness. But this will, which is free in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things because it takes pleasure in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is not free in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, for the reason that it has not been made free. Nor can a man will any good thing unless he is aided by Him who cannot will <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash;that is, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord. For <q>everything which is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152539"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;14:23</a></span> And thus the good will which withdraws itself from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is faithful, because the just lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note152540"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse4">Habakkuk&nbsp;2:4</a></span> And it pertains to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And no man can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ&mdash; that is, come to Him&mdash; unless it be given to him. <span class="stiki" id="note152541"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;1:17</a></span> No man, therefore, can have a righteous will, unless, with no foregoing merits, he has received the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that is, the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from above.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8 [IV.]&mdash; The Pelagians Demolish Free Will.</h2>

<p>These <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> people will not have this; and yet they do not maintain <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> by purifying it, but demolish it by exaggerating it. For they are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with us who say these things, for no other reason than that they disdain to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord. Yet Pelagius feared the episcopal judgment of Palestine; and when it was objected to him that he said that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is given according to our merits, he denied that he said so, and condemned those who said this with an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.  And yet nothing else is found to be defended in the books which he afterwards wrote, thinking that he had made a fraud upon the men who were his judges, by lying or by hiding his meaning, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how, in ambiguous words. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9 [V.]&mdash; Another Calumny of Julian&mdash;That <q>It is Said that Marriage is Not Appointed by God.</q></h2>

<p>But now let us see what follows. <q>They say also,</q> he says, <q>that those marriages which are now celebrated were not appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is to be read in Augustine's book,  against which I replied in four books. And the words of this Augustine our enemies have taken up by way of hostility to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> To these most <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> words I see that a brief answer must be made, because he repeats them afterwards when he wishes to insinuate what such men as they would say, as if against my words. On that point, with God's assistance, I must contend with him as far as the matter shall seem to demand. Now, therefore, I reply that marriage was ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> both then, when it was said, <q>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152545"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;2:24</a></span> and now, wherefore it is written, <q>A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is joined to a man by the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152546"><a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse24">Proverbs&nbsp;19:24</a></span> For nothing else is even now done than that a man cleave to his wife, and they become two in one flesh. Because concerning that very marriage which is now contracted, the Lord was consulted by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> whether it was lawful for any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to put away a wife. And to the testimony of the law on the occasion mentioned, He added, <q>What, therefore, God has joined together, let not man put asunder.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> also applied this <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the law when he admonished husbands that their wives should be loved by them. <span class="stiki" id="note152548"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians&nbsp;5:25</a></span> Away, then, with the notion that in my book that man should read anything opposed to these divine testimonies! But either by not understanding, or rather by <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniating</a>, he seeks to twist what he reads into another meaning. But I wrote my book, against which he mentions that he replied in four books, after the condemnation of Pelagius and C&oelig;lestius. And this, I have thought, must be said, because that man avers that my words had been taken up by his enemies in hostility to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, lest any one should think that these new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were condemned as enemies of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ on account of this book of mine. But in that book is found the defence rather than the censure of marriage.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10&mdash; The Third Calumny&mdash;The Assertion that Conjugal Intercourse is Condemned.</h2>

<p><q>They say also,</q> says he, <q>that sexual impulse and the intercourse of married people were devised by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and that therefore those who are born innocent are guilty, and that it is the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they are born of this diabolical intercourse. And this, without any ambiguity, is Manicheism.</q> Nay, as I say that marriage was appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the sake of the ordinance of the begetting of children, so I say that the propagation of children to be begotten could not have taken place without sexual impulse, and without intercourse of husband and wife, even in Paradise, if children were begotten there. But whether such impulse and intercourse would have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, as is now the case with shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, if no one had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, here is the question concerning which I shall argue hereafter, if God will.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11 [VI.]&mdash; The Purpose of the Pelagians in Praising the Innocence of Conjugal Intercourse.</h2>

<p>Yet what it is they wish, what they purpose, to what result they are striving to bring the matter, the words that are added by that writer declare, when he asserts that I say, <q>that therefore they who are born innocent are guilty, and that it is the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they are born of this diabolical intercourse.</q> Since, therefore, I neither say that this intercourse of husband and wife is diabolical, especially in the case of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, which is effected for the sake of generating children who are afterwards to be regenerated; nor that any men are made by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but, in so far as they are men, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and nevertheless that even of believing husband and wife are born guilty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (as if a wild olive were produced from an olive),  on account of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and on this account they are under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> unless they are born again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the author of the fault, not of the nature: what, on the other hand, are they labouring to bring about who say that infants inherit no original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and therefore are not under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, except that that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in infants may be made of no effect, by which He has plucked us out, as the apostle says, from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note152550"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> [VII.] When, indeed, they deny that infants are in the power of darkness even before the help of the Lord the deliverer, they are in such wise praising in them the Creator's work as to destroy the mercy of the Redeemer. And because I confess this both in grown-up people and in infants, he says that this is without any ambiguity Manicheism, although it is the most ancient catholic dogma by which the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> dogma of these men is overturned.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; The Fourth Calumny&mdash;That the Saints of the Old Testament are Said to Be Not Free from Sins.</h2>

<p><q>They say,</q> says he, <q>that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were not without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash;that is that they were not free from crimes even by amendment, but they were seized by death in their guilt.</q> Nay, I say that either before the law, or in the time of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, they were freed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash;not by their own power, because <q>cursed is every one that has put his hope in man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152551"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:5</a></span> and without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> those are under this curse whom also the sacred Psalm notifies, <q>who trust in their own strength;</q>  nor by the old covenant which genders to bondage, <span class="stiki" id="note152553"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse24">Galatians&nbsp;4:24</a></span> although it was divinely given by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of a sure dispensation; nor by that law itself, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just and good as it was, where it is written, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152554"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse7">Exodus&nbsp;20:7</a></span> since it was not given as being able to give life, but it was added for the sake of transgression until the seed should come to whom the promise was made; but I say that they were freed by the blood of the Redeemer Himself, who is the one Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the man Christ Jesus. <span class="stiki" id="note152555"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> But those enemies of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is given to small and great through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, say that the men of God of old were of a perfect righteousness, lest they should be supposed to have needed the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, the passion, and resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by belief in whom they were saved.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13 [VIII.]&mdash; The Fifth Calumny&mdash;That It is Said that Paul and the Rest of the Apostles Were Polluted by Lust.</h2>

<p>He says, <q>They say that even the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, even all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, were always polluted by immoderate <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.</q> What man, however profane he may be, would dare to say this? But doubtless this man thus misrepresents because they contend that what the apostle said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing, for to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> I find not,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152556"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;7:18</a></span> and other such things, he said not of himself, but that he introduced the person of somebody else, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not who, who was suffering these things. Wherefore that passage in his epistle must be carefully considered and investigated, that their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> may not lurk in any obscurity of his. Although, therefore, the apostle is here arguing broadly, and with great and lasting conflict maintaining <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> against those who were boasting in the law, yet we do come upon a few matters which pertain to the matter in hand. On which subject he says: <q>Because by the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight. For by the law is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, even the righteousness of God by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> unto all them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For there is no difference. For all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and come short of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being justified freely by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through the redemption that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152557"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;3:20</a></span> And again: <q>Where is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No; but by the law of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without the works of the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152558"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse27">Romans&nbsp;3:27</a></span> And again: <q>For the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> or to his seed through the law, but by the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For if they which are of the law be heirs, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is made void, and the promise made of none effect. Because the law works <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, for where no law is, there is no transgression.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152559"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;4:13</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And in another place: <q>Moreover, the law entered that the offense might abound. But where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> did much more abound.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152560"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span> In still another place: <q>For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law, but under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152561"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;6:14</a></span> And again in another place: <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, brethren (for I speak to them that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the law), that the law has dominion over a man so long as he lives? For the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> which is under a husband is joined to her husband by the law so long as he lives; but if her husband be dead, she is freed from the law of her husband.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152562"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;7:1-2</a></span> And a little after: <q>Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law by the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that you should belong to another, who has risen from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For when we were in the flesh the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death, but now we are delivered from the law of death in which we were held, so that we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</q>  With these and such like testimonies that teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> showed with sufficient evidence that the law could not take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but rather increased it, and that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> takes it away; since the law <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to command, to which command weakness gives way, while <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to assist, whereby <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is infused.  And lest any one, on account of these testimonies, should reproach the law, and contend that it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the apostle, seeing what might occur to those who ill understand it, himself proposed to himself the same question. <q>What shall we say, then?</q> said he. <q>Is the law <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Far from it. But I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except by the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152565"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;7:7</a></span> He had already said before, <q>For by the law is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> It is not, therefore, the taking away, but the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; That the Apostle is Speaking in His Own Person and that of Others Who Are Under Grace, Not Still Under Law.</h2>

<p>And from this point he now begins&mdash; and, it was on account of this that I undertook the consideration of these things&mdash; to introduce his own person, and to speak as if about himself; where the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> will not have it that the apostle himself is to be understood, but say that he has transfigured another person into himself&mdash;that is, a man placed still under the law, not yet freed by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And here, indeed, they ought at least to concede that <q>in the law no one is justified,</q> as the same apostle says elsewhere; but that the law avails for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and for the transgression of the law itself, so that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and increased, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be sought for through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But they do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that those things should be understood concerning the apostle which he might also say concerning his past, but they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> those things which follow. For here he says: <q>I had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> if the law had not said, You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>. But the occasion being taken, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> wrought in me by the commandment all manner of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For without the law <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was dead. But I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> revived, and I died, and the commandment which was for life was found for me to be death. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. Therefore the law indeed is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and the commandment <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, just, and good. Was, then, that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> made death unto me? By no means. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that it might appear <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, worked death to me by that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that the sinner or the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might become by the commandment excessive.</q> All these things, as I have said, the apostle can seem to have commemorated from his past life: so that from what he says, <q>For I was alive without the law once,</q> he may have wished his first age from infancy to be understood, before the years of reason; but in that he added, <q>But when the commandment came, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> revived, but I died,</q> he would fain show himself able to receive the commandment, but not to do it, and therefore a transgressor of the law.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15 [IX.]&mdash; He Sins in Will Who is Only Deterred from Sinning by Fear.</h2>

<p>Nor let us be disturbed by what he wrote to the Philippians: <q>Touching the righteousness which is in the law, one who is without blame.</q> For he could be within in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> affections a transgressor of the law, and yet fulfil the open works of the law, either by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of men or of God Himself; but by terror of punishment, not by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and delight in righteousness. For it is one thing to do good with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of doing good, and another thing to be so inclined by the will to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that one would actually do it if it could be allowed without punishment. For thus assuredly he is sinning within in his will itself, who abstains from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not by will but by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. And <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> himself to have been such in these his internal affections, before the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which is through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, the apostle elsewhere confesses this very plainly. For writing to the Ephesians, he says: <q>And you, though you were dead in your trespasses and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, wherein sometime you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of that spirit that now works in the children of disobedience, in whom also we all at one time had our conversation in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of our flesh, doing the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of our flesh and our affections, and were by nature the children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, even as others also: but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is rich in mercy, for His great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith He loved us even when we were dead in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, quickened us together with Christ, by whose <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we are saved.</q> Again to Titus he says: <q>For we ourselves also were sometime foolish and unbelieving, erring, serving various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and pleasures, living in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, hateful, and holding one another in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.</q> Such was Saul when he says that he was, touching the righteousness which is in the law, without reproach. For that he had not pressed on in the law, and changed his character so as to be without reproach after this hateful life, he plainly shows in what follows, when he says that he was not changed from these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> except by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Saviour. For adding also this very thing, here as well as to the Ephesians, he says: <q>But when the kindness and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God our Saviour shone forth, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and of the renewal of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whom He shed on us most abundantly, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Saviour, that being justified by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we should be made heirs according to the hope of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; How Sin Died, and How It Revived.</h2>

<p>And what he says in that passage of the Epistle to the Romans, <q>Sin, that it might appear <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wrought death to me by that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152566"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;7:13</a></span> agrees with the former passages where he said, <q>But I had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but by the law, for I had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> unless the law had said, You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152567"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;7:7</a></span> And previously, <q>By the law is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> for he said this also here, <q>that it might appear <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> that we might not understand what he had said, <q>For without law <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was dead,</q> except in the sense as if it were not, <q>it lies hidden, it does not appear, it is completely ignored, as if it were buried in I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what darkness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</q> And in that he says, <q>And I was alive once without the law,</q> what does he say except, I seemed to myself to live? And with respect to what he added, <q>But when the commandment came, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> revived,</q> what else is it but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shone forth, became apparent? Nor yet does he say lived, but revived. For it had lived formerly in Paradise, where it sufficiently appeared, admitted in opposition to the command given; but when it is inherited by children coming into the world, it lies concealed, as if it were dead, until its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, resisting righteousness, is felt by its prohibition, when one thing is commanded and approved, another thing delights and rules: then, in some measure <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> revives in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the man that is born, although it had lived already for some time in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the man as at first made.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17 [X.]&mdash; <q>The Law is Spiritual, But I Am Carnal,</q> To Be Understood of Paul.</h2>

<p>But it is not so clear how what follows can be understood concerning <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. <q>For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> says he, <q>that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152568"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;7:14</a></span> He does not say, <q>I was,</q> but, <q>I am.</q> Was, then, the apostle, when he wrote this, carnal? Or does he say this with respect to his body? For he was still in the body of this death, not yet made what he speaks of elsewhere: <q>It is sown a natural body, it shall be raised a spiritual body.</q>  For then, of the whole of himself, that is, of both parts of which he consists, he shall be a spiritual man, when even the body shall be spiritual. For it is not absurd that in that life even the flesh should be spiritual, if in this life in those who still mind earthly things even the spirit itself may be carnal. Thus, then, he said, <q>But I am carnal,</q> because the apostle had not yet a spiritual body, as he might say, <q>But I am mortal,</q> which assuredly he could not be understood to have said except in respect of his body, which had not yet been clothed with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Moreover, in reference to what he added, <q>sold under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152570"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;7:14</a></span> lest any one think that he was not yet redeemed by the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, this also may be understood in respect of that which he says: <q>And we ourselves, having the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152571"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;8:23</a></span> For if in this respect he says that he was sold under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that as yet his body has not been redeemed from corruption; or that he was sold once in the first transgression of the commandment so as to have a corruptible body which drags down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note152572"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> what hinders the apostle here from being understood to say about himself that which he says in such wise that it may be understood also of himself, even if in his person he wishes not himself alone, but all, to be received who had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> themselves as struggling, without consent, in spiritual delight with the affection of the flesh?</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; How the Apostle Said that He Did the Evil that He Would Not.</h2>

<p>Or by chance do we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what follows, <q>For that which I do I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, for what I will I do not, but what I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> that I do,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152573"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;7:15</a></span> lest perhaps from these words some one should suspect that the apostle is consenting to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works of the concupiscence of the flesh? But we must consider what he adds: <q>But if I do that which I will not, I consent to the law that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> For he says that he rather consents to the law than to the concupiscence of the flesh. For this he calls by the name of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore he said that he acted and laboured not with the desire of consenting and fulfilling, but from the impulse of lusting itself. Hence, then, he says, <q>I consent to the law that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> I consent because I do not will what it does not will. Afterwards he says, <q>Now, then, it is no more I that do it, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which dwells in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152574"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;7:17</a></span> What does he mean by <q>now then,</q> but, now at length, under the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which has delivered the delight of my will from the consent of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>? For, <q>it is not I that do it,</q> cannot be better understood than that he does not consent to set forth his members as instruments of unrighteousness unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For if he <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and consents and acts, how can he be said not to do the thing himself, even although he may grieve that he does it, and deeply groan at being overcome?</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; What It is to Accomplish What is Good.</h2>

<p>And now does not what follows most plainly show whence he spoke? <q>For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152575"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;7:18</a></span> For if he had not explained what he said by the addition of <q>that is, in my flesh,</q> it might, perchance, be otherwise understood, when he said, <q>in me.</q> And therefore he repeats and urges the same thing in another form: <q>For to will is present with me, but to perform that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152576"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;7:18</a></span> For this is to perform that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that a man should not even <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For the good is incomplete when one <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, even although a man does not consent to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. <q>For the good that I would,</q> says he, <q>I do not; but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that dwells in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152577"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;7:20</a></span> This he repeated impressively, and as it were to stir up the most <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> from slumber: <q>I find then that the law,</q> said he, <q>is for me wishing to do good, since <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is present with me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152578"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;7:21</a></span> The law, then, is for one who would do good, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is present from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, though he does not consent to this who says, <q>It is no longer I that do it.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; In Me, that Is, in My Flesh.</h2>

<p>And he declares both more plainly in what follows: <q>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man; but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and bringing me into captivity to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is in my members.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152579"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;7:21-22</a></span> But in that he said, <q>bringing me into captivity,</q> he can feel emotion without consenting to it. Whence, because of those three things, two, to wit, of which we have already argued, in that he says, <q>But I am carnal,</q> and <q>Sold under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> and this third, <q>Bringing me into captivity in the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is in my members,</q> the apostle seems to be describing a man who is still living under the law, and is not yet under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But as I have expounded the former two sayings in respect of the still corruptible flesh, so also this latter may be understood as if he had said, <q>bringing me into captivity,</q> in the flesh, not in the mind; in emotion, not in consent; and therefore <q>bringing me into captivity,</q> because even in the flesh there is not an alien nature, but our own. As, therefore, he himself expounded what he had said, <q>For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing,</q> so also now out of the exposition of that we ought to learn the meaning of this passage, as if he had said, <q>Bringing <em>me</em> into captivity,</q> that is, <q>my flesh,</q> <q>to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is in my members.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; No Condemnation in Christ Jesus.</h2>

<p>Then he adds the reason why he said all these things: <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord!</q> And thence he concludes: <q>Therefore I myself with the mind serve the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but with the flesh the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152580"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24-25</a></span> To wit, with the flesh, the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by lusting; but with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by not consenting to that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. <q>For there is now no condemnation to those who are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152581"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;8:1</a></span> For he is not condemned who does not consent to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh. <q>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made you free from the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death,</q> so that, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh may not appropriate to itself your consent. And what follows more and more demonstrates the same meaning. But moderation must be used.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; Why the Passage Referred to Must Be Understood of a Man Established Under Grace.</h2>

<p>And it had once appeared to me also that the apostle was in this argument of his describing a man under the law.  But afterwards I was constrained to give up the idea by those words where he says, <q>Now, then, it is no more I that do it.</q> For to this belongs what he says subsequently also: <q>There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them that are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> And because I do not see how a man under the law should say, <q>I delight in the law of God after the inward man;</q> since this very delight in good, by which, moreover, he does not consent to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of penalty, but from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of righteousness (for this is meant by <q>delighting</q>), can only be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23 [XI.]&mdash; What It is to Be Delivered from the Body of This Death.</h2>

<p>For when he says also, <q>Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152583"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24</a></span> who can deny that when the apostle said this he was still in the body of this death? And certainly the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are not delivered from this, to whom the same bodies are returned for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> torment. Therefore, to be delivered from the body of this death is to be healed of all the weakness of fleshly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and to receive the body, not for penalty, but for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. With this passage also those words are sufficiently in harmony: <q>Ourselves also, which have the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption, of our body.</q> For surely we groan with that groaning wherein we say, <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</q> That also where he says, <q>For what I do, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not;</q> what else is it than: <q>I will not, I do not approve, I do not consent, I do not do</q>? Otherwise it is contrary  to what he said above, <q>By the law is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> and, <q>I had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but by the law,</q> and, <q>Sin, that it might appear <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, worked death in me by that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> For how did he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, of which he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, by the law? How does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> appear? Therefore it is said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not,</q> for <q>I do not,</q> because I myself commit it with no consent of mine; in the same way in which the Lord will say to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you not,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152584"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;7:23</a></span> although, beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, nothing can be hid from Him; and as it is said, <q>Him who had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152585"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:21</a></span> which means who had not done <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for He had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what He condemned.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; He Concludes that the Apostle Spoke in His Own Person, and that of Those Who are Under Grace.</h2>

<p>On the careful consideration of these things, and things of the same kind in the context of that <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> Scripture, the apostle is rightly understood to have signified not, indeed, himself alone in his own person, but others also established under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and with him not yet established in that perfect peace in which death shall be swallowed up in victory. <span class="stiki" id="note152586"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse54">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:54</a></span> And concerning this he afterwards says, <q>But if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. If, then, the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He that raised up Jesus from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwells in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152587"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;8:10-11</a></span> Therefore, after our mortal bodies have been quickened, not only will there be no consent to sinning, but even the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh itself, to which there is no consent, will not remain. And not to have this resistance to the spirit in the mortal flesh, was possible only to that man who came not by the flesh to men. And that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, because they were men, and carried about in the mortality of this life a body which is corrupted and weighs down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note152588"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> were, therefore, <q>always polluted with excessive <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>,</q> as that man injuriously affirms, be it far from me to say. But I do say that although they were free from consent to depraved <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, they nevertheless groaned concerning the concupiscence of the flesh, which they bridled by restraint with such humility and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, that they desired rather not to have it than to subdue it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25 [XII.]&mdash; The Sixth Calumny&mdash;That Augustine Asserts that Even Christ Was Not Free from Sins.</h2>

<p>In like manner as to what he added, that I say,  <q>that Christ even was not free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but that, from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the flesh, He spoke <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, and was stained with other faults,</q> he should see from whom he heard these things, or in whose letters he read them; for that, indeed, he perchance did not understand them, and turned them by the deceitfulness of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> into <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> meanings.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26 [XIII.]&mdash; The Seventh Calumny&mdash;That Augustine Asserts that in Baptism All Sins are Not Remitted.</h2>

<p><q>They also say,</q> says he, <q>that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does not give complete remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, nor take away crimes, but that it shaves them off, so that the roots of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are retained in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> flesh.</q> Who but an unbeliever can affirm this against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>? I say, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> gives remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and takes away guilt, and does not shave them off; and <q>that the roots of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are</q> not <q>retained in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> flesh, as if of shaved hair on the head, whence the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may grow to be cut down again.</q> For it was I that found out that similitude, too, for them to use for the purposes of their <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, as if I thought and said this.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; In What Sense Lust is Called Sin in the Regenerate.</h2>

<p>But concerning that concupiscence of the flesh of which they speak, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they are deceived, or that they deceive; for with this even he that is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> must struggle with a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, however carefully he presses forward, and is led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. But although this is called <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is certainly so called not because it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but because it is made by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as a writing is said to be some one's <q>hand</q> because the hand has written it. But they are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are unlawfully done, spoken, thought, according to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, or to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>&mdash; things which, once done, keep their doers guilty if they are not forgiven. And this very concupiscence of the flesh is in such wise put away in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that although it is inherited by all that are born, it in no respect hurts those that are born anew. And yet from these, if they carnally beget children, it is again derived; and again it will be hurtful to those that are born, unless by the same form it is remitted to them as born again, and remains in them in no way hindering the future life, because its guilt, derived by generation, has been put away by regeneration; and thus it is now no more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is called so, whether because it became what it is by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or because it is stirred by the delight of sinning, although by the conquest of the delight of righteousness consent is not given to it. Nor is it on account of this, the guilt of which has already been taken away in the laver of regeneration, that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> say in their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152590"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> but on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are committed, whether in consentings to it, when what is right is overcome by that which pleases, or when by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is accepted as if it were good. And they are committed, whether by acting, or by speaking, or&mdash; and this is the easiest and the quickest&mdash; by thinking. From all which things what believer ever will boast that he has his heart pure? Or who will boast that he is pure from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note152591"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse9">Proverbs&nbsp;20:9</a></span> Certainly that which follows in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is said on account of concupiscence: <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, but deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <q>For every one,</q> as it is written, <q>is tempted when he is drawn away of his own concupiscence, and enticed; then, when concupiscence has conceived, it brings forth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152592"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse14">James&nbsp;1:14</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 28 [XIV.]&mdash; Many Without Crime, None Without Sin.</h2>

<p>All these products of concupiscence, and the old guilt of concupiscence itself, are put away by the washing of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And whatever that concupiscence now brings forth, if they are not those products which are called not only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but even crimes, are purified by that method of daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> when we say, <q>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive,</q> and by the sincerity of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>. For no one is so foolish as to say that that precept of our Lord does not refer to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> people: <q>Forgive and it shall be forgiven you, give and it shall be given you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152593"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse37">Luke&nbsp;6:37-38</a></span> But none could rightly be ordained a minister in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> if the apostle had said, <q>If any is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> where he says, <q>If any is without crime;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152594"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse6">Titus&nbsp;1:6</a></span> or if he had said, <q>Having no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> where he says, <q>Having no crime.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152595"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:10</a></span> Because many <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are without crime, but I should say that no one in this life is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash;however much the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> are inflated, and burst asunder in <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> against me because I say this: not because there remains anything of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is not remitted in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; but because by us who remain in the weakness of this life such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not cease daily to be committed, as are daily remitted to those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and work in mercy. This is the soundness of the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> everywhere sows&mdash;not the vanity and presumption of spirit of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> pravity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29 [XV.]&mdash; Julian Opposes the Faith of His Friends to the Opinions of Catholic Believers. First of All, of Free Will.</h2>

<p>Now therefore let us see, for the rest, in what way&mdash; after thinking that he might <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniously</a> object against me what I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and feign what I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>&mdash; he himself professes his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or that of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. <q>In opposition to these things,</q> he says, <q>we daily argue, and we are unwilling to yield our consent to transgressors, because we say that <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is in all by nature, and could not perish by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Adam; which assertion is confirmed by the authority of all Scriptures.</q> If in any degree it is necessary to say this, you should not say it against the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;you should not give your consent to transgressors, but you should correct your opinion. But about this, as much as I could, and as far as it seemed to be sufficient, I have argued above.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30.&mdash; Secondly, of Marriage.</h2>

<p><q>We say,</q> says he, <q>that that marriage which is now celebrated throughout the earth was ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that married people are not guilty, but that fornicators and adulterers are to be condemned.</q> This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and catholic doctrine; but what you want to gather from this, to wit, that from the intercourse of male and female those who are born derive no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be put away by the laver of regeneration&mdash;this is false and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31.&mdash; Thirdly, of Conjugal Intercourse.</h2>

<p><q>We say,</q> says he, <q>that the sexual impulse&mdash; that is, that the virility itself, without which there can be no intercourse&mdash; is ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> To this I reply that the sexual impulse, and, to make use of his word, virility, without which there can be no intercourse, was so appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that there was in it nothing to be ashamed of. For it was not fit that His creature should blush at the work of his Creator; but by a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment the disobedience of the members was the retribution to the disobedience of the first man, for which disobedience they blushed when they covered with fig-leaves those shameful parts which previously were not shameful.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32 [XVI.]&mdash; The Aprons Which Adam and Eve Wore.</h2>

<p>For they did not use for themselves tunics to cover their whole bodies after their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but aprons, <span class="stiki" id="note152596"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;3:7</a></span> which some of the less careful of our translators have translated as <q>coverings.</q> And this indeed is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but <q>covering</q> is a general name, by which may be understood every kind of clothing and veil. And ambiguity ought to be avoided, so that, as the Greek called them <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03B6;&#x1F7D;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>, by which only the shameful parts of the body are covered, so also the Latin should either use the Greek word itself, because now custom has come to use it instead of the Latin, or, as some do, use the word aprons,  or, as others have better named them, wrestling aprons.  Because this name is taken from that ancient Roman custom whereby the youth covered their shameful parts when they were exercised naked in the field; whence even at this day they are called <em>campestrati</em>,  since they cover those members with the girdle. Although, if those members by which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was committed were to be covered after the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, men ought not indeed to have been clothed in tunics, but to have covered their hand and mouth, because they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by taking and eating. What, then, is the meaning, when the prohibited food was taken, and the transgression of the precept had been committed, of the look turned towards those members? What unknown novelty is felt there, and compels itself to be noticed? And this is signified by the opening of the eyes. For their eyes were not closed, either when <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> gave names to the cattle and birds, or when Eve saw the trees to be beautiful and good; but they were made open&mdash; that is, attentive&mdash; to consider; as it is written of Agar, the handmaid of Sarah, that she opened her eyes and saw a well, <span class="stiki" id="note152600"><a href="../bible/gen021.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;21:19</a></span> although she certainly had not had them closed before. As, therefore, they were so suddenly ashamed of their nakedness, which they were daily in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of looking upon and were not confused, that they could now no longer bear those members naked, but immediately took care to cover them; did not they&mdash; he in the open, she in the hidden impulse&mdash; perceive those members to be disobedient to the choice of their will, which certainly they ought to have ruled like the rest by their <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> command? And this they deservedly suffered, because they themselves also were not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to their Lord. Therefore they blushed that they in such wise had not manifested service to their Creator, that they should deserve to lose dominion over those members by which children were to be procreated.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33.&mdash; The Shame of Nakedness.</h2>

<p>This kind of shame&mdash; this necessity of blushing&mdash; is certainly born with every man, and in some measure is commanded by the very <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature; so that, in this matter, even <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> married people are ashamed. Nor can any one go to such an extreme of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and disgrace, as, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> God to be the author of nature and the ordainer of marriage, to have intercourse even with his wife in any one's sight, or not to blush at those impulses and seek secrecy, where he can shun the sight not only of strangers, but even of all his own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>. Therefore let <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be permitted to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that happens to it by its own fault, lest it should be compelled either not to blush at its own impulses, which is most shameless, or else to blush at the work of its Creator, which is most ungrateful. Of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> marriage makes good use for the sake of the benefit of the begetting of children. But to consent to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for the sake of carnal pleasure alone is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although it may be conceded to married people with permission.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34 [XVII.]&mdash; Whether There Could Be Sensual Appetite in Paradise Before the Fall.</h2>

<p>But, while maintaining, you <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, the honourableness and fruitfulness of marriage, determine, if nobody had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, what you would wish to consider the life of those people in Paradise, and choose one of these four things. For beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, either as often as ever they pleased they would have had intercourse; or they would bridle <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> when intercourse was not necessary; or <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> would arise at the summons of will, just at the time when chaste <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> would have perceived beforehand that intercourse was necessary; or, with no <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> existing at all, as every other member served for its own work, so for its own work the organs of generation also would <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the commands of those that willed, without any difficulty. Of these four suppositions, choose which you please; but I think you will reject the two former, in which <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is either <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> or resisted. For the first one would not be in accordance with so great a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and the second not in harmony with so great a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For be the idea far from us, that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of so great a blessedness as that should either be most basely enslaved by always following a preceding <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, or, by resisting it, should not enjoy the most abounding peace. Away, I say, with the thought that that mind should either be gratified by consenting to satisfy the concupiscence of the flesh, arising not opportunely for the sake of procreation, but with unregulated excitement, or that that quiet should find it necessary to restrain it by refusing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35.&mdash; Desire in Paradise Was Either None at All, or It Was Obedient to the Impulse of the Will.</h2>

<p>But whichever you choose of the two other alternatives, there is no necessity for striving against you with any disputation. For even if you should refuse to elect the fourth, in which there is the highest tranquillity of all the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> members without any <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, since already the urgency of your arguments has made you hostile to it; that will doubtless please you which I have put in the third place, that that carnal concupiscence, whose impulse attains to the final pleasure which much delights you, should never arise in Paradise except at the bidding of the will when it would be necessary for procreation. If it is agreeable to you to arrange this in Paradise, and if, by means of such a concupiscence of the flesh which should neither anticipate, nor impede, nor exceed the bidding of the will, it appears to you that children could have been begotten, I have no objection. For, as far as I am concerned in this matter, it is enough for me that such a concupiscence of the flesh is not now among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as you concede there might have been in that place of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For what it now is, the sense of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> certainly confesses, although with modesty; because it both solicits with excessive and importunate uneasiness the chaste, even when they are unwilling and are checking it by moderation, and frequently withdraws itself from the willing and inflicts itself on the unwilling; so that, by its disobedience, it testifies that it is nothing else than the punishment of that first disobedience. Whence, reasonably, both then the first men when they covered their nakedness, and now whoever considers himself to be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, every no less modest than immodest person is confounded at it&mdash; far be it from us to say by the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but&mdash; by the penalty of the first and ancient <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. You, however, not for the sake of religious reasoning, but for excited contention&mdash;not on behalf of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> modesty, but for your own <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, that even the concupiscence of the flesh itself should not be thought to be currupted, and original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be derived from it&mdash;are endeavouring by your argument to recall it absolutely, such as it now is, into Paradise; and to contend that that concupiscence could have been there which would either always be followed by a disgraceful consent, or would sometimes be restrained by a pitiable refusal. I, however, do not greatly care what it delights you to think of it. Still, whatever of men is born by its means, if he is not born again, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he is damned; and he must be under the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, if he is not delivered thence by Christ.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36 [XVIII.]&mdash; Julian's Fourth Objection, that Man is God's Work, and is Not Constrained to Evil or Good by His Power.</h2>

<p><q>We maintain,</q> says he, <q>that men are the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that no one is forced unwillingly by His power either into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or good, but that man does either good or ill of his own will; but that in a good work he is always assisted by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, while in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he is incited by the suggestions of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> To this I answer, that men, in so far as they are men, are the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but in so far as they are sinners, they are under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, unless they are plucked from thence by Him who became the Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for no other reason than because He could not be a sinner from men. And that no one is forced by God's power unwillingly either into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or good, but that when God forsakes a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he deservedly goes to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that when God assists, without deserving he is converted to good. For a man is not good if he is unwilling, but by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God he is even assisted to the point of being willing; because it is not vainly written, <q>For it is God that works in you, both to will and to do for His good pleasure,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152601"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> and, <q>The will is prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152602"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse35">Proverbs&nbsp;8:35</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 37 [XIX.]&mdash; The Beginning of a Good Will is the Gift of Grace.</h2>

<p>But you think that a man is so aided by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a good work, that in stirring up his will to that very good work you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does nothing; for this your own words sufficiently declare. For why have you not said that a man is incited by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to a good work, as you have said that he is incited to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by the suggestions of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but have said that in a good work he is always aided by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>?&mdash; as if by his own will, and without any <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he undertook a good work, and were then divinely assisted in the work itself, for the sake, that is to say, of the merits of his good will; so that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is rendered as due&mdash;not given as not due&mdash;and thus <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is made no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note152603"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;11:6</a></span> But this is what, in the Palestinian judgment, Pelagius with a deceitful heart condemned&mdash;that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, is given according to our merits. Tell me, I beseech you, what good, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, while he was as yet Saul, willed, and not rather great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, when breathing out slaughter he went, in horrible darkness of mind and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, to lay waste the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note152604"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;9:1</a></span> For what merits of a good will did God convert him by a marvellous and sudden calling from those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things? What shall I say, when he himself cries, <q>Not by works of righteousness that we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152605"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus&nbsp;3:5</a></span> What is that which I have already mentioned  as having been said by the Lord, <q>No one can come to me,</q>&mdash; which is understood as <q><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me,</q>&mdash; unless it were given him of my Father? <span class="stiki" id="note152607"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse66">John&nbsp;6:66</a></span> Whether is this given to him who is already willing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, for the sake of the merits of a good will? Or rather is the will itself, as in the case of Saul, stirred up from above, that he may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, even although he is so averse from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as even to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>? For how has the Lord commanded us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for those who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> us? Do we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> thus that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God may be recompensed them for the sake of their good will, and not rather that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will itself may be changed into a good one? Just as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that at that time the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> whom he was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> did not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for Saul in vain, that his will might be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he was destroying. And indeed that his conversion was effected from above, appeared even by a manifest <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. But how many enemies of Christ are at the present day suddenly drawn by God's secret <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to Christ! And if I had not set down this word from the gospel, what things would that man have said in this behalf concerning me, since even now he is stirring, not against me, but against Him who cries, <q>No man can come to me, except the Father who has sent me draw him</q>! <span class="stiki" id="note152608"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;6:44</a></span> For He does not say, <q>except He lead him,</q> so that we can thus in any way understand that his will precedes. For who is <q>drawn,</q> if he was already willing? And yet no man comes unless he is willing. Therefore he is drawn in wondrous ways to will, by Him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to work within the very hearts of men. Not that men who are unwilling should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, which cannot be, but that they should be made willing from being unwilling.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38 [XX.]&mdash; The Power of God's Grace is Proved.</h2>

<p>That this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> we do not surmise by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conjecture, but we discern by the most evident authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>. It is read in the books of the Chronicles: <q>Also in Judah, the hand of God was made to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes in the word of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152609"><a href="../bible/2ch030.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;30:12</a></span> Also by Ezekiel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> the Lord says, <q>I will give them another heart, and a new spirit will I give them; and I will take away their stony heart out of their flesh, and I will give them an heart of flesh, that they may walk in my commandments and observe my judgments and do them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152610"><a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse26">Ezekiel&nbsp;36:26-27</a></span> And what is that which Esther the queen <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> when she says, <q>Give me eloquent speech in my mouth, and enlighten my words in the sight of the lion, and turn his heart to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of him that fights against us</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152611"><a href="../bible/est014.htm#verse13">Esther&nbsp;14:13</a></span> How does she say such things as these in her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if God does not work His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in men's hearts? But perchance the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was foolish in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> thus. Let us see, then, whether the desire of the petitioner was vainly sent on in advance, and whether the result did not follow as of one who heard. Lo, she goes in to the king. We need not say much. And because she did not approach him in her own order, under the compulsion of her great necessity, <q>he looked upon her,</q> as it is written, <q>like a bull in the impulse of his indignation. And the queen feared, and her colour was changed through faintness, and she bowed herself upon the head of her maid, who went before her. And God changed him, and converted his indignation into mildness.</q>  Now what need is there to relate what follows, where the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> testifies that God fulfilled what she had asked for by working in the heart of the king nothing other than the will by which he commanded, and it was done as the queen had asked of him? And now God had heard her that it should be done, who changed the heart of the king by a most secret and efficacious power before he had heard the address of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> beseeching him, and moulded it from indignation to mildness&mdash;that is, from the will to hurt, to the will to favour&mdash;according to that word of the apostle, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in you to will also.</q> Did the men of God who wrote these things&mdash; nay, did the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> Himself, under whose guidance such things were written by them&mdash; assail the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of man? Away with the notion! But He has commended both the most righteous judgment and the most merciful aid of the Omnipotent in all cases. For it is enough for man to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is no unrighteousness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But how He dispenses those benefits, making some deservedly vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, others graciously vessels of mercy&mdash;who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord, or who has been His counsellor? If, then, we attain to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, let us not be ungrateful by attributing to ourselves what we have received. <q>For what have we which we have not received?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152613"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 39 [XXI.]&mdash; Julian's Fifth Objection Concerning the Saints of the Old Testament.</h2>

<p><q>We say,</q> says he, <q>that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, their righteousness being perfected here, passed to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life&mdash;that is, that by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> they departed from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; because those whom we read of as having committed any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we nevertheless <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have amended themselves.</q> Of whatever <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> you may declare that the ancient righteous men were possessed, nothing saved them but the belief in the Mediator who shed His blood for the remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For their own word is, <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and therefore I spoke.</q>  Whence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> also says, <q>And we having the same Spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according as it is written, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and therefore have I spoken; we also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and therefore speak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152615"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> What is <q>the same Spirit,</q> but that Spirit whom these righteous men also had who said such things? The Apostle Peter also says, <q>Why do you wish to put a yoke upon the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, which neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear? But, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we shall be saved, even as they.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152616"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse10">Acts&nbsp;15:10-11</a></span> You who are enemies to this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> do not wish this, that the ancients should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been saved by the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; but you distribute the times according to Pelagius,  in whose books this is read, and you say that before the law men were saved by nature, then by the law, lastly by Christ, as if to men of the two former times, that is to say, before the law and under the law, the blood of Christ had not been necessary; making void what is said: <q>For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152618"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 40 [XXII.]&mdash; The Sixth Objection, Concerning the Necessity of Grace for All, and Concerning the Baptism of Infants.</h2>

<p>They say, <q>We confess that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ is necessary to all, both to grown-up people and to infants; and we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who say that a child born of two <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> people ought not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</q> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what sense you say such things as these&mdash; not according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, but according to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Pelagius;&mdash; to wit, that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is necessary for infants, not for the sake of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but only for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; for you give them outside the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> a place of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, even if they have not been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Nor do you regard what is written, <q>Whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be saved; but he who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not shall be condemned.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152619"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse16">Mark&nbsp;16:16</a></span> For which reason, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, infants <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> by means of other people, even as they have derived those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are remitted them in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from other people. Nor do you think thus, that they cannot have life who have been without the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although He said Himself, <q>Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you shall have no life in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152620"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;6:34</a></span> Or if you are forced by the words of the gospel to confess that infants departing from the body cannot have either life or <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> unless they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, ask why those who are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are compelled to undergo the judgment of the second death, by the judgment of Him who condemns nobody undeservingly, and you will find what you do not want&mdash;original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>!</p>

<h2>Chapter 41 [XXIII.]&mdash; The Seventh Objection, of the Effect of Baptism.</h2>

<p><q>We condemn,</q> says he, <q>those who affirm that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does not do away all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that full cleansing is conferred by these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>.</q> We also say this; but you do not say that infants are also by those same <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> freed from the bonds of their first birth and of their hateful descent. On which account it behooves you, like other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> also, to be separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which holds this of old time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42 [XXIV.]&mdash; He Rebuts the Conclusion of Julian's Letter.</h2>

<p>But now the manner in which he concludes the letter by saying, <q>Let no one therefore seduce you, nor let the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deny that they think these things. But if they speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, either let a hearing be given, or let those very <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who now disagree with me condemn what I have above said that they hold with the Manicheans, as we condemn those things which they declare concerning us, and a full agreement shall be made; but if they will not, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are Manicheans, and abstain from their company;</q>&mdash; this is rather to be despised than rebuked. For which of us hesitates to pronounce an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against the Manicheans, who say that from the good God neither proceed men, nor was ordained marriage, nor was given the law, which was ministered to the Hebrew people by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>! But against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> also, not without reason, we pronounce an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, for that they are so hostile to God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which comes through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, as to say that it is given not freely, but according to our merits, and thus <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note152621"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;11:6</a></span> and place so much in <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> by which man is plunged into the abyss, as to say that by making good use of it man deserves <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>&mdash;although no man can make good use of it except by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is not repaid according to debt, but is given freely by God's mercy. And they so contend that infants are already saved, that they dare deny that they are to be saved by the Saviour. And holding and disseminating these execrable <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, they still over and above constantly demand a hearing, when, as condemned, they ought to repent.</p>
