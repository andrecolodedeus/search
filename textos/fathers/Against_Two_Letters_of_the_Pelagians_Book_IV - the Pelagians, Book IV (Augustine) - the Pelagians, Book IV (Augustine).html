<h1>Against Two Letters of the Pelagians (Book IV)</h1>

<p>After having set aside in the former books the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> hurled against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Augustine here proceeds to open up the snares which lie hidden in the remaining part of the second epistle of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, in the five heads of their doctrine&mdash; in the praise, to wit, of the creature, the praise of marriage, the praise of the law, the praise of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and the praise of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; in connection with which heads the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> malignantly boast that they are at issue not more with the Manicheans than with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Hence these five points may bring us back to this, that they put forward their threefold <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>&mdash; namely, the two first, the denial of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; the two following, the assertion that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given according to merits; the fifth, their statement that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in this life. Augustine shows that both <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, that of the Manicheans and that of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, are opposed and equally odious to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby we profess, first, that the nature created by a good God was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but that, nevertheless, it is in need of a Saviour because of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which passed into all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from the transgression of the first man: then secondly, that marriage is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that that concupiscence is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which was associated with marriage by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: also thirdly that the law of God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but in such wise as only to manifest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not to take it away: that fourthly <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is assuredly inherent in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but that now, however, it is so enslaved that it does not avail to the doing of righteousness, unless when it shall have been made free by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: but that fifthly the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, whether of the Old or <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, were indeed endued with a righteousness, which was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> but not perfect, nor so full that they should be free from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In conclusion, he brings forward the testimonies of Cyprian and Ambrose on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, some concerning original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, others about the assistance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and the last concerning the imperfection of present righteousness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1 [I.]&mdash; The Subterfuges of the Pelagians are Five.</h2>

<p>After the matters which I have considered, and to which I have answered, they repeat the same things as those contained in the letter which I have refuted, but in a different manner. For before, they put them forward as objecting to us things which we think as it were <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>; but afterwards, as explaining what they themselves think, they have presented the same things from the opposite side, adding two certain points which they had not mentioned&mdash; that is, <q>that they say that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is necessary for all ages,</q> and <q>that by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> death passed upon us, not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> which things must also themselves be considered in their own place. Hence, because in the former Book which I have just finished I said that they alleged hindrances of five matters in which lurk their <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> hostile to God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and to the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash;the praise, to wit, of the creature, the praise of marriage, the praise of the law, the praise of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, the praise of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>&mdash;I think it is more convenient to make a general discrimination of all that they maintain, the contrary of which they object to us, and to show which of those things pertain to any of those five, that so my answer may be by that very distinction clearer and briefer.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2 [II.]&mdash; The Praise of the Creature.</h2>

<p>They accomplish the praise of the creature, inasmuch as it pertains to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> of which the question now is, in these statements: <q>That God is the Maker of all those that are born, and that the sons of men are God's work; and that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> descends not from nature, but from the will.</q> With this praise of the creature they connect, <q>that they say that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is necessary for every age, so that,</q> namely, <q>the creature itself may be adopted among the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not because it derives anything from its <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> which must be purified in the laver of regeneration.</q> To this praise they add also, <q>that they say that Christ the Lord was sprinkled with no stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as far as pertains to His infancy;</q> because they assert that His flesh was most pure from all contagion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not by His own excellence and singular <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but by His fellowship with the nature which is shared by all infants. It also belongs to this that they introduce the question <q>of the origin of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,</q> thus endeavouring to make all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of infants equal to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, maintaining that they likewise are sprinkled with no stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On this account, also, they say, <q>that nothing of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> passed from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> upon the rest of humanity except death, which,</q> they say, <q>is not always an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, for instance, it is for the sake of rewards; and it is not the dissolution of the bodies, which in every kind of men shall be raised up, that can make death to be called either good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but the diversity of merits which arises from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> liberty.</q> These things they write in this letter concerning the praise of the creature.</p>

<p>They praise marriage <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, <q>because the Lord says in the gospel, He who made men from the beginning made them male and female, and said, Increase and multiply, and replenish the earth.</q> Although this is not written in that passage of the gospel, yet it is written in the law. They add, moreover, <q>What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152775"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;19:4</a></span> And these we acknowledge to be gospel words.</p>

<p>In the praise of the law they say, <q>that the old law was, according to the apostle, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just and good; that on those who keep its commandments, and live righteously by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and patriarchs, and all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> could be conferred.</q></p>

<p>In the praise of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> they say, <q>that <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> has not perished, since the Lord says by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, 'If you be willing and will hear me, you shall eat the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the land: if you are unwilling, and will not hear, the sword shall devour you.' <span class="stiki" id="note152776"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;1:19</a></span> And thus, also, it is that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> assists the good purpose of any person, but yet does not infuse a desire of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> into the reluctant heart, because there is no acceptance of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>In the praise of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> they conceal themselves, saying <q>that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> perfectly renews men, inasmuch as the apostle is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> who testifies that, by the washing of water, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is made out of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and spotless; <span class="stiki" id="note152777"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse26">Ephesians&nbsp;5:26</a></span> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also assisted <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in ancient times, even as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, 'Your good Spirit shall lead me into the right way;'  that all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, moreover, and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> or <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as well of the New as of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, to whom God gives <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, were righteous, not in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but by the rule of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and that in future time there is a reward as well of good works as of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But that no one can then perform the commandment which here he may have contemned, because the apostle said, 'We must be manifested before the judgment-seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that every one may receive the things belonging to the body, according to what he has done, whether good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152779"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:10</a></span> </p>

<p>In all these points, whatever they say of the praise of the creature and of marriage, they endeavour to bring us back to this&mdash;that there is no original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; whatever of the praise of law and of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, to this, that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not assist without merit, and that thus <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; whatever of the praise of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, to this, that mortal life in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> appears not to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that it is not necessary for them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> God for the remitting of their debts.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3 [III.]&mdash; The Catholics Praise Nature, Marriage, Law, Free Will, and the Saints, in Such Wise as to Condemn as Well Pelagians as Manicheans.</h2>

<p>Let every one who, with a catholic <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, shudders at these impious and damnable doctrines, in this tripartite division, shun the lurking-places and snares of this fivefold <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and be so careful between one and another as in such wise to decline from the Manicheans as not to incline to the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>; and again, so to separate himself from the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> as not to associate himself with the Manicheans; or, if he should already be taken hold of in one or the other bondage, that he should not so pluck himself out of the hands of either as to rush into those of the other. Because they seem to be contrary to one another; since the Manicheans manifest themselves by vituperating these five points, and the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> conceal themselves by praising them. Wherefore he condemns and shuns both, whoever he may be, who according to the rule of the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> so glorifies the Creator in men, that are born of the good creature of flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (for this the Manichean will not have), as that he yet confesses that on account of the corruption which has passed over into them by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first man, even infants need a Saviour (for this the Pelagian will not have). He who so distinguishes the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of shameful concupiscence from the blessing of marriage, as neither, like the Manicheans, to reproach the source of our birth, nor, like the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, to praise the source of our disorder. He who so maintains the law to have been given <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just and good through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just and good God (which Manicheus, in opposition to the apostle, denies), as to say that it both shows forth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and yet does not take it away, and commands righteousness which yet it does not give (which, again, in opposition to the apostle, Pelagius denies). He who so asserts <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> as to say that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and man began, not from I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what nature always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which is no nature, but from the will itself, which overturns Manichean <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and nevertheless that even thus the captive will cannot breathe into a wholesome liberty save by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which overturns the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. He who so praises in God the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only after Christ manifested in the flesh and subsequently, but even those of the former times, whom the Manicheans dare to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>, as yet to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> their own confessions concerning themselves, more than the lies of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. For the word of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is, <q>If we should say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152780"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 4 [IV.]&mdash; Pelagians and Manicheans on the Praise of the Creature.</h2>

<p>These things being so, what advantage is it to new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, enemies of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and opposers of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, that they seem sound from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the Manicheans, if they are dying by another pestilence of their own? What advantage is it to them, that in the praise of the creature they say <q>that the good God is the maker of those that are born, by whom all things were made, and that the children of men are His work,</q> whom the Manicheans say are the work of the prince of darkness; when between them both, or among them both, God's creation, which is in infants, is perishing? For both of them refuse to have it delivered by Christ's flesh and blood,&mdash; the one, because they destroy that very flesh and blood, as if He did not take upon Him these at all in man or of man; and the other, because they assert that there is no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in infants from which they should be delivered by the sacrament of this flesh and blood. Between them lies the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> creature in infants, with a good origination, with a corrupted propagation, confessing for its goods a most excellent Creator, seeking for its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> a most merciful Redeemer, having the Manicheans as disparagers of its benefits, having the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> as deniers of its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and both as persecutors. And although in infancy there is no power to speak, yet with its silent look and its hidden weakness it addresses the impious vanity of both, saying to the one, <q>Believe that I am created by Him who creates <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things;</q> and saying to the other, <q>Allow me to be healed by Him who created me.</q> The Manicheans say, <q>There is nothing of this infant save the good <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be delivered; the rest,</q> which belongs not to the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to the prince of darkness, <q>is to be rejected.</q> The <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> say, <q>Certainly there is nothing of this infant to be delivered, because we have shown the whole to be safe.</q> Both lie; but now the accuser of the flesh alone is more bearable than the praiser, who is convicted of cruelty against the whole. But neither does the Manichean help the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Author of the entire man; nor does the Pelagian permit the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> to come to the help of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infancy by denying original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it is by the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that God has mercy, seeing that by condemning both mischievous doctrines it comes to the help of the infant for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. It says to the Manicheans, <q>Hear the apostle crying, 'Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your body is the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in you?' <span class="stiki" id="note152781"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:19</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the good God is the Creator of bodies, because the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> cannot be the work of the prince of darkness.</q> It says to the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, <q>The infant that you look upon 'was conceived in iniquity, and in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> its mother nourished it in the womb.'  Why, as if in defending it as free from all mischief, do you not permit it to be delivered by mercy? No one is pure from uncleanness, not even the infant whose life is of one day upon the earth.  Allow the wretched creatures to receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, through Him who alone neither as small nor great could have any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; What is the Special Advantage in the Pelagian Opinions?</h2>

<p>What advantage, then, is it to them that they say <q>that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> descends not from nature, but from the will,</q> and resist by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this judgment the Manicheans, who say that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> nature is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; when by being unwilling to admit original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> although itself also descends from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the first man, they make infants to depart in guilt from the body? What advantage is it to them <q>that they confess that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is necessary for all ages,</q> while the Manicheans say that it is superfluous for every age, while they say that in infants it is false so far as it pertains to the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? What advantage is it to them that they maintain <q>the flesh of Christ</q> (which the Manicheans contend was either no flesh at all, or a feigned flesh) to have been not only the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh, but also <q>that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself was stained by no spot of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> when other infants are by them so put on the same level with His infancy, with not unequal purity, as that both that flesh does not appear to keep its own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in comparison with these, and these obtain no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from that?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; Not Death Alone, But Sin Also Has Passed into Us by Means of Adam.</h2>

<p>In that particular, indeed, wherein they say <q>that death passed to us by Adam, not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> they have not the Manicheans as their adversaries: since they, too, deny that original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from the first man, at first of pure and upright body and spirit, and afterwards depraved by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, subsequently passed and passes as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> into all with death; but they say that the flesh was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from the beginning, and was created by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit and along with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit; but that a good <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash; a portion, to wit, of God&mdash; for the deserts of its defilement by food and drink, in which it was before bound up, came into man, and thus by means of copulation was bound in the chain of the flesh. And thus the Manicheans agree with the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> that it was not the guilt of the first man that passed into the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>&mdash; neither by the flesh, which they say was never good; nor by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which they assert comes into the flesh of man with the merits of its own defilements with which it was polluted before the flesh. But how do the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> say <q>that only death passed upon us by Adam's means</q>? For if we die because he died, but he died because be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, they say that the punishment passed without the guilt, and that innocent infants are punished with an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> penalty by deriving death without the deserts of death. This, the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of the one and only mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the man Christ Jesus, who condescended to undergo death&mdash; that is, the penalty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash; without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for us. As He alone became the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, in order that we might become through Him sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so He alone, on our behalf, undertook punishment without ill deservings, that we through Him might obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> without good deservings. Because as to us nothing good was due so to Him nothing bad was due. Therefore, commending His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to them to whom He was about to give undeserved life, He was willing to suffer for them an undeserved death. This special prerogative of the Mediator the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> endeavour to make void, so that this should no longer be special in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, if <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in such wise suffered a death due to him on account of his guilt, as that infants, drawing from him no guilt, should suffer undeserved death. For although very much good is conferred on the good by means of death, whence some have fitly argued even <q>of the benefit of death;</q> yet from this what can be declared except the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is converted into beneficent uses?</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; What is the Meaning of <q>In Whom All Have Sinned</q>?</h2>

<p>But these speak thus who wish to wrest men from the apostle's words into their own thought. For where the apostle says, <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152784"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> they will have it there understood not that <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></q> passed over, but <q>death.</q> What, then, is the meaning of what follows, <q>Whereto all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a></q>? For either the apostle says that in that <q>one man</q> all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> of whom he had said, <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world,</q> or else in that <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> or certainly in <q>death.</q> For it need not disturb us that he said not <q> <em>in which</em></q> [using the feminine form of the pronoun], but <q>in whom</q> [using the masculine] all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; since <q>death</q> in the Greek language is of the masculine gender. Let them, then, choose which they will,&mdash; for either in that <q>man</q> all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and it is so said because when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> all were in him; or in that <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></q> all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, because that was the doing of all in general which all those who were born would have to derive; or it remains for them to say that in that <q>death</q> all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. But in what way this can be understood, I do not clearly see. For all die in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; they do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the death; for when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> precedes, death follows&mdash; not when death precedes, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> follows. Because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the sting of death&mdash; that is, the sting by whose stroke death occurs, not the sting with which death strikes.  Just as poison, if it is drunk, is called the cup of death, because by that cup death is caused, not because the cup is caused by the death, or is given by death. But if <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></q> cannot be understood by those words of the apostle as being that <q>wherein all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>,</q> because in Greek, from which the Epistle is translated, <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></q> is expressed in the feminine gender, it remains that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are understood to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in that first <q>man,</q> because all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were in him when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; and from him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is derived by birth, and is not remitted save by being born again. For thus also the sainted Hilary understood what is written, <q>wherein all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>;</q> for he says, <q>wherein,</q> that is, in Adam, <q>all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q>  Then he adds, <q>It is manifest that all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in Adam, as it were in the mass; for he himself was corrupted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and all whom he begot were born under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> When he wrote this, Hilary, without any ambiguity, indicated how we should understand the words, <q>wherein all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; Death Passed Upon All by Sin.</h2>

<p>But on account of what does the same apostle say, that we are reconciled to God by Christ, except on account of what we had become enemies? And what is this but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Whence also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> separate between you and God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152787"><a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;59:2</a></span> On account of this separation, therefore, the Mediator was sent, that He might take away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world, by which we were separated as enemies, and that we, being reconciled, might be made from enemies children. About this, certainly, the apostle was speaking; hence it happened that he interposed what he says, <q>That <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered by one man.</q> For these are his former words. He says, <q>But God commends His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then, being now justified in His blood, we shall be saved from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> through Him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved in His life. And not only so, but glorying also in God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, by whom also we have now received reconciliation.</q> Then he subjoins, <q>Therefore, as by one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into this world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for in him all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q>  Why do the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> evade this matter? If reconciliation through Christ is necessary to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, on all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> has passed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by which we have become enemies, in order that we should have need of reconciliation. This reconciliation is in the laver of regeneration and in the flesh and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, without which not even infants can have life in themselves. For as there was one man for death on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so there is one man for life on account of righteousness; because <q>as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152789"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:22</a></span> and <q>as by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to condemnation, so also by the righteousness of one upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> unto justification of life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152790"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;5:18</a></span> Who is there that has turned a deaf ear to these <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> words with such hardiness of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> impiety, as, having heard them, to contend that death passed upon us through <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless, indeed, they are opposers of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and enemies of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>?&mdash; whose end is destruction if they continue in this obstinacy. But let it suffice to have said thus much for the sake of that serpentine subtlety of theirs, by which they wish to corrupt simple minds, and to turn them away from the simplicity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as if by the praise of the creature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9 [V.]&mdash; Of the Praise of Marriage.</h2>

<p>But further, concerning the praise of marriage,  what advantage is it to them that, in opposition to the Manicheans, who assign marriage not to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to the prince of darkness, these men resist the words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and say, <q>That the Lord speaks in the gospel, saying, Who from the beginning made them male and female, and said, Increase and multiply and replenish the earth. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152792"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;19:4</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> What does this profit them, by means of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to seduce to a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>? For they say this in order that infants may be thought to be born free from all fault, and thus that there is no need of their being reconciled to God through Christ, since they have no original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, on account of which reconciliation is necessary to all by means of one who came into the world without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, just as the enmities of all were caused by means of one through whom <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world. And this is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, without detracting from the praise of marriage; because the praise of marriage is a righteous intercourse of the sexes, not a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> defence of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. And thus, when, by their praise of marriage, these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> wish to draw over men from the Manicheans to themselves, they desire merely to change their disease, not to heal it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; Of the Praise of the Law.</h2>

<p>Once more, in the praise of the law, what advantage is it to them that, in opposition to the Manicheans, they say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when they wish to bring men from that view to this which they hold <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>? For they say, <q>We confess that even the old law, according to the apostle, is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just and good, and that this could confer <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life on those that kept its commandments, and lived righteously by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and patriarchs, and all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q> By which words, very craftily expressed, they praise the law in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for certainly that law, although just and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and good, could not confer <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life on all those men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, not according to the letter which kills, but according to the Spirit which makes alive, to which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God the law, as it were a schoolmaster, leads by deterring from transgression, that so that might be conferred upon man which it could not itself confer. For to those words of theirs in which they say <q>that the law was able to confer <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life on the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and patriarchs, and all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who kept its commandments,</q> the apostle replies, <q>If righteousness be by the law, then has Christ died in vain.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152793"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse21">Galatians&nbsp;2:21</a></span> <q>If the inheritance be by the law, then is it no more of promise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152794"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse18">Galatians&nbsp;3:18</a></span> <q>If they which are of the law be heirs, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is made void, and the promise is made of none effect.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152795"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;4:14</a></span> <q>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is evident: for, The just by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lives.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152796"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse11">Galatians&nbsp;3:11</a></span> <q>But the law is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: but The man that does them shall live in them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152797"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse12">Galatians&nbsp;3:12</a></span> Which testimony, quoted by the apostle from the law, is understood in respect of temporal life, in respect of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of losing which, men were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of doing the works of the law, not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; because the transgressors of the law were commanded by the same law to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the people. Or, if it must be understood more highly, that <q>He who does these things shall live in them</q> was written in reference to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; the power of the law is so expressed that the weakness of man in himself, itself failing to do what the law commands, might seek help from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God rather of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, seeing that by His mercy even <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself is bestowed.

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; The Pelagians Understand that the Law Itself is God's Grace.</h2>

<p>But those enemies of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> never endeavour to lay more secret snares for more vehement opposition to that same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than when they praise the law, which, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, is worthy to be praised.  Because, by their different modes of speaking, and by variety of words in all their arguments, they wish the law to be understood as <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></q>&mdash; that, to wit, we may have from the Lord God the help of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those things which have to be done&mdash;not the inspiration of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that, when <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, we may do them with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which is properly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2>Chapter 12 [VI.]&mdash; Of the Praise of Free Will.</h2>

<p>Moreover, that, in opposition to the Manicheans, they praise <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, making use of the prophetic testimony, <q>If you shall be willing and will hear me, you shall eat what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the land; but if you shall be unwilling and will not hear me, the sword shall consume you:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152809"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;1:19-20</a></span> what advantage is this to them, when, indeed, it is not so much against the Manicheans that they are maintaining, as against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> that they are extolling, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>? For they wish what is said, <q>If you be willing and will hear me,</q> to be so understood, as if in the preceding will itself were the merit of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that follows; and thus <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> were no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, seeing that it is not free when it is rendered as a debt. But if they should so understand what is written, <q>If you be willing,</q> as to confess that He prepares even that good will itself of whom it is written, <q>The will is prepared by the Lord,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152810"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse35">Proverbs&nbsp;8:35</a></span> they would use this testimony as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and not only would overcome the ancient <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Manicheans, but would not found the new one of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; God's Purposes are Effects of Grace.</h2>

<p>What does it profit them, that in the praise of that same <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> <q>they say that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> assists the good purpose of every one</q>?  This would be received without scruple as being said in a catholic spirit, if they did not attribute merit to the good purpose, to which merit now a wage is paid of debt, not according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but would understand and confess that even that very good purpose, which the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which follows assists could not have been in the man if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> had not preceded it. For how is there a good purpose in a man without the mercy of God first, since it is that very good will which is prepared by the Lord? <span class="stiki" id="note152812"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse35">Proverbs&nbsp;8:35</a></span> But when they had said this, <q>that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> also assists every one's good purpose,</q> and presently added, <q>yet does not infuse the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> into a resisting heart,</q> it might be fitly understood, if it were not said by those whose meaning is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For, for the resisting heart a hearing for the divine call is first procured by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God itself, and then in that heart, now no more resisting, the desire of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is kindled. Nevertheless, in all things which any one does according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His mercy precedes him. And this they will not have, because they choose to be not <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. For it much delights a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> impiety, that even that which a man is forced to confess to be given by the Lord should seem to be not bestowed on himself, but repaid; so that, to wit, the children of perdition, not of the promise, may be thought themselves to have made themselves good, and God to have repaid to those who are now good, having been made so by themselves, the reward due for that their work.</p>

For He says, <q>These things says the Lord God: I do not this for your sakes, O house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but for my own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name's sake, which has been profaned among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, whither you have gone in there; and I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and which you have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the Lord, says Adonai the Lord, when I shall be sanctified among you before their eyes.

And I will sprinkle upon you clean water, and you shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, and I will cleanse you. And I will give unto you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you: and the stony heart shall be taken away out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to walk in my righteousness, and to observe my judgments, and do them.</q>  And after a few words, by the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> He says, <q>Not for your sakes do I do this, says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>; it shall be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you: be ye confounded and blush for your ways, O house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. These things says the Lord God: In the day in which I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, and shall ordain cities, and the wilderness shall be built, and the desolated land shall be tilled, whereas it was desolated before the eyes of every passer by. And they shall say, This land that was desolated has become as a garden of pleasure; and the wasted and desolated and ruined cities have settled down fortified. And whatever nations have been left round about you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I the Lord have built the ruined places, I have planted the desolated places: I the Lord have spoken, and have done it.

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; From Such Scriptures Grace is Proved to Be Gratuitous and Effectual.</h2>

<p>What remained to the carrion skin whence it might be puffed up, and could disdain when it glories to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord? <span class="stiki" id="note152824"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:31</a></span> What remained to it, when whatsoever it shall have said that it has done in such a way that after that preceding merit of man had originated from man, God should subsequently do that of which the man is deserving&mdash;it shall be answered, it shall be exclaimed against, it shall be contradicted, <q>I do it; but for my own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name's sake; not for your sakes, do I do it, says the Lord God</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152825"><a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse22">Ezekiel&nbsp;36:22</a></span> Nothing so overturns the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> when they say that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is given in respect of our merits. Which, indeed, Pelagius himself condemned,  and if not by correcting it, yet by being afraid of the Eastern judges. Nothing so overturns the presumption of men who say, <q>We do it, that we may deserve those things with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may do it.</q> It is not Pelagius that answers you, but the Lord Himself, <q>I do it and not for your sakes, but for my own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name's sake.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152827"><a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse22">Ezekiel&nbsp;36:22</a></span> For what good can you do out of a heart which is not good?

But what good would ye <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men do, and how should you do those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, unless you were yourselves good? But who causes that men should be good save Him who said, <q>And I will visit them to make them good</q>? And who said <q>I will put my Spirit within you, and will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to walk in my righteousness, and to observe my judgments, and do them</q>? Are ye thus not yet awake? Do ye not yet hear, <q>I will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to walk, I will make you to observe,</q> lastly, <q>I will make you to do</q>? What! Are you still puffing yourselves up? We indeed walk, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; we observe; we do; but He makes us to walk, to observe, to do. This is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God making us good; this is His mercy preventing us. What do waste and desolated and dug-up places deserve, which yet shall be built and tilled and fortified? Are these things for the merits of their wasteness, their desolation, their uprooting? Far from it. For such things as these are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deservings, while those gifts are good. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are given for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ones&mdash; gratuitous, therefore; not of debt, and therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. <q>I,</q> says the Lord: <q>I, the Lord.</q> Does not such a word as that restrain you, O <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, when you say, I do such things as to deserve from the Lord to be built and planted? Do you not hear, <q>I do it not on your account; I the Lord have built up the destroyed cities, and I have planted the desolated lands; I the Lord have spoken, and I have done it, yet not for your sakes, but for my own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name's sake</q>? Who multiplies men as sheep, as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem? Who causes those desolated cities to be full of men as sheep, save He who goes on, and says, <q>And they shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the Lord</q>? But with what men as sheep does He fill the cities as He promised? Those which He finds, or those which He makes? Let us interrogate the Psalm; lo, it answers; let us hear: <q>O come, let us worship and fall down before Him: and let us weep before the Lord who made us; because He is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand.</q>  He therefore makes the sheep, with which He may fill the desolated cities. What wonder, when, indeed, to that single sheep, that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whose members are all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sheep, it is said, <q>Because I am the Lord who make you</q>? What do you pretend to me of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, which will not be free to do righteousness, unless you should be a sheep?

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; Why God Makes of Some Sheep, Others Not.</h2>

<p>But wherefore does God make these men sheep, and those not, since with Him there is no acceptance of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>? This is the very question which the blessed apostle thus answers to those who propose it with more curiosity than propriety, <q>O man, who are you that repliest against God? Does the thing formed say to him that formed it, Wherefore have you made me thus?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152829"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;9:20</a></span> This is the very question which belongs to that depth desiring to look into which the same apostle was in a certain measure terrified, and exclaimed, <q>Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! For who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counsellor? Or who has first given to Him, that it should be recompensed to Him again? Because of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things: to Him be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ages of ages.</q>  Let them not, then, dare to pry into that unsearchable question who defend merit before <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and therefore even against <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and wish first to give unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that it may be given to them again&mdash;first, of course, to give something of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be given them again as a reward; and let them wisely understand or faithfully <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that even what they think that they have first given, they have received from Him, from whom are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things. But why this man should receive, and that should not receive, when neither of them deserves to receive, and whichever of them receives, receives undeservingly,&mdash; let them measure their own strength, and not search into things too strong for them. Let it suffice them to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is no unrighteousness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For when the apostle could find no merits for which Jacob should take precedence of his twin-brother with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he said, <q>What, then, shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? Away with the thought! For He says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will show compassion on whom I will show compassion. Therefore it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.</q>  Let, therefore, His free compassion be grateful to us, even although this profound question be still unsolved; which, nevertheless, is so far solved as the same apostle solves it, saying, <q>But if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, willing to show His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and to demonstrate His power, endured in much patience the vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> which are fitted to destruction; and that He might make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on the vessels of mercy, which He has prepared for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152832"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse22">Romans&nbsp;9:22-23</a></span> Certainly <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is not repaid unless it is due, lest there be unrighteousness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but mercy, even when it is bestowed, and not due, is not unrighteousness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And hence, let the vessels of mercy understand how freely mercy is afforded to them, because to the vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> with whom they have common <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and measure of perdition, is repaid <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, righteous and due. This is now enough in opposition to those who, by freedom of will, desire to destroy the liberality of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; The Opinion of the Saints Themselves About Themselves.</h2>

<p>It is to be confessed that <q>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, even in the old times,</q> not only <q>aided good dispositions,</q> which even they allow, but that it even made them good, which they will not have. <q>That all, also, of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> or <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, both evangelical and ancient, to whom God gives His <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, were righteous, not in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but by the rule of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>,</q> is not doubtful. And this is opposed to the Manicheans, who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; but what is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> is, that all of these, when interrogated concerning themselves while they lived in the body, with one most accordant voice would answer, <q>If we should say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152839"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> <q>But in the future time,</q> it is not to be denied <q>that there will be a reward as well of good works as of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that no one will be commanded to do the commandments there which here he has contemned,</q> but that a sufficiency of perfect righteousness where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be, a righteousness which is here hungered and thirsted after by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, is here hoped for in precept, is there received as a reward, on the entreaty of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; so that what here may have been wanting in fulfilment of the commandments may become unpunished for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; The Craft of the Pelagians.</h2>

<p>And if these things be so, let the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> cease by their most insidious praises of these five things&mdash; that is, the praise of the creature, the praise of marriage, the praise of the law, the praise of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, the praise of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>&mdash; from feigning that they desire to pluck men, as it were, from the little snares of the Manicheans, in order that they may entangle them in their own nets&mdash; that is, that they may deny original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; may begrudge to infants the aid of Christ the physician; may say that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is given according to our merits, and thus that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and may say that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in this life had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and thus make the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of none effect which He gave to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and by which all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is pardoned to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unto Him. To these three <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doctrines, they by their deceitful praise of these five <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things seduce careless and unlearned men. Concerning all which things, I think I have sufficiently censured their most cruel and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> vanity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20 [VIII.]&mdash; The Testimonies of the Ancients Against the Pelagians.</h2>

<p>But since they say <q>that their enemies have taken up our words for <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> and complained that <q>throughout nearly the whole of the West a dogma not less foolish than impious is taken up, and from simple <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sitting in their places without a Synodal congregation a subscription is extorted to confirm this dogma,</q>&mdash; although the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, both Western and Eastern shuddered at the profane novelties of their words&mdash; I think it belongs to my care not only to avail myself of the sacred canonical Scriptures as witnesses against them, which I have already sufficiently done, but, moreover, to bring forward some <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from the writings of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men who before us have treated upon those Scriptures with the most widespread <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> and great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Not that I would put the authority of any controversialist on a level with the canonical books, as if there were nothing which is better or more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> thought by one catholic than by another who likewise is a catholic; but that those may be admonished who think that these men say anything as it used to be said, before their empty talk on these subjects, by catholic teachers following the divine oracles, and may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and anciently established catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is by us defended against the receding presumption and mischief of the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; Pelagius, in Imitation of Cyprian, Wrote a Book of Testimonies.</h2>

<p>Even that heresiarch of these men, Pelagius himself, mentions with the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> that is certainly due to him, the most blessed Cyprian, most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> with even the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, not only in the African and the Western, but also in the Eastern Churches, well known by the report of fame, and by the diffusion far and wide of his writings&mdash;when, writing a book of testimonies,  he asserts that he is imitating him, saying that <q>he was doing to Romanus what Cypria had done to Quirinus.</q> Let us, then, see what Cyprian thought concerning original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which entered by one man into the world. In the epistle on <q>Works and Alms</q>  he thus speaks: <q>When the Lord at His advent had cured these wounds which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had introduced, and had healed the old poisons of the serpent, He gave a law to the sound man, and bade him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more, lest a worse thing should happen to him if he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. We had been limited and shut up into a narrow space by the commandment of innocence; nor would the infirmity and weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty have any resource unless the divine mercy coming once more in aid should open some way of securing <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by pointing out works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and mercy, so that by <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> we may wash away whatever foulness we subsequently contract.</q> By this testimony this <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> refutes two falsehoods of theirs&mdash;the one, wherein they say that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> draws no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> which needs cure and healing through Christ; the other, in which they say that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Again, in the same epistle  he says, <q>Let each one place before his eyes the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> with his servants&mdash;that is, with the people of perdition and death&mdash;as springing forth into the midst and provoking the people of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash;Himself being present and judging,&mdash; with the trial of comparison in these words: 'I, on behalf of those whom you see with me, neither received buffets, nor bore scourgings, nor endured the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, nor shed my blood, nor redeemed my <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at the price of my suffering and blood; but neither do I promise them a celestial kingdom, nor do I recall them to Paradise, having again restored to them <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.'</q> Let the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> answer and say when we could have been in the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of Paradise, and how we could have been expelled thence so as to be recalled there by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And, although they may be unable to find what they can answer in this case on behalf of their own perversity, let them observe in what manner Cyprian understood what the apostle says, <q>In whom all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> And let not the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, freed from the old Manichean <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, dare to suggest any <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> against a catholic, lest they should be convicted of doing so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> a wrong even to the ancient <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Cyprian.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; Further References to Cyprian.</h2>

<p>For he says also this in the epistle whose title is inscribed, <q>On the Mortality:</q>  <q>The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, beloved brethren, is beginning to be at hand; the reward of life, and the rejoicing of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and perpetual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, and the possession formerly lost of Paradise, are now coming with the passing away of the world.</q> This again, in the same epistle, he says: <q>Let us greet the day which assigns each of us to his own home, which snatches us hence and sets us free from the snares of the world, and restores us to Paradise and the kingdom.</q> Moreover, he says in the epistle concerning Patience: <q>Let the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> be pondered, which, even in the beginning of the world and of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, Adam, forgetful of the commandment and a transgressor of the law that had been given, received. Then we shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how patient in this life we ought to be, who are born in such a state that we labour here with afflictions and contests. Because, says He, 'you have hearkened to the voice of your wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which alone I had charged you that you should not eat, cursed shall be the ground in all your works: in sorrow and in groaning shall you eat of it all the days of your life. Thorns and thistles shall it give forth to you, and you shall eat the food of the field. In the sweat of your face you shall eat your bread, till you return unto the ground from which you were taken: for earth you are, and unto earth shall you go.' We are all tied and bound with the chain of this sentence until, death being destroyed, we depart from this world.</q>  And, moreover, in the same epistle he says: <q>For, since in that first transgression of the commandment strength of body departed with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and weakness came on with death, and strength cannot be received unless when <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> also has been received, it behooves us in this bodily frailty and weakness always to struggle and fight; and this struggle and encounter cannot be sustained but by the strength of patience.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; Further References to Cyprian.</h2>

<p>And in the epistle which he wrote with sixty-six of his joint-<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to Bishop Fidus, when he was consulted by him in respect of the law of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, whether an infant might be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> before the eighth day, this matter is treated in such a way as if by a divine forethought the catholic Church would already confute the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who would appear so long afterwards. For he who had consulted had no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on the subject whether children on birth inherited original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which they might wash away by being born again. For be it far from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to have at any time <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> on this matter. But he was in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether the washing of regeneration, by which he made no question but that original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was put away, ought to be given before the eighth day. To which consultation the most blessed Cyprian in reply said: <q>But as regards the case of infants, which you say ought not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> within the second or third day after their birth, and that the law of the ancient <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> should be regarded, so that you think that one who is born should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and sanctified within the eighth day, we all thought very differently in our council. For to the course which you thought was to be taken no one agreed, but we all rather judged that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of a merciful God was not to be denied to any one born of men; for, as the Lord says in His gospel, 'the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.' <span class="stiki" id="note152847"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse56">Luke&nbsp;9:56</a></span> As far as we can, we must strive that, if possible, no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be lost.</q>  And a little afterwards he says: <q>Nor ought any of us to shudder at what God has condescended to make. For although the infant is still fresh from its birth, yet it is not such that any one should shudder at kissing it in giving <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and in making peace, since in the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of an infant every one of us ought for his very religion's sake to consider the still recent hands of God themselves, which in some sort we are kissing in the man just formed and newly born, when we are embracing that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made.</q>  A little after, also, he says: <q>But if anything could hinder men from obtaining <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, their more heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> might rather hinder those who are mature and grown up and older. But again, if even to the greatest sinners, and to those who have before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> much against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when they have subsequently <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is granted, and nobody is hindered from <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; how much rather ought we to shrink from hindering an infant, who, being lately born, has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, except that, being born after the flesh according to Adam, he has contracted the contagion of the ancient death at his earliest birth; who approaches more easily on this very account to the reception of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in that to him are remitted not his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of another!</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; The Dilemma Proposed to the Pelagians.</h2>

<p>What will be said to such things as these, by those who are not only the forsakers, but also the persecutors of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? What will they say to such things as these? On what ground is the <q>possession of Paradise</q> restored to us? How are we restored to Paradise if we have never been there? Or how have we been there, except because we were there in Adam? And how do we belong to that <q>judgment</q> which was spoken against the transgressor, if we do not inherit injury from the transgressor? Finally, he thinks that infants are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, even before the eighth day; lest <q>by the contagion of the ancient death, contracted in the first birth,</q> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the infants should perish. How do they perish if they who are born even of believing men are not held by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> until they are born again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and plucked out from the power of darkness, and transferred into His kingdom? And who says that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those who are born will perish unless they are born again? No other than he who so praises the Creator and the creature, the workman and the work, as to restrain and correct the horror of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feeling with which men refuse to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> infants fresh from the womb, by interposing the veneration of the Creator Himself, saying that in the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of infants of that age the recent hands of God were to be considered! Did he, then, in confessing original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, condemn either nature or marriage? Did he, because he applied to the infant born guilty from Adam, the cleansing of regeneration, therefore deny God as the Creator of those that were born? Because, in his dread that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of any age whatever should perish, he, with his council of colleagues, decided that even before the eighth day they were to be delivered by the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, did he therefore accuse marriage, when, indeed, in the case of an infant&mdash;whether born of marriage or of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, yet because it was born a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>&mdash;he declared that the recent hands of God were worthy even of the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of peace? If, then, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Cyprian could think that original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in infants must be healed by the medicine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, without denying the praise of the creature, without denying the praise of marriage, why does a novel pestilence, although it does not dare to call such an one as him a Manichean, think that another person's fault is to be objected against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who maintain these things, in order to conceal its own? So the most lauded commentator on the divine declarations, before even the slightest taint of the Manichean plague had touched our lands, without any reproach of the divine work and of marriage, confesses original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash;not saying that Christ was stained with any spot of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor yet comparing with Him the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in others that were born, to whom by means of the likeness of sinful flesh He might afford the aid of cleansing; neither is he deterred by the obscure question of the origin of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, from confessing that those who are made free by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ return into Paradise. Does he say that the condition of death passed upon men from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> without the contagion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? For it is not on account of avoiding the death of the body, but on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which entered by one man into the world, <span class="stiki" id="note152851"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> that he says that help is to be afforded by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to infants, however fresh they may be from the womb.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25 [IX.]&mdash; Cyprian's Testimonies Concerning God's Grace.</h2>

<p>But now it plainly appears in what way Cyprian proclaims the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God against such as these, when he is arguing about the Lord's Prayer. For he says: <q>We say, 'May Your name be made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,'  not that we wish for God that He may be made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> by our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, but that we beseech of Him that His name may be made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in us. But by whom is God made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, since He Himself makes <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>? But, because He says, 'Be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, because I also am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,' we ask and entreat this, that we who were made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> may continue in that which we have begun to be.</q>  And in another place in the same epistle he says: <q>We add also, and say, 'Your will be done in heaven, and in earth,' not in order that God may do what He wills, but that we may be able to do what God wills. For who resists God that He may not do what He wills? But, since we are hindered by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> from <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> God with our thought and deed in all things, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and ask that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> may be done in us. And that it may be done in us, we have need of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, that is, of His help and protection; since no one is strong in his own strength, but he is safe by the indulgence and mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  In another place also: <q>Moreover, we ask that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be done both in heaven and in earth, each of which things pertains to the fulfilment of our safety and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For since we possess the body from the earth, and the spirit from heaven, we are ourselves earth and heaven; and in both, that is, both in body and in spirit, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be done. For between the flesh and the spirit there is a struggle, and there is a daily strife as they disagree one with the other; so that we cannot do the very things that we would, in that the spirit seeks heavenly and divine things, while the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> after earthly and temporal things. And, therefore, we ask that, by the help and assistance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, agreement may be made between these two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; so that while the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is done both in the spirit and in the flesh, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is newborn by Him may be preserved. And this the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> openly and manifestly declares by his words. 'The flesh,' says he, '<a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other, so that you cannot do the things that you would.'</q>  And a little after he says: <q>And it may be thus understood, most beloved brethren, that since the Lord commands and teaches us even to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our enemies, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> even for those who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> us, we should ask even for those who are still earth, and have not yet begun to be heavenly, that even in respect of these <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> may be done, which Christ accomplished in preserving and renewing humanity.</q>  And again, in another place he says: <q>But we ask that this bread should be given to us daily, that we who are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and daily receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> for the food of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, may not, by the interposition of some more heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash;by being prevented, as those abstaining and not communicating, from partaking of the heavenly bread&mdash;be separated from Christ's body.</q>  And a little afterwards, in the same treatise he says: <q>But when we ask that we may not come into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, we are reminded of our infirmity and weakness, while we so ask as that no one should insolently vaunt himself; that none should proudly and arrogantly assume anything to himself; that none should take to himself the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> either of confession or of suffering as his own, when the Lord Himself teaching humility said, 'Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, that you come not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak;'  so that while a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and submissive confession comes first, and all is attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whatever is sought for suppliantly, with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may be granted by His own loving-kindness.</q>  Moreover, in his treatise addressed to Quirinus, in respect to which work Pelagius wishes himself to appear as his imitator, he says in the Third Book <q>that we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.</q>  And subjoining the divine testimonies to this proposition, he added among others that apostolic word with which especially the mouths of such as these must be closed: <q>For what have you, which you have not received? But if you have received it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?</q> Also in the epistle concerning Patience he says: <q>For we have this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in common with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From Him patience begins; from Him its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and its dignity take their rise. The origin and greatness of patience proceed from God as its Author.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; Further Appeals to Cyprian's Teaching.</h2>

<p>Does that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and so memorable instructor of the Churches in the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, deny that there is <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> in men, because he attributes to God the whole of your righteous living? Does he reproach God's law, because he intimates that man is not justified by it, seeing that he declares that what that law commands must be obtained from the Lord God by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>? Does he assert <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by saying that we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own? Does he, like these, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is in such wise the aider of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as if that very <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which it assists springs from ourselves, when, asserting that nothing is our own, he mentions in this respect that the apostle said, <q>For what have you that you have not received?</q> and says that the most excellent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that is, patience, does not begin from us, and afterwards receive aid by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, but from Him Himself takes its source, from Him takes its origin? Finally, he confesses that neither good purpose, nor desire of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, nor good dispositions, begin to be in men without God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, when he says that <q>we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.</q> What is so established in <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> as what the law says, that we must not worship an idol, must not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, must do no <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>? Nay, these crimes, and such like, are of such a kind that, if any one should commit them, he is removed from the communion of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And yet, if the blessed Cyprian thought that our own will was sufficient for not committing these crimes, he would not in such wise understand what we say in the Lord's Prayer, <q>Give us this day our daily bread,</q> as that he should assert that we ask <q>that we may not by the interposition of some heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash; by being prevented as abstaining, and not communicating, from partaking of the heavenly bread&mdash; be separated from Christ's body.</q> Let these new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> answer of a surety what good merit precedes, in men who are enemies of the name of Christ? For not only have they no good merit, but they have, moreover, the very worst merit. And yet, Cyprian even thus understands what we say in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Your will be done in heaven, and in earth:</q> that we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> also for those very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who in this respect are called <em>earth</em>. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, therefore, not only for the unwilling, but also for the objecting and resisting. What, then, do we ask, but that from unwilling they may be made willing; from objecting, consenting; from resisting, loving? And by whom, but by Him of whom it is written, <q>The will is prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152862"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse36">Proverbs&nbsp;8:36</a></span> Let them, then, who disdain, if they do not do any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and if they do any good, to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, not in themselves, but in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, learn to be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27 [X.]&mdash; Cyprian's Testimonies Concerning the Imperfection of Our Own Righteousness.</h2>

<p>Let us, then, see that third point, which in these men is not less shocking to every member of Christ and to His whole body&mdash;that they contend that there are in this life, or that there have been, righteous men having absolutely no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.  In which presumption they most manifestly contradict the Lord's Prayer, wherein, with truthful heart and with daily words, all the members of Christ cry aloud, <q>Forgive us our debts.</q> Let us see, then, what Cyprian, most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, thought of this&mdash;what he not only said for the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, not, of course, of the Manicheans, but of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but also committed to letters and to memory. In the epistle on <q>Works and Alms,</q> he says: <q>Let us then acknowledge, beloved brethren, the wholesome gift of the divine mercy, and let us who cannot be without some wound of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> heal our wounds by the spiritual remedies for the cleansing and purging of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Nor let any one so flatter himself with the notion of a pure and immaculate heart, as, in dependence on his own innocence, to think that the medicine needs not to be applied to his wounds; since it is written, 'Who shall boast that he has a clean heart, or who shall boast that he is pure from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?' <span class="stiki" id="note152864"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse9">Proverbs&nbsp;20:9</a></span> And again, in his epistle, John lays it down and says, 'If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.' <span class="stiki" id="note152865"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> But if no one can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and whoever should say that he is without fault is either <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> or foolish, how needful, how kind is the divine mercy, which, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that there are still found some wounds in those that have been healed, has given even after their healing wholesome remedies for the curing and healing of their wounds anew!</q>  Again, in the same treatise he says: <q>And since there cannot fail daily to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there failed not daily <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> wherewith the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> might be cleansed away.</q>  Also, in the treatise on the Mortality, he says: <q>Our warfare is with <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, with immodesty, with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, with ambition; our trying and toilsome wrestling with carnal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, with the enticements of the world. The mind of man besieged, and on every hand invested with the onsets of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, scarcely meets the repeated attacks, scarcely resists them. If <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> is prostrated, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> springs up. If <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is overcome, ambition takes its place. If ambition is despised, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> exasperates, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> puffs up, wine-bibbing entices; <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> breaks concord; jealousy cuts friendship; you are constrained to curse, which the divine law forbids; you are compelled to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, which is not lawful. So many <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers daily, with so many risks is the heart wearied; and yet it delights to abide here long among the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> weapons, although it should rather be our craving and wish to hasten to Christ by the aid of a quicker death.</q>  Again, in the same treatise he says: <q>The blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> in his epistle lays it down, saying, 'To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain;' <span class="stiki" id="note152869"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;1:21</a></span> counting it the greatest gain no longer to be held by the snares of this world, no longer to be liable to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of the flesh.</q>  Moreover, on the Lord's Prayer, explaining what it is we ask when we say, <q>Hallowed be your name,</q> he says, among other matters: <q>For we have need of daily sanctification, that we, who daily fall away, may wash out our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by continual sanctification.</q>  Again, in the same treatise, when he would explain our saying, <q>Forgive us our debts,</q> he says: <q>And how necessarily, how providently and salutarily, are we admonished that we are sinners, since we are compelled to entreat for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and while pardon is asked for from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> recalls its own consciousness of guilt. Lest any one should flatter himself as being innocent, and by exalting himself should more deeply perish, he is instructed and taught that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> daily, in that he is bidden to entreat daily for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Thus, moreover, John also in his epistle warns us, and says: 'If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us. But if we confess our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He is faithful and just to forgive us our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.'</q>  Rightly, also, he proposed in his letter to Quirinus his own most absolute judgment on this subject, to which he subjoined the divine testimonies, <q>That no one is without filth and without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  There also he set down those testimonies by which original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is confirmed, which these men endeavour to twist into I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what new and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> meanings, whether what the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Job says, <q>No one is pure from filth, not one even if his life be of one day upon the earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152874"><a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse4">Job&nbsp;14:4-5</a></span> or what is read in the Psalm, <q>Behold, I was conceived in iniquity; and in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> has my mother nourished me in the womb.</q>  To which testimonies, on account of those also who are already <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in mature age, since even they are not without filth and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he added also that word of the most blessed John, which he often mentions in many other places besides, <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152876"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> and other passages of the same sentiment, which are asserted by all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, by way of opposing those <q>who deceive themselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in them.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 28.&mdash; Cyprian's Orthodoxy Undoubted.</h2>

<p>Let the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> say, if they dare, that this man of God was perverted by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the Manicheans, in so praising the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as yet to confess that no one in this life had attained to such a perfection of righteousness as to have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all, confirming his judgment by the clear <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and divine authority of the canonical testimonies. For does he deny that in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven, because he confesses that there remain frailty and infirmity, whence he says that we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and even to the end of this life, having unceasing conflict with the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of the flesh? Or did he not remember what the apostle said about the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without spot, that he prescribed that no one ought so to flatter himself in respect of a pure and spotless heart as to trust in his own innocence, and think that no medicine needed to be applied to his wounds? I think that these new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> may concede to this catholic man that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <q>that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> even in the old times aided good dispositions;</q> nay, even, what they themselves will not allow, that they could not have possessed good dispositions except through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. I think that Cyprian <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> or <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of any kind soever who pleased the Lord at any time were righteous&mdash; <q>not in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>,</q> as they <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> assert that we say, <q>but by the rule of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>,</q> as they boast that they say; although Cyprian says, nevertheless, no one can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and whoever should assert that he is blameless is either <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> or a fool. Nor is it with reference to anything else that he understands the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>Who shall boast that he has a pure heart? Or who shall boast that he is pure from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152877"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse9">Proverbs&nbsp;20:9</a></span> I think that Cyprian would not have needed to be taught by such as these, what he very well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, <q>that, in the time to come, there would be a reward of good works and a punishment of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works, but that no one could then perform the commands which here he might have despised;</q> and yet he does not understand and assert the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, who was assuredly not a contemner of the divine commands, to have said, <q>To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152878"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;2:21</a></span> on any other account, except that he reckoned it the greatest gain after this life no longer to be held in worldly entanglements, no longer to be obnoxious to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of the flesh. Therefore the most blessed Cyprian felt, and in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> saw, that even the life of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves, however good, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and righteous, suffered some involvements of worldly entanglements, was obnoxious to some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of the flesh; and that they desired death that they might be free from those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and that they might attain to that perfect righteousness which would not suffer such things, and which would no more have to be achieved in the way of command merely, but to be received in the way of reward. For not even when that shall have come for which we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> when we say, <q>Your kingdom come,</q> will there be in that kingdom of God no righteousness; since the apostle says, <q>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152879"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;14:17</a></span> Certainly these three things are commanded among other divine precepts.

But if they both shall be, and yet shall not be the same, assuredly here, in respect of the commandment of them, the doing is to be cared for&mdash;there the perfection is to be hoped for in the way of reward; when, not being withheld by any earthly entanglements, and being liable to no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of the flesh (on account of which the apostle, as Cyprian received this testimony, said that to die would be to him gain), we may perfectly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of whom will be face to face; we may also perfectly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our neighbour, since, when the thoughts of the heart are made manifest, no suspicion of any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can disturb any one concerning any one.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29 [XI.]&mdash; The Testimonies of Ambrose Against the Pelagians and First of All Concerning Original Sin.</h2>

<p>But now also to the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Cyprian, let me add, for the sake of more amply confuting these men, the most blessed Ambrose; because even Pelagius praised him so much as to say that in his writings could be found nothing to be blamed even by his enemies.  Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> say that there is no original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with which infants are born, and object to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the guilt of the Manichean <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, who withstand them on behalf of the most ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let this catholic man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Ambrose, praised even by Pelagius himself in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, answer them concerning this matter. When he was expounding the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah, he says: <q>Christ was, therefore, without spot, because He was not stained even in the usual condition itself of birth.</q>  And in another place in the same work, speaking of the Apostle Peter, he says: <q>He offered himself, which he thought before to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, asking for himself that not only his feet but his head also should be washed, because he had directly understood that by the washing of the feet, for those who fell in the first man, the filth of the obnoxious succession was abolished.</q>  Also in the same work he says: <q>It was preserved, therefore, that of a man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, that is, by that mingling of bodies, no one could be seen to be free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but He who is free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is free also from this kind of conception.</q> Also writing against the Novatians he says: <q>All of us men are born under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And our very origin is in corruption, as you have it read in the words of David,  'For lo, I was conceived in iniquities; and in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> has my mother brought me forth.'</q>  Also in the apology of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David, he says: <q>Before we are born we are spotted with contagion, and before the use of light we receive the mischief of that origin. We are conceived in iniquity.</q>  Also speaking of the Lord, he says: <q>It was certainly fitting that He who was not to have the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a bodily fall, should feel no natural contagion of generation. Rightly, therefore, David with weeping deplored in himself these defilements of nature, and the fact that the stain had begun in man before his life.</q>  Again, in the Ark of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> he says: <q>Therefore by one Lord Jesus the coming <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is declared to the nations; for He only could be righteous, although every generation should go astray, nor for any other reason than that, being born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, He was not at all bound by the ordinance of a guilty generation. 'Behold,' he says, 'I was conceived in iniquities; and in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> has my mother brought me forth;'  he who was esteemed righteous beyond others so speaks. Whom, then, should I now call righteous unless Him who is free from those chains, whom the bonds of our common nature do not hold fast?</q>  Behold, this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, most approved, even by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Pelagius, in the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, condemned the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> who deny original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with such evidence as this; and yet he does not with the Manicheans deny either God to be the Creator of those who are born, or condemn marriage, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ordained and blessed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30.&mdash; The Testimonies of Ambrose Concerning God's Grace.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> say that merit begins from man by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> repays the subsequent aid of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Let the venerable Ambrose here also refute them, when he says, in his exposition of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah, <q>that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> care without divine help is powerless for healing, and needs a divine helper.</q> Also, in the treatise which is inscribed, <q>On the Avoidance of the World,</q>  he says: <q>Our discourse is frequent on the avoidance of this world; and I wish that our disposition were as cautious and careful as our discourse is easy. But what is worse, the enticement of earthly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> frequently creeps in, and the flowing forth of vanities takes hold of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so that the very thing that you desire to avoid you think upon, and turn over in your mind; and this it is difficult for a man to beware of, but to get rid of it is impossible. Finally, that that is rather a matter to be wished than to be accomplished the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> testifies when he says, 'Incline my heart unto your testimonies, and not to <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>.'  For our heart and our thoughts are not in our power, seeing that they are suddenly forced forth and confuse the mind and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and draw them in other directions from those which you have proposed for them&mdash;they recall to things of time, they suggest worldly things, they obtrude voluptuous thoughts, they inweave seducing thoughts, and, in the very season in which we are proposing to lift up our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, vain thoughts are intruded upon us, and we are cast down for the most part to things of earth; and who is so <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> as always to rise upwards in his heart? And how can this be done without the divine help? Absolutely in no manner. Finally, of old <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says the same thing, 'Blessed is the man whose help is of You, O Lord; in his heart is going up.'</q>  What can be said more openly and more sufficiently? But lest the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> perchance should answer that, in that very point in which divine help is asked for, man's merit precedes, saying that that very thing is merit, that by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> he is desiring that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> should come to his assistance, let them give heed to what the same <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man says in his exposition of Isaiah. He says: <q>And to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> God is a spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for no man says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Lord, except in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152895"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:13</a></span> Whence also, expounding the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke,  he says: <q>You see certainly that everywhere the power of the Lord cooperates with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> desires, so that no man can build without the Lord, no man can undertake anything without the Lord.</q> Because such a man as Ambrose says this, and commends God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as it is fitting for a son of promise to do, with grateful <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, does he therefore destroy <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>? Or does he mean <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to be understood as the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> in their different discourses will have to appear nothing but law&mdash; so that, for instance, God may be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to help us not to do what we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what we may do? If they think that such a man of God as this is of this <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, let them hear what he has said about the law itself. In the book <q>On the Avoidance of the World,</q> he says: <q>The law could stop the mouth of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; it could not convert their mind.</q>  In another place also, in the same treatise, he says: <q>The law condemns the deed; it does not take away its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q>  Let them see that this faithful and catholic man agrees with the apostle who says, <q>Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that what things soever the law says, it says to those who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Because by the law no flesh shall be justified in His sight.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152899"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;3:19-20</a></span> For from that apostolic opinion Ambrose took and wrote these things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31.&mdash; The Testimonies of Ambrose on the Imperfection of Present Righteousness.</h2>

<p>But now, since the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> say that there either are or have been righteous men in this life who have lived without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to such an extent that the future life which is to be hoped for as a reward cannot be more advanced or more perfect, let Ambrose here also answer them and refute them. For, expounding Isaiah the Prophet in reference to what is written, <q>I have begotten and brought up children, and they have despised me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152900"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;1:2</a></span> he undertook to dispute concerning the generations which are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in that argument he quoted the testimony of John when he says, <q>He that is born of God <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152901"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:9</a></span> And, treating the same very difficult question, he says: <q>Since in this world there is none who is free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; since John himself says, 'If we say that we have not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, we make Him a liar.' <span class="stiki" id="note152902"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:10</a></span> But if 'they that are born of God <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not,' and if these words refer to those of them who are in the world, it is necessary that we should regard them as those numberless people who have obtained God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by the regeneration of the laver. But yet, when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, 'All things are waiting upon You, that You may give them meat in season. That You give them they gather for themselves; when You open Your hand, all things shall be filled with goodness. But when You turn away Your face, they shall be troubled: You shall take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall be turned into their dust. You shall send forth Your Spirit, and they shall be created: and You shall renew the face of the earth,'  such things as these cannot seem to have been said of any time whatever but of that future time, in which there shall be a new earth and a new heaven. Therefore they shall be disturbed that they may take their beginning. 'And when You open Your hand all things shall be filled with goodness,' which is not easily characteristic of this age. For concerning this age what does Scripture say? 'There is none that does good, no, not one.'  If, therefore, there are different generations&mdash;and here the very entrance into this life is the receiver of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to such an extent that even he who begot should be despised; while another generation does not receive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash;let us consider whether by any means there may not be a regeneration for us after the course of this life&mdash;of which regeneration it is said, 'In the regeneration when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall sit in the throne of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note152905"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;19:28</a></span> For as that is called the regeneration of washing whereby we are renewed from the filth of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> washed away, so that seems to be called a regeneration by which we are purified from every stain of bodily materiality, and are regenerated in the pure sense of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; so that every quality of regeneration may be purer than of that washing, so that no suspicion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can fall either on a man's doings, or even on his very thoughts themselves.</q> Moreover, in another place in the same work he says: <q>We see it to be impossible that any person created in a body can be absolutely spotless, since even <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says that he is imperfect. For thus he has it: 'Not that I have already received, or am already perfect.' <span class="stiki" id="note152906"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse12">Philippians&nbsp;3:12</a></span> and yet after a little he says, 'As many of us, therefore, as are perfect.' <span class="stiki" id="note152907"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> Unless, perchance, there is one perfection in this world, another after this is completed, of which he says to the Corinthians, 'When that which is perfect has come;' <span class="stiki" id="note152908"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:10</a></span> and elsewhere, 'Till we all come into the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, into the perfect man to the measure of the age of the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note152909"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> As, then, the apostle says that many are placed in this world who are perfect along with him, but who, if you have regard to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> perfection, could not be perfect, since he says, 'We see now through a mirror, enigmatically; but then face to face: now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part; but then I shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even as also I am <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>:' <span class="stiki" id="note152910"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> so also there both are those who are 'spotless' in this world, and will be those who are 'spotless' in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, although certainly, if you consider it accurately, no person can be spotless, because no person is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> Also in the same he says: <q>We see that, while we live in this life, we ought to purify ourselves and to seek <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and to begin from the purification of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and as it were to establish the foundations of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so that we may deserve to attain the perfection of our purgation after this life.</q> And again, in the same he says: <q>But laden and groaning, who does not say, 'O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?' <span class="stiki" id="note152911"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24</a></span> So with the same teacher we give all varieties of interpretation. For if he is unhappy who recognises himself as involved in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the body, certainly everybody is unhappy; for I should not call that man <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who, being confused with any darkness of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his own condition. That, moreover, has not absurdly come to be understood; for if a man who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself is unhappy, assuredly all are wretched, because every one either recognises his weakness by wisdom, or by folly is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it.</q> Moreover, in the treatise <q>On the Benefit of Death,</q> he says:  <q>Let death work in us, in order that that may work life also, a good life after death&mdash;that is, a good life after victory, a good life after the contest is finished; so that now no longer the law of the flesh may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to resist the law of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that no longer we may have any contention with the body of death.</q> Again, in the same treatise he says: <q>Therefore, because the righteous have this reward, that they see the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that light which lightens every man, let us henceforth put on the desire of this kind of reward, that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may draw near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> may draw near to Him, our desire may cleave to Him, that we be not separated from Him. And placed here as we are, let us by meditating, by reading, by seeking, be united with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him as we can. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him in part here; because here all things are imperfect, there all are perfect; here we are infants, there we shall be strong men. 'We see,' says he, 'now through a mirror in an enigma, but then face to face.' Then, His face being revealed, we shall be allowed to look upon the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which now our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, involved in the compacted dregs of this body, and shadowed by some stains and filth of this flesh, cannot clearly see. 'For who,' He says, 'shall see my face and live?' and rightly. For if our eyes cannot bear the rays of the sun&mdash;and if any one should gaze too long on the region of the sun he is said to be blinded&mdash;if a creature cannot look upon a creature without deceit and offense, how can he without his own peril look upon the glittering face of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Creator, covered as he is with the clothing of this body? For who is justified in God's sight, when even the infant of one day cannot be pure from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and no one can boast of his integrity and pureness of heart?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 32 [XII.]&mdash; The Pelagian's Heresy Arose Long After Ambrose.</h2>

<p>It would be too long if I were to seek to mention everything which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Ambrose said and wrote against this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, which was to arise so long afterwards; not indeed with a view to answer them, but with a view to declare the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to build up men in it. Moreover, I neither could nor ought to mention all those things which Cyprian, most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, wrote in his letters, whereby it is shown how this which we hold is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as it was delivered of old by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, and so retained and kept by our fathers and even to this time, in which these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have attempted to destroy it, and as it will hereafter by God's good will be retained and kept. For that these things and things of this kind were thus delivered to Cyprian, and by Cyprian, is testified by the testimonies produced from his letters; and that thus they were maintained up to our times is shown by these things which Ambrose wrote about these matters before these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> had begun to rage, and catholic ears had shuddered at their profane novelties which are everywhere; and that thus, moreover, they shall be maintained hereafter, was declared with sufficient vigour partly by the condemnation of such opinions as these, partly by their correction. For whatever they may dare to mutter against the sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Cyprian and Ambrose, I do not think that they will break out into such a <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> as to dare to call those noted and memorable men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Manicheans.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33.&mdash; Opposition of the Manichean and Catholic Dogmas.</h2>

<p>What is it, then, which in their raging blindness of mind they are now spreading about,  <q>that almost throughout the entire West a dogma not less foolish than impious is taken up;</q> when by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and by His merciful governance of His Church, the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has been so watchful that the dogma, <q>not less foolish than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>,</q> as of the Manicheans, so also of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, should not be taken up? So <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and learned catholic men, such as are attested to be so by the report of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, praise both God's creation, and marriage as ordained by Him, and the law given by Him by means of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> implanted into man's nature, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, with due and fitting proclamation; all which five things the Manicheans condemn, partly by denying, and partly also by abominating. Whence it appears that these catholic doctors were far removed from the notions of the Manicheans, and yet they assert original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; they assert God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> above <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, as antecedent to all merit, so as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to afford a gratuitous divine assistance; they assert that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> lived righteously in this flesh, in such wise that the help of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was necessary to them, by which their daily <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> might be forgiven; and that a perfected righteousness which could not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be in another life the reward of those who should live righteously here.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34.&mdash; The Calling Together of a Synod Not Always Necessary to the Condemnation of Heresies.</h2>

<p>What is it, then, that they say, that <q>subscription was extorted from simple <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sitting in their places without any Synodal congregation</q>? Was subscription extorted against such <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as these from the most blessed and excellent men in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, Cyprian and Ambrose, before such <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as these were in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>?&mdash; seeing that they overthrow their impious <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> with such clearness that we can scarcely find anything more manifest to say against them. Or, indeed, was there any need of the congregation of a Synod to condemn this open pest, as if no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> could at any time be condemned except by a Synodal congregation?&mdash; when, on the contrary, very few <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> can be found for the sake of condemning which any such necessity has arisen; and those have been many and incomparably more which have deserved to be accused and condemned in the place where they arose, and thence could be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and avoided over the rest of the lands. But the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of such as these, which lifts itself up so much against God as not to be willing to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in Him but rather in <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, is understood as grasping also at this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that a Synod of the East and West should be gathered together on their account. In fact, they endeavour, forsooth, to disturb the catholic world, because, the Lord being against them, they are unable to pervert it; when rather they ought to have been trodden out wherever those wolves might have appeared, by watchfulness and pastoral diligence, after a competent and sufficient judgment made concerning them; whether with a view of their being healed and changed, or with a view of their being shunned by the safety and soundness of others, by the help of the Shepherd of the sheep, who seeks the lost sheep also among the little ones, who makes the sheep <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and righteous freely; who both providently instructs them, although sanctified and justified, yet in their frailty and infirmity to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for a daily remission for their daily <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, without which no one lives in this world, even although he may live well; and mercifully listens to their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.</p>
