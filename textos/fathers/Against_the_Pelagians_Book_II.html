<h1>Against the Pelagians (Book II)</h1>

<p>This book can hardly be said to form part of a dialogue. It is rather an argument from Scripture to prove the point of the Augustinian arguer, Atticus. From the fourth chapter onwards it consists, like the last five chapters of Book I., of a chain of Scripture texts, taken from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and the Prophets, to show the universality of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and thus to refute the Pelagian assertion that a man can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he wills. We shall, therefore, give, as in the previous case, a list of the texts and the first words of them, only giving Jerome's words where he introduces some original remark of his own, or some noteworthy comment.</p>

<p>The Pelagian begins by reiterating the dilemma: If the commandments are given to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, then man can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; if he is, by his creation, such that he must be a sinner, then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not he, is the author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. To the argument that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are enjoined for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, he replies by appealing from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> to the New, which leads to a discussion (2, 3) on <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> description of the conflict with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in <a href="../bible/rom007.htm">Romans 7</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, it is argued, speaks not as a sinner, but as a <em>man</em>, and thus confesses the sinfulness of humanity. That men may be without ingrained <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is possible; that they can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not. This leads the Augustinian, Atticus, resuming his list of testimonies, to the fact that, though men are found who are righteous as avoiding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>), yet none is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x1F71;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>).</p>

<p>In <a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse5">Psalm xxxii. 5</a>. One who speaks of himself as <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q> yet confesses his transgression.</p>

<p>6. There are four emotions which agitate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, two relating to the present, two to the future; two to good, and two to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. There is sorrow, called in Greek <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F7B;&#x03C0;&#x03B7;</span>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, in Greek <span class="greek">&#x03C7;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x1F71;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1F21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x1F75;</span>, although many translate the latter word by <em>voluptas</em>, pleasure; the one of which is referred to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the other to good. And we go too far if we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over such things as we ought not, as, for example, riches, power, distinctions, the bad fortune of enemies, or their death; or, on the other hand, if we are tortured with grief on account of present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, adversity, exile, poverty, weakness, and the death of kindred, all of which is forbidden by the Apostle. And again, if we <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> those things which we consider good, inheritance, distinctions, unvaried prosperity, bodily health, and the like, in the possession of which we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and find enjoyment; or if we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> those things which we deem adverse. Now, according to the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, Zeno that is to say and Chrysippus, it is possible for a perfect man to be free from these emotions; according to the Peripatetics, it is difficult and even impossible, an opinion which has the constant support of all Scripture. Hence <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, the historian of the Maccabees, said that the emotions can be subdued and governed, not extirpated, and Cicero's five books of <q>Tusculan Disputations</q> are full of these discussions. <span class="stiki" id="note305258"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> According to the Apostle, the weakness of the body and spiritual hosts of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in the heavenly places fight against us. And the same writer <span class="stiki" id="note305259"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;5:19</a></span> tells us that the works of the flesh and the works of the spirit are manifest, and these are contrary the one to the other, so that we do not the things that we would. If we do not what we would, but what we would not, how can you say that a man can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he chooses? You see that neither an Apostle, nor any believer can perform what he wishes. <span class="stiki" id="note305260"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:8</a></span> <q>Love covers a multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> not so much <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the past as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the present, that we may not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> any more while the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God abides in us. Wherefore it is said concerning the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that was a sinner, <span class="stiki" id="note305261"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;7:47</a></span> <q>Her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are many are forgiven her, for she loved much.</q> And this shows us that the doing what we wish does not depend merely upon our own power, but upon the assistance which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His mercy gives to our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.</p>

<p>7. The quotations from Scripture are now continued:</p>

<p>In <!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->1 John 1:5, John 1:7, 8, Matthew 5:14, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> are called the Light of the world. The world therefore is darkness.</p>

The sons of Zadok, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the spiritual temple, that is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, go not out to the people in their ministerial robes, lest by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> intercourse they may lose their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and be defiled. And do you suppose that you, in the thick of the throng, and an ordinary individual, are pure?</p>

<p>26. Let us hastily run through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah:</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Jeremiah 5:1, 2. Is there any that does <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, etc.</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->vii. 21, 22. God rejects the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, because of the worshippers' <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lives.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/jer013.htm#verse23">xiii. 23</a>. Can the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> change his skin?</p>

<p>27.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse14">Jerem. xvii. 14</a>. <q>Heal me, O Lord.</q> Otherwise Jeremiah could only say, as in the text next quoted,</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->xx. 14, 17, 18. Cursed be the day wherein I was born, etc.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse23">xxiii. 23</a>. Am I a God at hand, etc. So conscious is he of God's power.</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->xxiv. 6, 7. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not they themselves, will plant them, etc.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/jer026.htm#verse21">xxvi. 21-24</a>. Jeremiah needed the help of Ahikam. How much more do we need that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>28.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse34">Jerem. xxxi. 34</a>. The promise of the new covenant.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/jer032.htm#verse30">xxxii. 30</a>. The children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> have perpetually done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->xxxvii. 18, 19. Yet Jeremiah himself trembled before Zedekiah.</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Jeremiah 30:10, 11. Fear not, O Jacob, for <em>I am with you.</em></p>

<p>29.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/amo006.htm#verse14">Amos vi. 14</a>. <q>We have taken us horns by our own strength.</q> These are the boasts of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But</p>

<p><a href="../bible/isa016.htm#verse6">Is. xvi. 6</a>. His strength (Moab's) is by no means according to his arrogance. </p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Jeremiah 1:7, 20. Men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will only be abolished because God is gracious to them. If you will abandon your assertions of natural ability, I will concede that your whole contention stands good, but only by the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/lam003.htm#verse26">Lam. iii. 26-42</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that a man should quietly wait for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the Lord.</p>

<p>30.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse17">Dan. iv. 17</a>. The Most High rules in the kingdom of men.</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Psalm 113:7, 8. He raises up the poor out of the dust.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse17">Is. xl. 17</a>. He does what He will in heaven and in earth.</p>

<p>The words of <a href="../bible/2ma005.htm#verse17">2 Maccabees v. 17</a>, which say that Antiochus Epiphanes had power to overthrow the Temple, <q>because of the multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> are quoted in connection with the confessions of Daniel.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse5">Dan. ix. 5</a>. <q>We have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and dealt perversely,</q> which is shown by</p>

<p><a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse20">20</a>. <q>While I was yet <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>,</q> etc., to be a personal, not only a national confession.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse24">24</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the seventy weeks shows that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> looked to God alone for the establishment of righteousness.</p>

<p>So then, until that end shall come, and this corruptible and mortal shall put on incorruption and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, we must be liable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; not, as you <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> say, owing to the fault of our nature and creation, but through the frailty and fickleness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, which varies from moment to moment; because God alone changes not. You ask in what respects Abel, <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, Joshua the son of Nun, or Elisha, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. There is no need to look for a knot in a bulrush; I freely confess I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; and I only wish that, when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are manifest, I might still be silent. <span class="stiki" id="note305278"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing against myself,</q> says St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>yet am I not hereby justified.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note305279"><a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;16:7</a></span> <q>Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.</q> Before Him no man is justified.
