<h1>Against the Sabellians</h1>

<p></p>

<p>1. Now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> it would be just to dispute against those who, by dividing and rending the monarchy, which is the most august announcement of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, into, as it were, three powers, and distinct substances (<em>hypostases</em>), and three deities, destroy it.  For I have heard that some who preach and teach the word of God among you are teachers of this opinion, who indeed diametrically, so to speak, are opposed to the opinion of Sabellius. For he blasphemes in saying that the Son Himself is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> versa; but these in a certain manner announce three gods, in that they divide the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> unity into three different substances, absolutely separated from one another. For it is essential that the Divine Word should be united to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, and that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> should abide and dwell in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and thus that the Divine Trinity should be reduced and gathered into one, as if into a certain head&mdash; that is, into the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> God of all. For the doctrine of the foolish <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, which cuts and divides the monarchy into three elements, is assuredly of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and is not of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, or of those to whom the Saviour's teaching is agreeable. For these indeed rightly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Trinity is declared in the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>, but that the doctrine that there are three gods is neither taught in the Old nor in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.</p>

<p>2. But neither are they less to be blamed who think that the Son was a creation, and decided that the Lord was made just as one of those things which really were made; whereas the divine declarations testify that He was begotten, as is fitting and proper, but not that He was created or made. It is therefore not a trifling, but a very great impiety, to say that the Lord was in any wise made with hands. For if the Son was made, there was a time when He was not; but He always was, if, as He Himself declares,  He is undoubtedly in the Father. And if Christ is the Word, the Wisdom, and the Power,&mdash; for the divine writings tell us that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is these, as you yourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>&mdash;assuredly these are powers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore, if the Son was made, there was a time when these were not in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>;  and thus there was a time when God was without these things, which is utterly absurd. But why should I discourse at greater length to you about these matters, since you are men filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and especially understanding what absurd results follow from the opinion which asserts that the Son was made? The leaders of this view seem to me to have given very little heed to these things, and for that reason to have strayed absolutely, by explaining the passage otherwise than as the divine and prophetic Scripture demands. <q>The Lord created me the beginning of His ways.</q>  For, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, there is more than one signification of the word <q>created;</q> and in this place <q>created</q> is the same as <q>set over</q> the works made by Himself&mdash; made, I say, by the Son Himself. But this <q>created</q> is not to be understood in the same manner as <q>made.</q> For to make and to create are different from one another. <q>Is not He Himself your Father, that has possessed you and created you?</q>  says <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the great song of Deuteronomy. And thus might any one reasonably convict these men. Oh reckless and rash men! Was then <q>the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature</q>  something made?&mdash; <q>He who was begotten from the womb before the morning star?</q> &mdash; He who in the person of Wisdom says, <q>Before all the hills He begot me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072349"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse25">Proverbs&nbsp;8:25</a></span> Finally, any one may read in many parts of the divine utterances that the Son is said to have been begotten, but never that He was made. From which considerations, they who dare to say that His divine and inexplicable generation was a creation, are openly convicted of thinking that which is false concerning the generation of the Lord.</p>

<p>3. That admirable and divine unity, therefore, must neither be separated into three divinities, nor must the dignity and eminent greatness of the Lord be diminished by <span style="italic">having applied to it</span> the name of creation, but we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Omnipotent, and on Christ Jesus His Son, and on the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Moreover, that the Word is united to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, because He says, <q>I and the Father are one;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072350"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> and, <q>I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father is in Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072351"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;14:10</a></span> Thus doubtless will be maintained in its integrity <span style="italic">the doctrine of</span> the divine Trinity, and the sacred announcement of the monarchy.</p>
