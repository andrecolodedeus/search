<h1>An Answer to the Jews</h1>


<h2>Chapter 1. Occasion of Writing. Relative Position of Jews and Gentiles Illustrated.</h2>

<p>It happened very recently a dispute was held between a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and a Jewish <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselyte</a>. Alternately with contentious cable they each spun out the day until evening. By the opposing din, moreover, of some partisans of the individuals, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> began to be overcast by a sort of cloud. It was therefore our pleasure that that which, owing to the confused noise of disputation, could be less fully elucidated point by point, should be more carefully looked into, and that the pen should determine, for reading purposes, the questions handled.</p>

<p>For the occasion, indeed, of claiming <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> even for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> derived a pre-eminent fitness from this fact, that the man who set up to vindicate God's Law as his own was of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and not a Jew <q>of the stock of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031127"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse5">Philippians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> For this fact&mdash; that <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are admissible to God's Law&mdash; is enough to prevent <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from priding himself on the notion that <q>the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are accounted as a little drop of a bucket,</q> or else as <q>dust out of a threshing-floor:</q>  although we have God Himself as an adequate engager and faithful promiser, in that He promised to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> that <q>in his seed should be blest all nations of the earth;</q>  and that  out of the womb of Rebecca <q>two peoples and two nations were about to proceed,</q> &mdash; of course those of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that is, of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that is ours. Each, then, was called a <em>people</em> and a <em>nation</em>; lest, from the nuncupative appellation, any should dare to claim for himself the privilege of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For God ordained <q>two peoples and two nations</q> as about to proceed out of the womb of one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: nor did <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>  make distinction in the nuncupative appellation, but in the order of birth; to the effect that, which ever was to be prior in proceeding from the womb, should be subjected to <q>the less,</q> that is, the posterior. For thus unto Rebecca did God speak: <q>Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples shall be divided from your bowels; and people shall overcome people, and the greater shall serve the less.</q>  Accordingly, since the <em>people</em> or <em>nation</em> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> is anterior in time, and <q>greater</q> through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of primary favour in the Law, whereas ours is understood to be <q>less</q> in the age of times, as having in the last era of the world  attained the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divine mercy: beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, through the edict of the divine utterance, the <em>prior</em> and <q>greater</q> people&mdash; that is, the Jewish&mdash; must necessarily serve the <q>less;</q> and the <q>less</q> people&mdash; that is, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>&mdash; overcome the <q>greater.</q> For, withal, according to the memorial records of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, the <em>people</em> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>&mdash; that is, the more ancient&mdash; quite forsook <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and did degrading service to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and, abandoning the Divinity, was surrendered to images; while <q>the people</q> said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, <q>Make us gods to go before us.</q>  And when the gold out of the necklaces of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and the rings of the men had been wholly smelted by fire, and there had come forth a calf-like head, to this figment <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with one consent (abandoning God) gave <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, saying, <q>These are the gods who brought us from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q>  For thus, in the later times in which kings were governing them, did they again, in conjunction with <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, worship golden cattle, and groves, and enslave themselves to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>.  Whence is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that they have ever been depicted, out of the volume of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, as guilty of the crime of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; whereas our <q>less</q>&mdash; that is, posterior&mdash; <em>people</em>, quitting the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> which formerly it used slavishly to serve, has been converted to the same God from whom <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as we have above related, had departed. <span class="stiki" id="note031138"><a href="../bible/1th001.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;1:9-10</a></span> For thus has the <q>less</q>&mdash; that is, posterior&mdash; <em>people</em> overcome the <q>greater people,</q> while it attains the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of divine favour, from which <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has been <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The Law Anterior to Moses.</h2>

<p>Stand we, therefore, foot to foot, and determine we the sum and substance of the actual question within definite lists.</p>

<p>For why should <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the Governor of the whole world,  the Fashioner of humanity, the Sower  of universal nations be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have given a law through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to one people, and not be said to have assigned it to all nations? For unless He had given it to all by no means would He have <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> permitted even proselytes out of the nations to have access to it. But&mdash; as is congruous with the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with His equity, as the Fashioner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>&mdash; He gave to all nations the selfsame law, which at definite and stated times He enjoined should be observed, when He willed, and through whom He willed, and as He willed. For in the beginning of the world He gave to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> himself and Eve a law, that they were not to eat of the fruit of the tree planted in the midst of paradise; but that, if they did contrariwise, by death they were to die.  Which law had continued enough for them, had it been kept. For in this law given to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> we recognise in embryo  all the precepts which afterwards sprouted forth when given through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; that is, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God from your whole heart and out of your whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself;  You shall not kill; You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; You shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>; False <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> you shall not utter; Honour your father and mother; and, That which is another's, shall you not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>. For the primordial law was given to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> in paradise, as the womb of all the precepts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In short, if they had loved the Lord their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they would not have contravened His precept; if they had <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> loved their neighbour&mdash; that is, themselves &mdash; they would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the persuasion of the serpent, and thus would not have committed <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> upon themselves,  by falling  from <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, by contravening God's precept; from theft also they would have abstained, if they had not stealthily tasted of the fruit of the tree, nor had been anxious to skulk beneath a tree to escape the view of the Lord their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor would they have been made partners with the falsehood-asseverating <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, by believing him that they would be <q>like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and thus they would not have offended God either, as their Father, who had fashioned them from clay of the earth, as out of the womb of a mother; if they had not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> another's, they would not have tasted of the unlawful fruit.</p>

<p>Therefore, in this general and primordial law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the observance of which, in the case of the tree's fruit, He had sanctioned, we recognise <em>en</em>closed all the precepts specially of the posterior Law, which germinated when <em>dis</em>closed at their proper times. For the subsequent superinduction of a law is the work of the same Being who had before premised a precept; since it is His province withal subsequently to train, who had before resolved to form, righteous creatures. For what wonder if He extends a discipline who institutes it? If He advances who begins? In short, before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a>,  written in stone-tables, I contend that there was a law unwritten, which was <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> understood naturally, and by the fathers was <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> kept. For whence was <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> <q>found righteous,</q>  if in his case the righteousness of a natural law had not preceded? Whence was <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> accounted <q>a friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  if not on the ground of equity and righteousness, (in the observance) of a natural law? Whence was <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a> named <q><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  if, before the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to God? For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was the Law given to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, at that (well-known) time after their exode from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, after the interval and spaces of four hundred years. In fact, it was after <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> <q>four hundred and thirty years</q>  that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God's law was anterior even to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, but was more ancient; (existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> too and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, has reformed for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as <q>the law was given through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note031152"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;1:17</a></span> at a definite time, so it should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not annul this power which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has, which reforms the law's precepts answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. In fine, let him who contends that the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> is still to be observed as a balm of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, or practised <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and were thus rendered <q>friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For if <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his sinning, if <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> purges? At all events, in settling him in paradise, He appointed one uncircumcised as colonist of paradise. Therefore, since God originated Adam uncircumcised, and inobservant of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, consequently his offspring also, Abel, offering Him <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, uncircumcised and inobservant of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, was by Him commended; while He accepted  what he was offering in simplicity of heart, and reprobated the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of his brother Cain, who was not rightly dividing what he was offering.  <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> also, uncircumcised&mdash; yes, and inobservant of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>&mdash; God freed from the deluge.  For <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, too, most righteous man, uncircumcised and inobservant of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, He translated from this world;  who did not first taste  death, in order that, being a candidate for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life,  he might by this time show us that we also may, without the burden of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, please God. <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a> also, <q>the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> uncircumcised and inobservant of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, was chosen to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, withal, the brother  of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, proves that it was for the merits of righteousness, without observance of the law, that he was freed from the conflagration of the Sodomites. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Of Circumcision and the Supercession of the Old Law.</h2>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, (you say,) was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>. Yes, but he pleased God before his <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>;  nor yet did he observe the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. For he had <q>accepted</q>  <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; but such as was to be for <q>a sign</q> of that time, not for a prerogative title to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. In fact, subsequent patriarchs were uncircumcised, like <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>, who, uncircumcised, offered to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself, already <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, on his return from battle, bread and wine.  <q>But again,</q> (you say) the son of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> would upon one occasion have been choked by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, if Zipporah,  had not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the foreskin of the infant with a pebble; whence, <q>there is the greatest peril if any fail to circumcise the foreskin of his flesh.</q> Nay, but if <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> altogether brought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, even <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself, in the case of his own son, would not have omitted to circumcise him on the eighth day; whereas it is agreed that Zipporah did it on the journey, at the compulsion of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Consider we, accordingly, that one single infant's compulsory <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> cannot have prescribed to every people, and founded, as it were, a law for keeping this precept. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, foreseeing that He was about to give this <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> to the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for <q>a sign,</q> not for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, urges the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the son of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, their future leader, for this reason; that, since He had begun, through him, to give the People the precept of circumcision,  the people should not despise it, from seeing this example (of neglect) already exhibited conspicuously in their leader's son. For <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> had to be given; but as <q>a sign,</q> whence <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the last time would have to be distinguished, when, in accordance with their deserts, they should be prohibited from entering the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city, as we see through the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, saying, <q>Your land is desert; your cities utterly burnt with fire; your country, in your sight, strangers shall eat up; and, deserted and subverted by strange peoples, the daughter of Zion shall be derelict, like a shed in a vineyard, and like a watchhouse in a cucumber-field, and as it were a city which is being stormed.</q>  Why so? Because the subsequent discourse of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> reproaches them, saying, <q>Sons have I begotten and upraised, but they have reprobated me;</q>  and again, <q>And if you shall have outstretched hands, I will avert my face from you; and if you shall have multiplied <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, I will not hear you: for your hands are full of blood;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031168"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;1:15</a></span> and again, <q>Woe! sinful nation; a people full of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> sons; you have quite forsaken <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have provoked unto indignation the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031169"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;1:4</a></span> This, therefore, was God's foresight&mdash;that of giving <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, for a sign whence they might be distinguished when the time should arrive wherein their above-mentioned deserts should prohibit their admission into Jerusalem: which circumstance, because it was to be, used to be announced; and, because we see it accomplished, is recognised by us. For, as the carnal <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which was temporary, was in wrought for <q>a sign</q> in a contumacious people, so the spiritual has been given for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to an <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> people; while the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah says, <q>Make a renewal for you, and sow not in thorns; be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and circumcise the foreskin of your heart:</q>  and in another place he says, <q>Behold, days shall come, says the Lord, and I will draw up, for the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a> and for the house of Jacob,  a new testament; not such as I once gave their fathers in the day wherein I led them out from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q>  Whence we understand that the coming cessation of the former <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> then given, and the coming procession of a new law (not such as He had already given to the fathers), are announced: just as Isaiah foretold, saying that in the last days the mount of the Lord and the house of God were to be manifest above the tops of the mounts: <q>And it shall be exalted,</q> he says, <q>above the hills; and there shall come over it all nations; and many shall walk, and say, Come, ascend we unto the mount of the Lord, and unto the house of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <em>Jacob</em>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031173"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;2:2-3</a></span> &mdash; not of <em><a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a></em>, the former son, but of <em>Jacob</em>, the second; that is, of <em>our</em> <q>people,</q> whose <q>mount</q> is Christ, <q>pr&aelig;cised without concisors' hands,  filling every land,</q> shown in the book of Daniel.  In short, the coming procession of a new law out of this <q>house of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob</q> Isaiah in the ensuing words announces, saying, <q>For from Zion shall go out a law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem, and shall judge among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>,</q>&mdash; that is, among <em>us</em>, who have been called out of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>&mdash;<q>and they shall join to beat their glaives into ploughs, and their lances into sickles; and nations shall not take up glaive against nation, and they shall no more learn to fight.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031176"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;2:3-4</a></span> Who else, therefore, are understood but <em>we</em>, who, fully taught by the new law, observe these practices&mdash;the old law being obliterated, the coming of whose abolition the action itself  demonstrates? For the wont of the old law was to avenge itself by the vengeance of the glaive, and to pluck out <q>eye for eye,</q> and to inflict retaliatory revenge for injury.  But the new law's wont was to point to clemency, and to convert to tranquillity the pristine ferocity of <q>glaives</q> and <q>lances,</q> and to remodel the pristine execution of <q><a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a></q> upon the rivals and foes of the law into the pacific actions of <q>ploughing</q> and <q>tilling</q> the land.  Therefore as we have shown above that the coming cessation of the old law and of the carnal <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was declared, so, too, the observance of the new law and the spiritual <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> has shone out into the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> obediences  of peace. For <q>a people,</q> he says, <q>whom I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not has served me; in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of the ear it has <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> me.</q>  Prophets made the announcement. But what is the <q>people</q> which was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <em>ours</em>, who in days bygone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not God? And who, in the hearing of the ear, gave heed to Him, but <em>we</em>, who, forsaking <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, have been converted to God? For <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>&mdash; who <em>had</em> been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who had by Him been <q>upraised</q>  in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and was transported through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, and who in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, fed forty years with manna, was wrought to the semblance of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and not contaminated with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>,  or fed on this world's  meats, but fed on <q><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> loaves</q> &mdash; the manna&mdash; and sufficiently bound to God by His benefits&mdash; forgot his Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: <q>Make us gods, to go before us: for that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who ejected us from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, has quite forsaken us; and what has befallen him we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not.</q> And accordingly we, who <q>were not the people of God</q> in days bygone, have been made His people,  by accepting the new law above mentioned, and the new <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> before foretold.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Of the Observance of the Sabbath.</h2>

<p>It follows, accordingly, that, in so far as the abolition of carnal <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and of the old law is demonstrated as having been consummated at its specific times, so also the observance of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> is demonstrated to have been temporary.</p>

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say, that from the beginning God sanctified the seventh day, by resting on it from all His works which He made; and that thence it was, likewise, that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to the People: <q>Remember the day of the sabbaths, to sanctify it: every servile work you shall not do therein, except what pertains unto life.</q>  Whence we (<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>) understand that <em>we</em> still more ought to observe a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> from all <q>servile work</q>  always, and not only every seventh day, but through all time. And through this arises the question for us, <em>what</em> <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> God willed us to keep? For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> point to a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> temporal. For Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q> <em>Your</em> sabbaths my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031189"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;1:13</a></span> and in another place he says, <q> <em>My</em> sabbaths you have profaned.</q>  Whence we discern that the temporal <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> is accounted divine; concerning which He predicts through Isaiah: <q>And there shall be,</q> He says, <q>month after month, and day after day, and <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> after <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>; and all flesh shall come to adore in Jerusalem, says the Lord;</q>  which we understand to have been fulfilled in the times of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when <q>all flesh</q>&mdash; that is, every nation&mdash; <q>came to adore in Jerusalem</q> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> His Son, as was predicted through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Behold, proselytes through me shall go unto You.</q>  Thus, therefore, before this temporal <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, there was withal an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> foreshown and foretold; just as before the carnal <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> there was withal a spiritual <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> foreshown. In short, let them teach us, as we have already premised, that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> observed the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>; or that Abel, when offering to God a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> victim, pleased Him by a religious reverence for the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>; or that <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, when translated, had been a keeper of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>; or that <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> the ark-builder observed, on account of the deluge, an immense <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>; or that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, in observance of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, offered Isaac his son; or that <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a> in his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> received the law of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>.</p>

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are sure to say, that ever since this precept was given through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the observance has been binding. Manifest accordingly it is, that the precept was not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> nor spiritual, but temporary,  which would one day cease. In short, so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is it that it is not in the exemption from work of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>&mdash; that is, of the seventh day&mdash; that the celebration of this <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> is to consist, that Joshua the son of Nun, at the time that he was reducing the city <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, stated that he had received from God a precept to order the People that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should carry the ark of the testament of God seven days, making the circuit of the city; and thus, when the seventh day's circuit had been performed, the walls of the city would spontaneously fall. <span class="stiki" id="note031194"><a href="../bible/jos006.htm#verse1">Joshua&nbsp;6:1-20</a></span> Which was so done; and when the space of the seventh day was finished, just as was predicted, down fell the walls of the city. Whence it is manifestly shown, that in the number of the seven days there intervened a sabbath-day. For seven days, whencesoever they may have commenced, must necessarily include within them a sabbath-day; on which day not only must the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have worked, but the city must have been made a prey by the edge of the sword by all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Nor is it doubtful that they <q>wrought servile work,</q> when, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to God's precept, they drove the preys of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. For in the times of the Maccabees, too, they did bravely in fighting on the sabbaths, and routed their foreign foes, and recalled the law of their fathers to the primitive style of life by fighting on the sabbaths.  Nor should I think it was any other law which they thus vindicated, than the one in which they remembered the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the prescript touching <q>the day of the sabbaths.</q> </p>

<p>Whence it is manifest that the force of such precepts was temporary, and respected the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of present circumstances; and that it was not with a view to its observance in perpetuity that God formerly gave them such a law.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Of Sacrifices.</h2>

<p>So, again, we show that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of earthly oblations and of spiritual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>  were predicted; and, moreover, that from the beginning the earthly were foreshown, in the person of Cain, to be those of the <q>elder son,</q> that is, of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and the opposite <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> demonstrated to be those of the <q>younger son,</q> Abel, that is, of <em>our</em> people. For the elder, Cain, offered gifts to God from the fruit of the earth; but the younger son, Abel, from the fruit of his ewes. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had respect unto Abel, and unto his gifts; but unto Cain and unto his gifts He had not respect. And God said unto Cain, Why is your countenance fallen? Have you not&mdash; if you offer indeed aright, but do not divide aright&mdash; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? Hold your peace. For unto you shall your conversion be and he shall lord it over you. And then Cain said unto Abel his brother, Let us go into the field: and he went away with him there, and he slew him. And then God said unto Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not: am I my brother's keeper? To whom God said, The voice of the blood of your brother cries forth unto me from the earth. Wherefore cursed is the earth, which has opened her mouth to receive the blood of your brother. Groaning and trembling shall you be upon the earth, and every one who shall have found you shall slay you.</q>  From this proceeding we gather that the twofold <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of <q>the peoples</q> were even from the very beginning foreshown. In short, when the sacerdotal law was being drawn up, through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, in Leviticus, we find it prescribed to the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> should in no other place be offered to God than in the land of promise; which the Lord God was about to give to <q>the people</q> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and to their brethren, in order that, on <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> introduction there, there should there be celebrated <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, as well for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; and nowhere else but in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> land.  Why, accordingly, does the Spirit afterwards predict, through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that it should come to pass that in every place and in every land there should be offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to God? As He says through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Malachi, one of the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: <q>I will not receive <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> from your hands; for from the rising sun unto the setting my Name has been made famous among all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, says the Lord Almighty: and in every place they offer clean <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to my Name.</q>  Again, in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, David says: <q>Bring to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you countries of the nations</q>&mdash; undoubtedly because <q>unto every land</q> the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had to <q>go out</q> &mdash; <q>bring to God fame and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; bring to God the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of His name: take up  victims and enter into His courts.</q>  For that it is not by earthly <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, but by spiritual, that offering is to be made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we thus read, as it is written, An heart contribulate and humbled is a victim for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  and elsewhere, <q>Sacrifice to God a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise, and render to the Highest your vows.</q>  Thus, accordingly, the spiritual <q><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of praise</q> are pointed to, and <q>an heart contribulate</q> is demonstrated an acceptable <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And thus, as carnal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are understood to be reprobated&mdash; of which Isaiah withal speaks, saying, <q>To what end is the multitude of your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to me? Says the Lord</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031206"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;1:11</a></span> &mdash; so spiritual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are predicted  as accepted, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> announce. For, <q>even if you shall have brought me,</q> He says, <q>the finest wheat flour, it is a vain supplicatory gift: a thing execrable to me;</q> and again He says, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and the fat of goats, and blood of bulls, I will not, not even if you come to be seen by me: for who has required these things from your hands?</q>  for <q>from the rising sun unto the setting, my Name has been made famous among all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, says the Lord.</q>  But of the spiritual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> He adds, saying, <q>And in every place they offer clean <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to my Name, says the Lord.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Of the Abolition and the Abolisher of the Old Law.</h2>

<p>Therefore, since it is manifest that a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> temporal was shown, and a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> foretold; a <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> carnal foretold, and a <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> spiritual pre-indicated; a law temporal and a law <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> formally declared; <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> carnal and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> spiritual foreshown; it follows that, after all these precepts had been given carnally, in time preceding, to the people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, there was to supervene a time whereat the precepts of the ancient Law and of the old ceremonies would cease, and the promise  of the new law, and the recognition of spiritual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and the promise of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, supervene;  while the light from on high would beam upon us who were sitting in darkness, and were being detained in the shadow of death.  And so there is incumbent on us a necessity <span class="stiki" id="note031214"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:16</a></span> binding us, since we have premised that a new law was predicted by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and that not such as had been already given to their fathers at the time when He led them forth from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>,  to show and prove, on the one hand, that that old Law has ceased, and on the other, that the promised new law is now in operation.</p>

<p>And, indeed, first we must inquire whether there be expected a giver of the new law, and an heir of the new testament, and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and a purger of the new <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and an observer of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, to suppress the old law, and institute the new testament, and offer the new <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and repress the ancient ceremonies, and suppress  the old <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> together with its own <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>,  and announce the new kingdom which is not corruptible. Inquire, I say, we must, whether this giver of the new law, observer of the spiritual <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> ruler of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom, be come or no: that, if he is already come, service may have to be rendered him; if he is not yet come, he may have to be awaited, until by his advent it be manifest that the old Law's precepts are suppressed, and that the beginnings of the new law ought to arise. And, primarily, we must lay it down that the ancient Law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> could not have ceased, unless He had come who was constantly announced, through the same Law and through the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as to come.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Question Whether Christ Be Come Taken Up.</h2>

<p>Therefore upon this issue plant we foot to foot, whether the Christ who was constantly announced as to come be already come, or whether His coming be yet a subject of hope. For <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which question itself, the times likewise must be examined by us when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> announced that the Christ would come; that, if we succeed in recognising that He has come within the limits of those times, we may without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be the very one whose future coming was ever the theme of prophetic song, upon whom <em>we</em>&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, to wit&mdash; were ever announced as destined to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and that, when it shall have been agreed that He has come, we may undoubtedly likewise <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the new law has by Him been given, and not disavow the new testament in Him and through Him drawn up for us. For that Christ was to come we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that even the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> do not attempt to disprove, inasmuch as it is to His advent that they are directing their hope. Nor need we inquire at more length concerning <em>that</em> matter, since in days bygone all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have prophesied of it; as Isaiah: <q>Thus says the Lord God to my Christ (the) Lord,  whose right hand I have holden, that the nations may hear Him: the powers of kings will I burst asunder; I will open before Him the gates, and the cities shall not be closed to Him.</q> Which very thing we see fulfilled. For whose right hand does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father hold but Christ's, His Son?&mdash; whom all nations have heard, that is, whom all nations have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>&mdash;whose preachers, withal, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, are pointed to in the Psalms of David: <q>Into the universal earth,</q> says he, <q>is gone out their sound, and unto the ends of the earth their words.</q>  For upon whom else have the universal nations <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but upon the Christ who is already come? For whom have the nations <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>&mdash;Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and they who inhabit Mesopotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, Cappadocia, and they who dwell in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and Asia, and Pamphylia, tarriers in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and inhabiters of the region of Africa which is beyond Cyrene, Romans and sojourners, yes, and in Jerusalem <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,  and all other nations; as, for instance, by this time, the varied races of the G&aelig;tulians, and manifold confines of the Moors, all the limits of the Spains, and the diverse nations of the Gauls, and the haunts of the Britons&mdash; inaccessible to the Romans, but subjugated to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of the Sarmatians, and Dacians, and Germans, and Scythians, and of many remote nations, and of provinces and islands many, to us unknown, and which we can scarce enumerate? In all which places the name of the Christ who is already come reigns, as of Him before whom the gates of all cities have been opened, and to whom none are closed, before whom iron bars have been crumbled, and brazen gates  opened. Although there be withal a spiritual sense to be affixed to these expressions&mdash;that the hearts of individuals, blockaded in various ways by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, are unbarred by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash;still they have been evidently fulfilled, inasmuch as in all these places dwells the <q>people</q> of the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For who <em>could</em> have reigned <em>over all nations</em> but Christ, God's Son, who was ever announced as destined to reign over all to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>? For if Solomon <q>reigned,</q> why, it was within the confines of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> merely: <q>from Beersheba unto Dan</q> the boundaries of his kingdom are marked.  If, moreover, Darius <q>reigned</q> over the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a> and Parthians, he had not power <em>over all nations</em>; if <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, or whoever succeeded him in his hereditary kingdom, over the Egyptians, in that country merely did he possess his kingdom's dominion; if <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> with his petty kings, <q>from India unto <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a></q> he had his kingdom's boundaries;  if Alexander the Macedonian he did not hold more than universal Asia, and other regions, after he had quite conquered them; if the Germans, to this day they are not suffered to cross their own limits; the Britons are shut within the circuit of their own ocean; the nations of the Moors, and the barbarism of the G&aelig;tulians, are blockaded by the Romans, lest they exceed the confines of their own regions. What shall I say of the Romans themselves,  who fortify their own empire with garrisons of their own legions, nor can extend the might of their kingdom beyond these nations? But Christ's Name is extending everywhere, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> everywhere, worshipped by all the above-enumerated nations, reigning everywhere, adored everywhere, conferred equally everywhere upon all. No king, with Him, finds greater favour, no barbarian lesser <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; no dignities or pedigrees enjoy distinctions of merit; to all He is equal, to all King, to all Judge, to all <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031225"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;20:28</a></span> Nor would you hesitate to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what we asseverate, since you see it taking place.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Of the Times of Christ's Birth and Passion, and of Jerusalem's Destruction.</h2>

<p>Accordingly the times must be inquired into of the predicted and future nativity of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, and of the extermination of the city of Jerusalem, that is, its devastation. For Daniel says, that <q>both the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place are exterminated together with the coming Leader, and that the pinnacle is destroyed unto ruin.</q>  And so the times of the coming Christ, the Leader, <span class="stiki" id="note031227"><a href="../bible/isa055.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;55:4</a></span> must be inquired into, which we shall trace in Daniel; and, after computing them, shall prove Him to be come, even on the ground of the times prescribed, and of competent signs and operations of His. Which matters we prove, again, on the ground of the consequences which were ever announced as to follow His advent; in order that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all to have been as well fulfilled as foreseen.</p>

<p>In such wise, therefore, did Daniel predict concerning Him, as to show both when and in what time He was to set the nations free; and how, after the passion of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, that city had to be exterminated. For he says thus: <q>In the first year under Darius, son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldees, I Daniel understood in the books the number of the years....And while I was yet speaking in my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, behold, the man Gabriel, whom I saw in the vision in the beginning, flying; and he touched me, as it were, at the hour of the evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and made me understand, and spoke with me, and said, Daniel I am now come out to imbue you with understanding; in the beginning of your supplication went out a word. And I have come to announce to you, because you are a man of desires;  and ponder on the word, and understand in the vision. Seventy hebdomads have been abridged  upon your commonalty, and upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city, until delinquency be made inveterate, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> sealed, and righteousness obtained by entreaty, and righteousness <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> introduced; and in order that vision and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> may be sealed, and an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones anointed. And you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and thoroughly see, and understand, from the going forth of a word for restoring and rebuilding Jerusalem unto the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Leader, hebdomads (seven and an half, and ) lxii and an half: and it shall convert, and shall be built into height and entrenchment, and the times shall be renewed: and after these lxii hebdomads shall the anointing be exterminated, and shall not be; and the city and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place shall he exterminate together with the Leader, who is making His advent; and they shall be cut short as in a deluge, until (the) end of a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, which shall be cut short unto ruin. And he shall confirm a testament in many. In one hebdomad and the half of the hebdomad shall be taken away my <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and libation, and in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place the execration of devastation, (and ) until the end of (the) time consummation shall be given with regard to this devastation.</q> </p>

<p>Observe we, therefore, the limit&mdash;how, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he predicts that there are to be lxx hebdomads, <em>within which</em> if they receive Him, <q>it shall be built into height and entrenchment, and the times shall be renewed.</q> But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, foreseeing what was to be&mdash; that they will not merely not receive Him, but will both <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> and deliver Him to death&mdash; both recapitulated, and said, that in lx and ii and an half of an hebdomad He is born, and an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones is anointed; but that when vii hebdomads  and an half were fulfilling, He had to suffer, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city had to be exterminated after one and an half hebdomad&mdash; whereby namely, the seven and an half hebdomads have been completed. For he says thus: <q>And the city and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place to be exterminated together with the leader who is to come; and they shall be cut short as in a deluge; and he shall destroy the pinnacle unto ruin.</q>  Whence, therefore, do we show that the Christ came within the lxii and an half hebdomads? We shall count, moreover, from the first year of Darius, as at this particular time is shown to Daniel this particular vision; for he says, <q>And understand and conjecture that at the completion of your word  I make you these answers.</q> Whence we are bound to compute from the first year of Darius, when Daniel saw this vision.</p>

<p>Let us see, therefore, how the years are filled up until the advent of the Christ:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p>For Darius reigned...xviiii  years (19).

<br>Artaxerxes reigned...xl and i years (41).

<br>Then King Ochus (who is also called Cyrus) reigned...xxiiii years (24).

<br>Argus...one year.

<br>Another Darius, who is also named Melas...xxi years (21).

<br>Alexander the Macedonian...xii years (12)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Then, after Alexander, who had reigned over both Medes and Persians, whom he had reconquered, and had established his kingdom firmly in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, when withal he called that (city) by his own name;  after him reigned, (there, in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>,)</p>

<blockquote><p>Soter...xxxv years (35).

<br>To whom succeeds Philadelphus, reigning...xxx and viii years (38).

<br>To him succeeds Euergetes...xxv years (25).

<br>Then Philopator...xvii years (17).

<br>After him Epiphanes...xxiiii years (24).

<br>Then another Euergetes...xxviiii years (29).

<br>Then another Soter,...xxxviii years (38).

<br>Ptolemy...xxxvii years (37).

<br>Cleopatra,...xx years v months (20 5-12).

<br>Yet again Cleopatra reigned jointly with Augustus...xiii years (13).

<br>After Cleopatra, Augustus reigned other...xliii years (43).

<br>For all the years of the empire of Augustus were...lvi years (56).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us see, moreover, how in the forty-first year of the empire of Augustus, when he has been reigning for xx and viii years after the death of Cleopatra, the Christ is born. (And the same Augustus survived, after Christ is born, xv years; and the remaining times of years to the day of the birth of Christ will bring us to the xl first year, which is the xx and viiith of Augustus after the death of Cleopatra.) There are, (then,) made up cccxxx and vii years, v months: (whence are filled up lxii hebdomads and an half: which make up ccccxxxvii years, vi months:) on the day of the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And (then) <q>righteousness <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a></q> was manifested, and <q>an Holy One of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones was anointed</q>&mdash; that is, Christ&mdash; and <q>sealed was vision and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>,</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></q> were remitted, which, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are washed away  for all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. But what does he mean by saying that <q>vision and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> <em>are sealed</em>?</q> That all <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> ever announced of Him that He was to come and had to suffer. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> was fulfilled through His advent, for that reason he said that <q>vision and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> <em>were sealed</em>;</q> inasmuch as He is the signet of all <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, fulfilling all things which in days bygone they had announced of Him.  For after the advent of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> there is no longer <q>vision or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a></q> to announce Him as to come. In short, if this is not so, let the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> exhibit, subsequently to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, any volumes of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought by any <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, (such as those) which in bygone days the patriarchs saw until the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is now come; since which event <q>sealed is vision and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>,</q> that is, confirmed. And <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> does the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>  write, <q>The law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> (were) until John</q> the Baptist. For, on Christ's being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that is, on His sanctifying the waters in His own <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>,  all the plenitude of bygone spiritual grace-gifts ceased in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, sealing as He did all vision and prophecies, which by His advent He fulfilled. Whence most firmly does he assert that His advent <q>seals visions and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.</q></p>

<p>Accordingly, showing, (as we have done,) both the number of the years, and the time of the lx two and an half fulfilled hebdomads, on completion of which, (we have shown) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has come, that is, has been born, let us see what (mean) other <q>vii and an half hebdomads,</q> which have been subdivided in the abscision of  the former hebdomads; (let us see, namely,) in what event they have been fulfilled:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p>For, after Augustus who survived after the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are made up...xv years (15).

<br>To whom succeeded <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a>, and held the empire...xx years, vii months, xxviii days (20 etc.).

<br>(In the fiftieth year of his empire Christ suffered, being about xxx years of age when he suffered.)

<br>Again Caius C&aelig;sar, also called Caligula,...iii years, viii months, xiii days (3 etc.).

<br><a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> C&aelig;sar,...xi years, ix months, xiii days (11 etc.).

<br>Galba...vii months, vi days. (7 etc.).

<br>Otho...iii days.

<br>Vitellius,...viii mos., xxvii days (8 mos.).
</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, in the first year of his empire, subdues the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; and there are made lii years, vi months. For he reigned xi years. And thus, in the day of their storming, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> fulfilled the lxx hebdomads predicted in Daniel.</p>

<p>Therefore, when these times also were completed, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> subdued, there afterwards ceased in that place <q>libations and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>,</q> which thenceforward have not been able to be in that place celebrated; for <q>the unction,</q> too,  was <q>exterminated</q> in that place after the passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it had been predicted that the unction <em>should</em> be exterminated in that place; as in the Psalms it is prophesied, <q>They exterminated my hands and feet.</q>  And the suffering of this <q>extermination</q> was perfected within the times of the lxx hebdomads, under <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a>, in the consulate of Rubellius Geminus and Fufius Geminus, in the month of March, at the times of the passover, on the eighth day before the calends of April,  on the first day of unleavened bread, on which they slew the lamb at even, just as had been enjoined by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.  Accordingly, all the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <em>did</em> slay Him, saying to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, when he was desirous to dismiss Him, <q>His blood be upon us, and upon our children;</q>  and, <q>If you dismiss him, you are not a friend of C&aelig;sar;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031248"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;19:12</a></span> in order that all things might be fulfilled which had been written of Him. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Of the Prophecies of the Birth and Achievements of Christ.</h2>

<p>Begin we, therefore, to prove that the Birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was announced by <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; as Isaiah (<em>e.g.</em>,) foretells, <q>Listen, house of David; have no petty contest with men, since God is proposing a struggle. Therefore God Himself will give you a sign; Behold, the virgin  shall conceive, and bear a son, and you shall call his name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a></q>  (which is, interpreted, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us</q> ): <q>butter and honey shall he eat;</q> : <q>since, before the child learn to call father or mother, he shall receive the power of Damascus and the spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, in opposition to the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</q> </p>

<p>Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: Let us challenge that prediction of Isaiah, and let us institute a comparison whether, in the case of the Christ who is already come, there be applicable to Him, firstly, the name which Isaiah foretold, and (secondly) the signs of it  which he announced of Him.</p>

<p>Well, then, Isaiah foretells that it behooves Him to be called <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>; and that subsequently He is to take the power of Damascus and the spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, in opposition to the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>. <q>Now,</q> say they, <q>that (Christ) of yours, who has come, neither was called by that name, nor engaged in warfare.</q> But we, on the contrary, have thought they ought to be admonished to recall to mind <em>the context</em> of this passage as well. For subjoined is withal the interpretation of <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>&mdash; <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us</q> &mdash; in order that you may regard not the sound only of the name, but the sense too. For the Hebrew sound, which is <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, has an interpretation, which is, God with us. Inquire, then, whether this speech, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us</q> (which is <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>), be commonly applied to Christ ever since Christ's light has dawned, and I think you will not deny it. For they who out of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, ever since their believing on Him, do, whenever they shall wish to say  <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, signify that God is with us: and thus it is agreed that He who was ever predicted as <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> is already come, because that which <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> signifies has come&mdash; that is, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us.</q> Equally are they led by the sound of the name when they so understand <q>the power of Damascus,</q> and <q>the spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>,</q> and <q>the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>,</q> as if they portended Christ as a warrior; not observing that Scripture premises, <q>since, before the child learn to call father or mother, he shall receive the power of Damascus and the spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, in opposition to the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</q> For the first step is to look at the demonstration of His <em>age</em>, to see whether the age there indicated can possibly exhibit the Christ as already a <em>man</em>, not to say a <em>general</em>. Forsooth, by His babyish cry the infant would summon men to arms, and would give the signal of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> not with clarion, but with rattle, and point out the foe, not from His charger's back or from a rampart, but from the back or neck of His suckler and nurse, and thus subdue Damascus and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> in place of the breast. (It is another matter if, among you, infants rush out into battle&mdash;oiled first, I suppose, to dry in the sun, and then armed with satchels and rationed on butter&mdash;who are to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to lance sooner than how to lacerate the bosom!)  Certainly, if nature nowhere allows this&mdash;(namely,) to serve as a soldier before developing into manhood, to take <q>the power of Damascus</q> before <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> your father&mdash;it follows that the pronouncement is visibly figurative. <q>But again,</q> say they, <q>nature suffers not a 'virgin' to be a parent; and yet the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</q> And deservedly so; for he bespoke credit for a thing incredible, by saying that it was to be <em>a sign</em>. <q>Therefore,</q> he says, <q>shall a sign be given you. Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive in womb, and bear a son.</q> But a sign from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless it had consisted in some portentous novelty, would not have appeared a sign. In a word, if, when you are anxious to cast any down from (a belief in) this divine prediction, or to convert whoever are simple, you have the audacity to lie, as if the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> contained (the announcement), that not <q>a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>,</q> but <q>a young female,</q> was to conceive and bring forth; you are refuted even by this fact, that a daily occurrence&mdash; the pregnancy and parturition of a young female, namely&mdash; cannot possibly seem anything of <em>a sign</em>. And the setting before us, then, of a virgin-mother is deservedly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be <em>a sign</em>; but not equally so a warrior-infant. For there would not in this case again be involved the question of a <em>sign</em>; but, the <em>sign</em> of a novel birth having been awarded, the next step after the <em>sign</em> is, that there is enunciated a different ensuing ordering  of the infant, who is to eat <q>honey and butter.</q> Nor is this, of course, for a <em>sign</em>. It is natural to infancy. But that he is to receive  <q>the power of Damascus and the spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> in opposition to the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>,</q> this is a wondrous <em>sign</em>. Keep to the limit of (the infant's) <em>age</em>, and inquire into the sense of the prediction; nay, rather, repay to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> what you are unwilling to credit her with, and the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> becomes intelligible by the relation of its fulfilment. Let those Eastern <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, dowering with gold and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> the infancy of Christ as a king;  and the infant has received <q>the power of Damascus</q> without battle and arms. For, besides the fact that it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all that the <q>power</q>&mdash; for that is the <q>strength</q>&mdash; of the East is wont to abound in gold and odours, certain it is that the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> regard <q>gold</q> as constituting the <q>power</q> also of all other nations; as it says  through Zechariah: <q>And Judah keeps guard at Jerusalem, and shall amass all the vigour of the surrounding peoples, gold and silver.</q>  For of this gift of <q>gold</q> David likewise says, <q>And to Him shall be given of the gold of Arabia;</q>  and again, <q>The kings of the Arabs and Saba shall bring Him gifts.</q>  For the East, on the one hand, generally held the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> (to be) kings; and Damascus, on the other hand, used formerly to be reckoned to Arabia before it was transferred into Syroph&oelig;nicia on the division of the Syrias: the <q>power</q> whereof Christ then <q>received</q> in receiving its ensigns&mdash;gold, to wit, and odours. <q>The spoils,</q> moreover, <q>of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a></q> (He received in receiving) the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> themselves, who, on recognising Him, and honouring Him with gifts, and adoring Him on bended knee as Lord and King, on the evidence of the guiding and indicating star, became <q>the spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>,</q> that is, of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>&mdash; by believing, namely, on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For (Scripture) denoted <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> by the name of <q><a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>,</q> <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> being ignominious on the score of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; for she had at that time revolted from God under King <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>. For this, again, is no novelty to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>, figuratively to use a transference of <em>name</em> grounded on parallelism of <em>crimes</em>. For it  calls your rulers <q>rulers of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>,</q> and your people the <q>people of Gomorrha,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031267"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;1:10</a></span> when those cities had already long been extinct.  And elsewhere it says, through a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, to the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <q>Your father (was) an Amorite, and your mother an Hittite;</q>  of whose race they were not begotten, but (were called their sons) by reason of their consimilarity in impiety, whom of old (God) had called <em>His own sons</em> through Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>I have generated and exalted sons.</q>  So, too, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> is sometimes understood to mean the whole world  in that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, on the count of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> and malediction.  So, again, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, in our own John, is a figure of the city Rome, as being equally great and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of her sway, and triumphant over the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.  On this wise, accordingly, (Scripture)  entitled the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> also with the appellation of <q><a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>,</q>&mdash; <q>despoiled</q> (of that) which they had had in common with the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, as we have said&mdash; <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. (It  adds), <q>in opposition,</q> moreover, <q>to the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>,</q>&mdash; in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who to this hour thinks himself to be reigning, if he detrudes the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> from the religion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, this our interpretation will be supported while (we find that) elsewhere as well the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> designate Christ a warrior, as we gather from the names of certain weapons, and words of that kind. But by a comparison of the remaining senses the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> shall be convicted. <q>Gird you,</q> says David, <q>the sword upon the thigh.</q>  But what do you read above concerning the Christ? <q>Blooming in beauty above the sons of men; <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is outpoured in your lips.</q>  But very absurd it is if he was complimenting on the bloom of his beauty and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of his lips, one whom he was girding for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with a sword; of whom he proceeds subjunctively to say, <q>Outstretch and prosper, advance and reign!</q> And he has added, <q>because of your lenity and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</q>  Who will ply the sword without practising the contraries to lenity and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; that is, guile, and asperity, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, proper (of course) to the business of battles? See we, then, whether that which has another action be not another sword&mdash;that is, the Divine word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, doubly sharpened  with the two Testaments of the ancient law and the new law; sharpened by the equity of its own wisdom; rendering to each one according to his own action.  Lawful,  then, it was for the Christ of God to be precinct, in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, without warlike achievements, with the figurative sword of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to which sword is congruous the predicated <q>bloom,</q> together with the <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the lips;</q> with which sword He was then <q>girt upon the thigh,</q> in the eye of David, when He was announced as about to come to earth in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father's decree. <q>The greatness of your right hand,</q> he says, <q>shall conduct you</q> &mdash; the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to wit, of the spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from which the recognition of Christ is deduced. <q>Your arrows,</q> he says, <q>are sharp,</q> &mdash; God's everywhere-flying precepts (arrows) threatening the exposure  of every heart, and carrying compunction and transfixion to each <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>: <q>peoples shall fall beneath you,</q> &mdash; of course, in adoration. Thus mighty in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and weapon-bearing is Christ; thus will He <q>receive the spoils,</q> not of <q><a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a></q> alone, but of all nations as well. Acknowledge that His <q>spoils</q> are figurative whose weapons you have learned to be allegorical. And thus, so far, the Christ who has come was not a warrior, because He was not predicted as such by Isaiah.</p>

<p><q>But if the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> say they, <q>who is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be coming is not called Jesus, why is he who has come called <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>?</q> Well, each name will meet in the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom is found likewise the appellation  Jesus. Learn the habitual character of your <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. In the course of the appointing of a successor to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, Oshea  the son of Nun  is certainly transferred from his pristine name, and begins to be called Jesus.  Certainly, you say. This we first assert to have been a figure of the future. For, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was to introduce the second people (which is composed of us nations, lingering deserted in the world  aforetime) into the land of promise, <q>flowing with milk and honey</q>  (that is, into the possession of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, than which nought is sweeter); and this had to come about, not through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (that is, not through the Law's discipline), but through Joshua (that is, through the new law's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>), after our <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> with <q>a knife of rock</q>  (that is, with Christ's precepts, for Christ is in many ways and figures predicted as a rock ); therefore the man who was being prepared to act as images of this sacrament was inaugurated under the figure of the Lord's name, even so as to be named Jesus.  For He who ever spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself; who, too, was always <em>seen</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note031294"><a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse5">Numbers&nbsp;12:5-8</a></span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father none ever saw, and lived.  And accordingly it is agreed that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and said to the people, <q>Behold, I send mine <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> before your</q>&mdash; that is, the people's&mdash; <q>face, to guard you on the march, and to introduce you into the land which I have prepared you: attend to him, and be not disobedient to him; for he has not escaped  your notice, since my name is upon him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031297"><a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;23:20-21</a></span> For Joshua was to introduce the people into the land of promise, not <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Now He called him an <q><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>,</q> on account of the magnitude of the mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which he was to achieve (which mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> Joshua the son of Nun did, and you yourselves read), and on account of his office of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> announcing (to wit) the divine will; just as withal the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, speaking in the person of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, calls the forerunner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, John, a future <q><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>,</q> through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Behold, I send mine <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> before Your</q>&mdash; that is, Christ's&mdash; <q>face, who shall prepare Your way before You.</q>  Nor is it a novel practice to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to call those <q><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></q> whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has appointed as ministers of His power. For the same John is called not merely an <q><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a></q> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but withal a <q>lamp</q> shining before Christ: for David predicts, <q>I have prepared the lamp for my Christ;</q>  and him Christ Himself, coming <q>to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,</q>  called so to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <q>He was,</q> He says, <q>the burning and shining lamp;</q>  as being he who not merely <q>prepared His ways in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>,</q>  but withal, by pointing out <q>the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  illumined the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by his heralding, so that they understood Him to be that Lamb whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was wont to announce as destined to suffer. Thus, too, (was the son of Nun called) Joshua, on account of the future <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  of his name: for that name (He who spoke with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>) confirmed as His own which Himself had conferred on him, because He had bidden him thenceforth be called, not <q><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a></q> nor <q>Oshea,</q> but <q>Joshua.</q> Thus, therefore, each name is appropriate to the Christ of God&mdash; that He should be called Jesus as well (as Christ).</p>

<p>And that the virgin of whom it behooved Christ to be born (as we have above mentioned) must derive her lineage of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in subsequent passages evidently asserts. <q>And there shall be born,</q> he says, <q>a rod from the root of Jesse</q>&mdash; which rod is Mary&mdash; <q>and a flower shall ascend from his root: and there shall rest upon him the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of discernment and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, the spirit of counsel and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; the spirit of God's <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> shall fill Him.</q>  For to none of men was the universal aggregation of spiritual credentials appropriate, except to Christ; paralleled as He is to a <q>flower</q> by reason of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, by reason of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but accounted <q>of the root of Jesse,</q> whence His origin is to be deduced,&mdash; to wit, through Mary.  For He was from the native soil of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and from the house of David; as, among the Romans, Mary is described in the census, of whom is born Christ. </p>

<p>I demand, again&mdash; granting that He who was ever predicted by <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as destined to come out of Jesse's race, was withal to exhibit all humility, patience, and tranquillity&mdash; whether He be come? Equally so (in this case as in the former), the man who is shown to bear that character will be the very Christ who has come. For of Him the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>A man set in a plague, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how to bear infirmity;</q> who <q>was led as a sheep for a victim; and, as a lamb before him who shears him, opened not His mouth.</q>  If He <q>neither did contend nor shout, nor was His voice heard abroad,</q> who <q>crushed not the bruised reed</q>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who <q>quenched not the burning flax</q> &mdash; that is, the momentary glow of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>&mdash; but made it shine more by the rising of His own light&mdash;He can be none other than He who was predicted. The action, therefore, of the Christ who has come must be examined by being placed side by side with the rule of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For, if I mistake not, we find Him distinguished by a twofold operation&mdash;that of <em>preaching</em> and that of <em>power</em>. Now, let each count be disposed of summarily. Accordingly, let us work out the order we have set down, teaching that Christ was announced as a <em>preacher</em>; as, through Isaiah: <q>Cry out,</q> he says, <q>in vigour, and spare not; lift up, as with a trumpet, your voice, and announce to my commonalty their crimes, and to the house of Jacob their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Me from day to day they seek, and to learn my ways they <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>, as a people which has done righteousness, and has not forsaken the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and so forth:  that, moreover, He was to do acts of <em>power</em> from the Father: <q>Behold, our God will deal retributive judgment; Himself will come and save us: then shall the infirm be healed, and the eyes of the blind shall see, and the ears of the deaf shall hear, and the mutes' tongues shall be loosed, and the lame shall leap as an hart,</q>  and so on; which works not even you deny that Christ did, inasmuch as you were wont to say that, <q>on account of the works you <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> Him not, but because He did them on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Concerning the Passion of Christ, and Its Old Testament Predictions and Adumbrations.</h2>

<p>Concerning the last step, plainly, of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> you raise a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; affirming that the passion of the cross was not predicted with reference to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and urging, besides, that it is not credible that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should have exposed His own Son to that kind of death; because Himself said, <q>Cursed <em>is</em> every one who shall have hung on a tree.</q>  But the <em>reason</em> of the case antecedently explains the sense of this malediction; for He says in Deuteronomy: <q>If, moreover, (a man) shall have been (involved) in some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurring the judgment of death, and shall die, and you shall suspend him on a tree, his body shall not remain on the tree, but with burial you shall bury him on the very day; because cursed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is every one who shall have been suspended on a tree; and you shall not defile the land which the Lord your God shall give you for (your) lot.</q>  Therefore He did not maledictively adjudge Christ to this passion, but drew a distinction, that whoever, <em>in any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em>, had incurred the judgment of death, and died suspended on a tree, <em>he</em> should be <q>cursed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> because his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his suspension on the tree. On the other hand, Christ, who spoke not guile from His mouth,  and who exhibited all righteousness and humility, not only (as we have above recorded it predicted of Him) was not exposed to that kind of death <em>for his own deserts</em>, but (was so exposed) in order that what was predicted by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as destined to come upon Him through your means  might be fulfilled; just as, in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, the Spirit Himself of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was already singing, saying, <q>They were repaying me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for good;</q>  and, <q>What I had not seized I was then paying in full;</q>  <q>They exterminated my hands and feet;</q>  and, <q>They put into my drink gall, and in my thirst they slaked me with vinegar;</q>  <q>Upon my vesture they did cast (the) lot;</q>  just as the other (outrages) which you were to commit on Him were foretold&mdash;all which He, actually and thoroughly suffering, suffered not for any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action of His own, but <q>that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> from the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> might be fulfilled.</q> </p>

<p>And, of course, it had been meet that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  of the passion itself should be figuratively set forth in predictions; and the more incredible (that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>), the more likely to be <q>a stumbling-stone,</q>  if it had been nakedly predicted; and the more magnificent, the more to be <em>adumbrated</em>, that the difficulty of its intelligence might seek (help from) the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Accordingly, to begin with, Isaac, when led by his father as a victim, and himself bearing his own <q>wood,</q>  was even at that early period pointing to Christ's death; conceded, as He was, as a victim by the Father; carrying, as He did, the <q>wood</q> of His own passion. </p>

<p>Joseph, again, himself was made a figure of Christ  in this point alone (to name no more, not to delay my own course), that he suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> at the hands of his brethren, and was sold into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, on account of the favour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  just as Christ was sold by <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>&mdash; (and therefore,) <q>according to the flesh,</q> by His <q>brethren</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031329"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;9:5</a></span> &mdash; when He is betrayed by Judas.  For Joseph is withal blest by his father  after this form: <q>His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> (is that) of a bull; his horns, the horns of an unicorn; on them shall he toss nations alike unto the very extremity of the earth.</q> Of course no one-horned rhinoceros was there pointed to, nor any two-horned minotaur. But Christ was therein signified: <q>bull,</q> by reason of each of His two characters&mdash;to some fierce, as Judge; to others gentle, as Saviour; whose <q>horns</q> were to be the extremities of the <em>cross</em>. For even in a ship's yard&mdash; which is part of a <em>cross</em>&mdash; this is the name by which the extremities are called; while the central pole of the mast is a <q>unicorn.</q> By this power, in fact, of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and in this manner horned, He does now, on the one hand, <q>toss</q> universal nations through <em><a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>, wafting them away from earth to heaven; and will one day, on the other, <q>toss</q> them through <em>judgment</em>, casting them down from heaven to earth.</p>

<p>He, again, will be the <q>bull</q> elsewhere too in the same scripture.  When Jacob pronounced a blessing on Simeon and Levi, he prophesies of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>; for from them  is derived their  origin. For (his blessing) interprets spiritually thus: <q>Simeon and Levi perfected iniquity out of their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>,</q> &mdash; whereby, to wit, they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Christ: <q>into their counsel come not my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>! And upon their station rest not my heart! Because in their indignation they slew men</q>&mdash; that is, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; <q>and in their concupiscence they hamstrung a bull!</q> &mdash; that is, Christ, whom&mdash; after the slaughter of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; they slew, and exhausted their savagery by transfixing His sinews with nails. Else it is idle if, after the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> already committed by them, he upbraids others, and not them, with butchery. </p>

<p>But, to come now to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, why, I wonder, did he merely at the time when Joshua was battling against Amalek, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <em>sitting</em> with hands expanded, when, in circumstances so critical, he ought rather, surely, to have commended  his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by knees bended, and hands beating his breast, and a face prostrate on the ground; except it was that there, where the name of the Lord Jesus was the theme of speech&mdash; destined as He was to enter the lists one day singly against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>&mdash; the figure of the <em>cross</em> was also necessary, (that figure) through which Jesus was to win the victory?  Why, again, did the same <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, after the prohibition of any <q>likeness of anything,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031339"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse4">Exodus&nbsp;20:4</a></span> set forth a brazen serpent, placed on a <q>tree,</q> in a hanging posture, for a spectacle of healing to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, at the time when, after their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>,  they were suffering extermination by serpents, except that in this case he was exhibiting the Lord's <em>cross</em> on which the <q>serpent</q> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was <q>made a show of,</q>  and, for every one hurt by such snakes&mdash; that is, his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> &mdash; on turning intently from the peccancy of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <em>cross</em>, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was outwrought? For he who then gazed upon <em>that</em> (<em>cross</em>) was freed from the bite of the serpents. </p>

<p>Come, now, if you have read in the utterance of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has reigned <em>from the tree</em>,</q>  I wait to hear what you understand thereby; for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> you may perhaps think some carpenter-king  is signified, and not Christ, who has reigned from that time onward when he overcame the death which ensued from His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> of <q>the tree.</q></p>

<p>Similarly, again, Isaiah says: <q>For a child is born to us, and to us is given a son.</q>  What novelty is that, unless he is speaking of the <q>Son</q> of God?&mdash; and one is born to us the beginning of whose government has been made <q>on His shoulder.</q> What king in the world wears the ensign of his power <em>on his shoulder</em>, and does not bear either diadem on his head, or else sceptre in his hand, or else some mark of distinctive vesture? But the <em>novel</em> <q>King of ages,</q> Christ Jesus, alone reared <q>on His shoulder</q> His own <em>novel</em> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and power, and sublimity&mdash;the <em>cross</em>, to wit; that, according to the former <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, the Lord thenceforth <q>might reign <em>from the tree</em>.</q> For of this tree likewise it is that God hints, through Jeremiah, that you would say, <q>Come, let us put <em>wood</em>  <em>into his bread</em>, and let us wear him away out of the land of the living; and his name shall no more be remembered.</q>  Of course on His <em>body</em> that <q>wood</q> was put;  for so Christ has revealed, calling His body <q>bread,</q>  whose body the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in bygone days announced under the term <q>bread.</q> If you shall still seek for predictions of the Lord's cross, the twenty-first Psalm will at length be able to satisfy you, containing as it does the whole passion of Christ; singing, as He does, even at so early a date, His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.  <q>They dug,</q> He says, <q>my hands and feet</q> &mdash; which is the peculiar atrocity of the cross; and again when He implores the aid of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>Save me,</q> He says, <q>out of the mouth of the lion</q>&mdash; of course, of death&mdash; <q>and from the horn of the unicorns my humility,</q> &mdash; from the ends, to wit, of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, as we have above shown; which cross neither David himself suffered, nor any of the kings of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: that you may not think the passion of some other particular man is here prophesied than His who alone was so signally crucified by the People.</p>

<p>Now, if the hardness of your heart shall persist in rejecting and deriding all these interpretations, we will prove that it may suffice that the <em>death</em> of the Christ had been prophesied, in order that, from the fact that the <em>nature</em> of the death had not been specified, it may be understood to have been affected by means of the <em>cross</em>  and that the passion of the <em>cross</em> is not to be ascribed to any but Him whose <em>death</em> was constantly being predicted. For I desire to show, in one utterance of Isaiah, His <em>death</em>, and <em>passion</em>, and <em>sepulture</em>. <q>By the crimes,</q> he says, <q>of my people was He led unto death; and I will give the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for His sepulture, and the rich for His death, because He did not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, nor was guile found in his mouth; and God willed to redeem His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from death,</q>  and so forth. He says again, moreover: <q>His sepulture has been taken away from the midst.</q>  For neither was He buried except He were dead, nor was His sepulture removed from the midst except through His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. Finally, he subjoins: <q>Therefore He shall have many for an heritage, and of many shall He divide spoils:</q>  who else (shall so do) but He who <q>was born,</q> as we have above shown?&mdash; <q>in return for the fact that His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was delivered unto death?</q> For, the <em><a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a></em> of the favour accorded Him being shown&mdash;in return, to wit, for the injury of <em>a death</em> which had to be recompensed,&mdash; it is likewise shown that He, destined to attain these rewards <em>because of</em> death, was to attain them <em>after</em> death&mdash; of course after <em>resurrection</em>. For that which happened at His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, that mid-day grew dark, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Amos announces, saying, <q>And it shall be,</q> he says, <q>in that day, says the Lord, the sun shall set at mid-day, and the day of light shall grow dark over the land: and I will convert your festive days into grief, and all your canticles into lamentation; and I will lay upon your loins sackcloth, and upon every head baldness; and I will make the grief like that for a beloved (son), and them that are with him like a day of mourning.</q>  For that you would do thus at the beginning of the first month of your new (years) even <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> prophesied, when he was foretelling that all the community of the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was  to immolate at eventide a lamb, and were to eat  this solemn <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of this day (that is, of the passover of unleavened bread) with bitterness; and added that <q>it was the <em>passover of the Lord</em>,</q>  that is, the <em>passion of Christ</em>. Which prediction was thus also fulfilled, that <q>on the first day of unleavened bread</q>  you slew Christ; <span class="stiki" id="note031363"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span> and (that the prophecies might be fulfilled) the day hasted to make an <q>eventide,</q>&mdash; that is, to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> darkness, which was made at mid-day; and thus <q>your festive days God converted into grief, and your canticles into lamentation.</q> For after the passion of Christ there overtook you even captivity and dispersion, predicted before through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Further Proofs, from Ezekiel. Summary of the Prophetic Argument Thus Far.</h2>

<p>For, again, it is for these deserts of yours that Ezekiel announces your ruin as about to come: and not only in this age &mdash; a ruin which has already befallen&mdash; but in the <q>day of retribution,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031365"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;61:2</a></span> which will be subsequent. From which ruin none will be freed but he who shall have been frontally sealed  with the passion of the Christ whom you have rejected. For thus it is written: <q>And the Lord said unto me, <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, you have seen what the elders of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> do, each one of them in darkness, each in a hidden bed-chamber: because they have said, The Lord sees us not; the Lord has derelinquished the earth. And He said unto me, Turn you again, and you shall see greater enormities which these do. And He introduced me unto the thresholds of the gate of the house of the Lord which looks unto the north; and, behold, there, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> sitting and bewailing Thammuz. And the Lord said unto me, <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, have you seen? Is the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a> <em>moderate</em>, to do the enormities which they have done? And yet you are about to see greater affections of theirs. And He introduced me into the inner shrine of the house of the Lord; and, behold, on the thresholds of the house of the Lord, between the midst of the porch and between the midst of the altar,  as it were twenty and five men have turned their backs unto the temple of the Lord, and their faces over against the east; these were adoring the sun. And He said unto me, Do you see, <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>? Are such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> trifles to the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a>, that they should do the enormities which these have done? Because they have filled up (the measure of) their impieties, and, behold, <em>are</em> themselves, as it were, grimacing; I will deal with mine indignation,  my eye shall not spare, neither will I pity; they shall cry out unto mine ears with a loud voice, and I will not hear them, nay, I will not pity. And He cried into mine ears with a loud voice, saying, The vengeance of this city is at hand; and each one had vessels of extermination in his hand. And, behold, six men were coming toward the way of the high gate which was looking toward the north, and each one's double-axe of dispersion was in his hand: and one man in the midst of them, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, <span class="stiki" id="note031369"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse13">Revelation&nbsp;1:13</a></span> and a girdle of sapphire about his loins: and they entered, and took their stand close to the brazen altar. And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which was over the house, in the open court of it,  ascended from the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>: and the Lord called the man who was clothed with the garment reaching to the feet, who had upon his loins the girdle; and said unto him, Pass through the midst of Jerusalem, and write the sign Tau  on the foreheads of the men who groan and grieve over all the enormities which are done in their midst. And while these things were doing, He said unto an hearer,  Go after him into the city, and cut short; and spare not with your eyes, and pity not elder or youth or virgin; and slay all the little ones and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, that they may be thoroughly wiped away; but all upon whom is the sign Tau approach not; and begin with my <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q>  Now the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of this <q>sign</q> was in various ways predicted; (a <q>sign</q>) in which the foundation of life was forelaid for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; (a <q>sign</q>) in which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: just as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> beforetime kept on announcing in Exodus,  saying, <q>You shall be ejected from the land into which you shall enter; and in those nations you shall not be able to rest: and there shall be instability of the print  of your foot: and God shall give you a wearying heart, and a pining <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and failing eyes, that they see not: and your life shall hang on the tree  before your eyes; and you shall not trust your life.</q></p>

<p>And so, since <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> has been fulfilled through His advent&mdash; that is, through the nativity, which we have above commemorated, and the passion, which we have evidently explained&mdash; that is the reason withal why Daniel said, <q>Vision and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <em>were sealed</em>;</q> because Christ is the <q>signet</q> of all <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, fulfilling all that had in days bygone been announced concerning Him: for, since His advent and personal passion, there is no longer <q>vision</q> or <q><a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>;</q> whence most emphatically he says that His advent <q> <em>seals</em> vision and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.</q> And thus, by showing <q>the number of the years, and the time of the lxii and an half fulfilled hebdomads,</q> we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that at that specified time Christ came, that is, was born; and, (by showing the time) of the <q>seven and an half hebdomads,</q> which are subdivided so as to be cut off from the former hebdomads, within which times we have shown Christ to have suffered, and by the consequent conclusion of the <q>lxx hebdomads,</q> and the extermination of the city, (we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>) that <q><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and unction</q> thenceforth cease.</p>

<p>Sufficient it is thus far, on these points, to have meantime traced the course of the ordained path of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by which He is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be such as He used to be announced, even on the ground of that agreement of Scriptures, which has enabled us to speak out, in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, on the ground  of the prejudgment of the major part. For let them not question or deny the writings we produce; that the fact also that things which were foretold as destined to happen <em>after</em> Christ are being recognised as fulfilled may make it impossible for them to deny (these writings) to be on a par with <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>. Else, unless He had come <em>after</em> whom the things which were wont to be announced had to be accomplished, would such as have been completed be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>? </p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Further Proofs from the Calling of the Gentiles.</h2>

<p>Look at the universal nations thenceforth emerging from the vortex of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to the Lord God the Creator and His Christ; and if you dare to deny that this was prophesied, immediately occurs to you the promise of the Father in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, which says, <q>My Son are You; today have I begotten You. Ask of Me, and I will give You <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <em>as</em> Your heritage, and <em>as</em> Your possession <em>the</em> bounds of the earth.</q>  For you will not be able to affirm that <q>son</q> to be David rather than Christ; or the <q>bounds of the earth</q> to have been promised rather to David, who reigned within the single (country of) <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, than to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who has already taken captive the whole orb with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of His gospel; as He says through Isaiah: <q>Behold, I have given You for a covenant  of my <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, for a light of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that You may open the eyes of the blind</q>&mdash; of course, such as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>&mdash; <q>to outloose from bonds the bound</q>&mdash; that is, to free them from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash; <q>and from the house of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a></q>&mdash; that is, of death&mdash; <q>such as sit in darkness</q> &mdash; of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, to wit. And if these blessings accrue through Christ, they will not have been prophesied of another than Him through whom we consider them to have been accomplished. <span class="stiki" id="note031382"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;2:25-33</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Argument from the Destruction of Jerusalem and Desolation of Judea.</h2>

<p>Therefore, since the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> affirm that we <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in receiving the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, who is already come, let us put in a demurrer against them out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves, to the effect that the Christ who was the theme of prediction <em>is</em> come; albeit by the times of Daniel's prediction we <em>have</em> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the Christ has come already who was the theme of announcement. Now it behooved Him to be born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of Judah. For thus it is written in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>And you, <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, are not the least in the leaders of Judah: for out of you shall issue a Leader who shall feed my People <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  But if hitherto he has not been born, what <q>leader</q> was it who was thus announced as to proceed from the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, out of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>? For it behooves him to proceed from the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a> and from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. But we perceive that <em>now</em> none of the race of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has remained in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>; and (so it has been) ever since the interdict was issued forbidding any one of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to linger in the confines of the very district, in order that this prophetic utterance also should be perfectly fulfilled: <q>Your land is desert, your cities burnt up by fire,</q>&mdash; that is, (he is foretelling) what <em>will have happened</em> to them in time of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> <q>your region strangers shall eat up in your sight, and it shall be desert and subverted by alien peoples.</q>  And in another place it is thus said through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>The King with <em>His</em> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> you shall see,</q>&mdash; that is, Christ, doing <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of power in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father;  <q>and your eyes shall see the land from afar,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031386"><a href="../bible/isa033.htm#verse17">Isaiah&nbsp;33:17</a></span> &mdash; which is what you do, being prohibited, in reward of your deserts, since the storming of Jerusalem, to enter into your land; it is permitted you merely to see it with your eyes from afar: <q>your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,</q> he says, <q>shall meditate terror,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031387"><a href="../bible/isa033.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;33:18</a></span> &mdash; namely, at the time when they suffered the ruin of themselves.  How, therefore, will a <q>leader</q> be born from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and how far will he <q>proceed from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>,</q> as the divine volumes of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> do plainly announce; since none at all is left there to this day of (the house of) <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, of whose stock Christ could be born?</p>

<p>Now, if (according to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>) He is hitherto not come, when He begins to come whence will He be anointed?  For the Law enjoined that, in captivity, it was not lawful for the unction of the royal chrism to be compounded. <span class="stiki" id="note031390"><a href="../bible/exo030.htm#verse22">Exodus&nbsp;30:22-33</a></span> But, if there is no longer <q>unction</q> <em>there</em>  as Daniel prophesied (for he says, <q>Unction shall be exterminated</q>), it follows that <em>they</em>  no longer have it, because neither have they a <em>temple</em> where was the <q>horn</q>  from which kings were wont to be anointed. If, then, there is no unction, whence shall be anointed the <q>leader</q> who shall be born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>? Or how shall he proceed <q>from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>,</q> seeing that of the seed of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> none at all exists in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>.</p>

<p>A second time, in fact, let us show that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is already come, (as foretold) through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and has suffered, and is already received back in the heavens, and thence is to come accordingly as the predictions prophesied. For, after His advent, we read, according to Daniel, that the city itself had to be exterminated; and we recognise that so it has befallen. For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says thus, that <q>the city and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place are simultaneously exterminated together with <em>the leader</em>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031394"><a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse26">Daniel&nbsp;9:26</a></span> &mdash; undoubtedly (that Leader) who was to proceed <q>from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>,</q> and from the tribe of <q>Judah.</q> Whence, again, it is manifest that <q>the city must simultaneously be exterminated</q> at the time when its <q>Leader</q> had to suffer in it, (as foretold) through the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who say: <q>I have outstretched my hands the whole day unto a People contumacious and gainsaying Me, who walks in a way not good, but after their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  And in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <em>David</em> says: <q>They exterminated my hands and feet: they counted all my bones; they themselves, moreover, contemplated and saw me, and in my thirst slaked me with vinegar.</q>  These things <em>David</em> did not suffer, so as to seem <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> to have spoken of himself; but the Christ who was crucified. Moreover, the <q>hands and feet,</q> are not <q>exterminated,</q>  except His who is suspended on a <q>tree.</q> Whence, again, David said that <q>the Lord would reign <em>from the tree</em>:</q>  for elsewhere, too, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> predicts the fruit of this <q>tree,</q> saying <q>The earth has given her blessings,</q> &mdash; of course that virgin-earth, not yet irrigated with rains, nor fertilized by showers, out of which man was of yore first formed, out of which now Christ through the flesh has been born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; <q>and <em>the tree</em>,</q>  he says, <q>has brought his fruit,</q> &mdash; not that <q>tree</q> in paradise which yielded death to the protoplasts, but the <q>tree</q> of the passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whence life, hanging, was by you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>!  For this <q>tree</q> in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>,  it was of yore wherewith <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> sweetened the bitter water; whence the People, which was perishing of thirst in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, drank and revived;  just as we do, who, drawn out from the calamities of the heathendom  in which we were tarrying perishing with thirst (that is, deprived of the divine word), drinking, <q>by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is on Him,</q>  the baptismal water of the <q>tree</q> of the passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have revived&mdash;a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from which <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has fallen away, (as foretold) through Jeremiah, who says, <q>Send, and ask exceedingly whether such things have been done, whether nations will change their gods (and these are not gods!). But My People has changed their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: whence no profit shall accrue to them: the heaven turned pale thereat</q> (and when did it turn pale? Undoubtedly when Christ suffered), <q>and shuddered,</q> he says, <q>most exceedingly;</q>  and <q>the sun grew dark at mid-day:</q>  (and when did it <q>shudder exceedingly</q> except at the passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when the earth also trembled to her centre, and the veil of the temple was rent, and the tombs were burst asunder?  <q>because these two <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> has My People done; Me,</q> He says, <q>they have quite forsaken, the fount of water of life,  and they have dug for themselves worn-out tanks, which will not be able to contain water.</q> Undoubtedly, by not receiving Christ, the <q>fount of water of life,</q> they have begun to have <q>worn-out tanks,</q> that is, <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> for the use of the <q>dispersions of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q>  in which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> no longer lingers, as for the time past He was wont to tarry in the temple before the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, that they should withal suffer this thirst of the Divine Spirit, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah had said, saying: <q>Behold, they who serve Me shall eat, but you shall be hungry; they who serve Me shall drink, but you shall thirst, and from general tribulation of spirit shall howl: for you shall transmit your name for a satiety to Mine elect, but you the Lord shall slay; but for them who serve Me shall be named a new name, which shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the lands.</q> </p>

<p>Again, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of this <q>tree</q>  we read as being celebrated even in the Books of the Reigns. For when the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were cutting <q>wood</q>  with axes on the bank of the river Jordan, the iron flew off and sank in the stream; and so, on Elisha  the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> coming up, the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> beg of him to extract from the stream the iron which had sunk. And accordingly Elisha, having taken <q>wood,</q> and cast it into that place where the iron had been submerged, immediately it rose and swam on the surface,  and the <q>wood</q> sank, which the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> recovered.  Whence they understood that Elijah's spirit was presently conferred upon him.  What is more manifest than the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  of this <q>wood,</q>&mdash; that the obduracy of this world  had been sunk in the profundity of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and is freed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by the <q>wood</q> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>; in order that what had formerly perished through the <q>tree</q> in Adam, should be restored through the <q>tree</q> in Christ?  while we, of course, who have succeeded to, and occupy, the room of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, at the present day sustain in the world  that treatment which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> always suffered on account of divine religion: for some they <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, some they banished; more, however, they delivered to mortal slaughter, &mdash; a fact which they cannot deny. </p>

<p>This <q>wood,</q> again, Isaac the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> personally carried for his own <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, when God had enjoined that he should be made a victim to Himself. But, because these had been <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>  which were being kept for perfect fulfilment in the times of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Isaac, on the one hand, with his <q>wood,</q> was reserved, the ram being offered which was caught by the horns in the bramble;  Christ, on the other hand, in His times, carried His <q>wood</q> on His own shoulders, adhering to the horns of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, with a thorny crown encircling His head. For Him it behooved to be made a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> on behalf of all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who <q>was led as a sheep for a victim, and, like a lamb voiceless before his shearer, so opened not His mouth</q> (for He, when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> interrogated Him, spoke nothing ); for <q>in humility His judgment was taken away: His nativity, moreover, who shall declare?</q> Because no one at all of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings was conscious of the nativity of Christ at His conception, when as the Virgin Mary was found pregnant by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and because <q>His life was to be taken from the land.</q>  Why, accordingly, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the dead, which was effected on the third day, did the heavens receive Him back? It was in accordance with a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Hosea, uttered on this wise: <q>Before daybreak shall they arise unto Me, saying, Let us go and return unto the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because Himself will draw <em>us</em> out and free us. After a space of two days, on the third day</q> &mdash; which is His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> resurrection&mdash; He received back into the heavens (whence withal the Spirit Himself had come to the Virgin ) Him whose nativity and passion alike the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have failed to acknowledge. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> still contend that the Christ is not yet come, whom we have in so many ways approved  to be come, let the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> recognise their own <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>&mdash;a <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> which they were constantly foretold as destined to incur after the advent of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, on account of the impiety with which they despised and slew Him. For first, from the day when, according to the saying of Isaiah, <q>a man cast forth his abominations of gold and silver, which they made to adore with vain and hurtful (<a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>),</q> &mdash; that is, ever since we <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, with our breast doubly enlightened through Christ's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, cast forth (let the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> see it) our <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>&mdash;what follows has likewise been fulfilled. For <q>the Lord of Sabaoth <em>has taken away</em>, among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from Jerusalem,</q> among the other things named, <q>the wise architect</q> too,  who builds the church, God's temple, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city, and the house of the Lord. For thenceforth God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> desisted (from working) among them. And <q>the clouds were commanded not to rain a shower upon the vineyard of Sorek,</q> &mdash; the clouds being celestial benefits, which were commanded not to be forthcoming to the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; for it <q>had borne <em>thorns</em></q>&mdash; whereof that house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had wrought a crown for Christ&mdash; and not <q> <em>righteousness</em>, but a <em>clamour</em>,</q>&mdash; the clamour whereby it had extorted His surrender to the cross.  And thus, the former gifts of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> being withdrawn, <q>the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were until John,</q>  and the fishpool of <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida</a>  until the advent of Christ: thereafter it ceased curatively to remove from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> infirmities of health; since, as the result of their perseverance in their frenzy, the name of the Lord was through them <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, as it is written: <q>On your account the name of God is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>:</q>  for it is from them that the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> (attached to that name) began, and (was propagated during) the interval from <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> to <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>. And because they had committed these crimes, and had failed to understand that Christ <q>was to be found</q>  in <q>the time of their visitation,</q>  their land has been made <q>desert, and their cities utterly burnt with fire, while strangers devour their region in their sight: the daughter of Sion is derelict, as a watchtower in a vineyard, or as a shed in a cucumber garden,</q>&mdash; ever since the time, to wit, when <q><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not</q> the Lord, and <q>the People understood Him not;</q> but rather <q>quite forsook, and provoked unto indignation, the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  So, again, we find a <em>conditional</em> threat of <em>the sword</em>: <q>If you shall have been unwilling, and shall not have been <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, the glaive shall eat you up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031442"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;1:20</a></span> Whence we prove that <em>the sword</em> was Christ, by not hearing whom they perished; who, again, in the Psalm, demands of the Father their dispersion, saying, <q>Disperse them in Your power;</q>  who, withal, again through Isaiah <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for their <em>utter burning</em>. <q>On My account,</q> He says, <q>have these things happened to you; in anxiety shall you sleep.</q> </p>

<p>Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were predicted as destined to suffer these calamities <em>on Christ's account</em>, and we find that they <em>have</em> suffered them, and see them sent into dispersion and abiding in it, manifest it is that it is on Christ's account that these things <em>have</em> befallen the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the sense of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> harmonizing with the issue of events and of the order of the times. Or else, if Christ is not yet come, on whose account they were predicted as destined thus to suffer, when He <em>shall have</em> come it follows that they <em>will</em> thus suffer. And where will then be a daughter of Sion to be derelict, who <em>now</em> has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>? Where the cities to be exust, which are already exust and in heaps? Where the dispersion of a race which is now in exile? Restore to <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> the condition which Christ is to find; and (then, if you will), contend that some other (Christ) is coming.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Conclusion. Clue to the Error of the Jews.</h2>

<p>Learn now (over and above the immediate question) the clue to your <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. We affirm, <em>two</em> characters of the Christ demonstrated by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and as many <em>advents</em> of His forenoted: one, in humility (of course the first), when He has to be led <q>as a sheep for a victim; and, as a lamb voiceless before the shearer, so He opened not His mouth,</q> not even in His aspect comely. For <q>we have announced,</q> says <em>the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a></em>, <q>concerning Him, (He is) as a little child, as a root in a thirsty land; and there was not in Him attractiveness or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And we saw Him, and He had not attractiveness or <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but His mien was unhonoured, deficient in comparison of the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q>  <q>a man <em>set</em> in the plague,  and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how to bear infirmity:</q> to wit as having been set by the Father <q>for a stone of offense,</q>  and <q>made a little lower</q> by Him <q>than <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q>  He pronounces Himself <q>a worm, and not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, an ignominy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and <em>the</em> refuse of <em>the</em> People.</q>  Which evidences of ignobility suit the <span class="sc">First Advent</span>, just as those of sublimity do the Second; when He shall be made no longer <q>a stone of offense nor a rock of scandal,</q> but <q>the highest corner-stone,</q>  after reprobation (on earth) taken up (into heaven) and raised sublime for the purpose of consummation, <span class="stiki" id="note031451"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse10">Ephesians&nbsp;1:10</a></span> and that <q>rock</q>&mdash; so we must admit&mdash; which is read of in Daniel as forecut from a mount, which shall crush and crumble the image of secular kingdoms.  Of which second advent of the same (Christ) Daniel has said: <q>And, behold, as it were a <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, coming with the clouds of the heaven, came unto the Ancient of days, and was present in His sight; and they who were standing by led (Him) unto Him. And there was given Him royal power; and all nations of the earth, according to their race, and all <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, shall serve Him: and His power <em>is</em> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, which shall not be taken away, and His kingdom <em>one</em> which shall not be corrupted.</q>  Then, assuredly, is He to have an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> mien, and a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> not <q>deficient more than the sons of men;</q> for (He will then be) <q>blooming in beauty in comparison with the sons of men.</q>  <q>Grace,</q> says <em>the Psalmist</em>, <q>has been outpoured in Your lips: wherefore God has blessed You unto <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Gird You Your sword around Your thigh, most potent in Your bloom and beauty!</q>  while the Father withal afterwards, after making Him somewhat lower than <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <q>crowned Him with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and subjected all <em>things</em> beneath His feet.</q>  And then shall they <q>learn to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him whom they pierced, and shall beat their breasts tribe by tribe;</q>  of course because in days bygone they did <em>not</em> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him when conditioned in the humility of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> estate. Jeremiah says: <q>He is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, and who will learn to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him?</q>  because, <q>His nativity,</q> says Isaiah, <q>who shall declare?</q> So, too, in Zechariah, in His own person, nay, in the very <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  of His name withal, the most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Priest of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, His own  Christ, is delineated in a twofold garb with reference to the <span class="sc">two advents</span> .  First, He was clad in <q>sordid attire,</q> that is, in the indignity of passible and mortal flesh, when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, withal, was opposing himself to Him&mdash; the instigator, to wit, of Judas the traitor &mdash; who even after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> had tempted Him. In the next place, He was stripped of His former sordid raiment, and adorned with a garment down to the foot, and with a turban and a clean mitre, that is, (with the garb) of the <span class="sc">second advent</span>; since He is demonstrated as having attained <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</q> Nor will you be able to say that the man (there depicted) is <q>the son of Jozadak,</q>  who was never at all clad in a sordid garment, but was always adorned with the sacerdotal garment, nor ever deprived of the sacerdotal function. But the <q>Jesus</q>  there alluded to is Christ, the Priest of God the most high Father; who at His <span class="sc">first advent</span> came in humility, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and passible, even up to the period of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>; being Himself likewise made, through all (stages of suffering) a victim for us all; who after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> was <q>clad with a garment down to the foot,</q>  and named the Priest of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father unto <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.  So, again, I will make an interpretation of the two goats which were <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> offered on the fast-day.  Do not they, too, point to each successive stage in the character of the Christ who is already come? A pair, on the one hand, and consimilar (they were), because of the identity of the Lord's general appearance, inasmuch as He is not to come in some other form, seeing that He has to be recognised by those by whom He was once hurt. But the one of them, begirt with scarlet, amid cursing and universal spitting, and tearing, and piercing, was cast away by the People outside the city into perdition, marked with manifest tokens of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> passion; who, after being begirt with scarlet garment, and subjected to universal spitting, and afflicted with all contumelies, was crucified outside the city.  The other, however, offered for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and given as food <em>to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> merely</em> of the temple,  gave signal evidences of the second appearance; in so far as, after the expiation of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the spiritual temple, that is, of the church, were to enjoy  a spiritual public distribution (as it were) of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, while all others are <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> from <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, since the vaticinations of the <span class="sc">first advent</span> obscured it with manifold figures, and debased it with every dishonour, while the second (was foretold as) manifest and wholly worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it has resulted therefrom, that, by fixing their gaze on that one alone which they could easily understand and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> (that is, the second, which is in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>), they have been (not undeservedly) deceived as to the more obscure&mdash; at all events, the more unworthy&mdash; that is, the first . And thus to the present moment they affirm that their Christ is not come, because He is not come in majesty; while they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of  the fact that He was first to come in humility.</p>

<p>Enough it is, meantime, to have thus far followed the stream downward of the order of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> course, whereby He is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> such as He was <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> announced: in order that, as a result of this harmony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>, we may understand; and that the events which used to be predicted as destined to take place after Christ may be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been accomplished as the result of a divine arrangement. For unless He come <em>after</em> whom they had to be accomplished, by no means would the events, the future occurrence whereof was predictively assigned to His advent, have come to pass. Therefore, if you see universal nations thenceforth emerging from the profundity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to God the Creator and His Christ (which you dare not assert to have not been prophesied, because, albeit you were so to assert, there would immediately&mdash; as we have already premised &mdash; occur to you the promise of the Father saying, <q>My Son are You; I this day have begotten You; ask of Me, and I will give You <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <em>as</em> Your heritage, and <em>as</em> Your possession the boundaries of the earth.</q> Nor will you be able to vindicate, as the subject of that prediction, rather the son of David, Solomon, than Christ, God's Son; nor <q>the boundaries of the earth,</q> as promised rather to David's son, who reigned within the single land of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, than to Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who has already illumined the whole world  with the rays of His gospel. In short, again, a throne <q>unto the age</q>  is more suitable to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, God's Son, than to Solomon,&mdash; a temporal king, to wit, who reigned over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> alone. For at the present day nations are invoking Christ which used not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him; and peoples at the present day are fleeing in a body to the Christ of whom in days bygone they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> ), you cannot contend that is future which you see taking place.  Either deny that these events were prophesied, while they are seen before your eyes; or else have been fulfilled, while you hear them read: or, on the other hand, if you fail to deny each position, they will have their fulfilment in Him with respect to whom they were prophesied.</p>
