<h1>An Exposition of the Chapters of the Acts of the Apostles</h1> 

<p>Having had ourselves the advantage of the method and model received from our fathers and teachers, we attempt, in a modest way, to give these in this exposition of the chapters, entreating your forgiveness for the rashness of such an endeavour in us who are young in point both of years and of study,  and looking to have the indulgence  of every one who reads this writing in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> on our behalf. We make this exposition, therefore, after the history of Luke, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> and historian. And, accordingly, we have indicated whole chapters by the letters of the alphabet,  and their subdivisions into parts we have noted by means of the asterisk. </p>

<p>A. Of Christ's teaching after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, and of His appearing to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and of the promise of the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and of the spectacle and manner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> assumption. </p>

<p>B. Peter's discourse to those who were made <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, on the subject of the death and reprobation  of Judas;  * in this chapter we have also the section on the substitution of Matthias, who was elected by lot through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<p>C. Of the divine descent  of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> on the day of Pentecost which lighted on them who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. In this we have also the instruction delivered by Peter, and * passages from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> on the subject, and * on the passion and resurrection and assumption of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; also * of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those present, and their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and, further, * of the unity of spirit pervading the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> and promoting the common good, and of the addition made to their number.</p>

<p>D. Of the healing in (the name of) Christ of the man lame from his birth; and of the discourse  of Peter, in which he reasons and sympathizes and counsels with respect to his  <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And here we have * the interposition  of the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> through jealousy of what had taken place, and their judgment on the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, and Peter's confession  of the power and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Also the section on* the unbelieving chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, commanding that they should not speak boldly in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,  and of the dismissal  of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Then * the thanksgivings offered up by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for the faithful constancy of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>

<p>E. Of the harmonious and universal fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>; and also*of Ananias and Sapphira and their miserable end.</p>

<p>F. Of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> being cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and led out of it by night by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord, who enjoined them to preach Jesus without restraint; and * of the fact that, on the following day, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> apprehended them again, and, after scourging them, sent them away with the charge not to teach any longer. Then * the trusty opinion of <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a> touching the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, together with certain examples and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. G. Of the election of the seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>.</p>

<p>H. The rising and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> information of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> against Stephen, and his address concerning the covenant of God with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and concerning the twelve patriarchs. Also the account of the famine and the buying of grain, and the mutual recognition of the sons of Jacob, and of the birth of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the appearance of God  to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, which took place at Mount Sinai. * Also of the exodus and and calf-making of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (and other matters), up to the times of Solomon and the building of the temple. * Then the acknowledgment of the supercelestial <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> which was revealed to Stephen himself, on account of which Stephen was himself <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, and fellasleep piously.</p>

<p>I. Of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the burial of Stephen; also * of the healing of many in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> by Philip the apostle.</p>

<p>J. Of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with many others; also* of the sending of Peter and John to them, and their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>K. That the participation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was not given  for money,  nor to hypocrites, but to <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; also* of the hypocrisy and the reproof of Simon.</p>

<p>L. That the Lord helps the good and the believing on the way to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as is shown from the instance of the eunuch.</p>

<p>M. Of the divine call that came from heaven for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the apostleship of Christ; also* of the healing and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> by the hand of Ananias, in accordance with the revelation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of his boldness of speech and his association with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> by the instrumentality of Barnabas. </p>

<p>N. Of the paralytic Aeneas who was cured by Peter at Lydda. Also* the account of Tabitha, the friend of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, whom Peter raised from the dead by means of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in Joppa.</p>

<p>O. Of Cornelius, and what the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to him. Also what was spoken  to Peter from heaven with respect to the calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Then* that Peter, on being summoned, came to Cornelius. *The repetition by Cornelius of the things which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> hid  to Cornelius himself. *Peter's instruction of them in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> upon those who heard him, and how those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> there.</p>

<p>R. The slaying of the Apostle James. *Also the apprehension of Peter by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and the account of the manner in which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by divine command delivered him from his bonds, and how Peter, after showing himself to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> by night, quietly withdrew.

<p>S. The sending of <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>.*The things which he did  there in the name of Christ on Elymas the sorcerer.</p>
