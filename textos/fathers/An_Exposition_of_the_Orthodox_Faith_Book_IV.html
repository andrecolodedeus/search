<h1>An Exposition of the Orthodox Faith (Book IV)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Concerning what followed the Resurrection.</h2>

<p>After Christ was risen from the dead He laid aside all His <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, I mean His corruption or hunger or thirst or sleep or weariness or such like. For, although He did taste food after the resurrection <span class="stiki" id="note332252"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;24:43</a></span>, yet He did not do so because it was a law of His nature (for He felt no hunger), but in the way of economy, in order that He might convince us of the reality of the resurrection, and that it was one and the same flesh which suffered and rose again.  But He laid aside none of the divisions of His nature, neither body nor spirit, but possesses both the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> intelligent and reasonable, volitional and energetic, and in this wise He sits at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, using His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> both as God and as man in behalf of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, energising in His divine capacity to provide for and maintain and govern all things, and remembering in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> capacity the time He spent on earth, while all the time He both sees and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that He is adored by all rational creation. For His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that He is one in substance with <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, and shares as <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> and not simply as Spirit the worship accorded to Him. Moreover, His ascent from earth to heaven, and again, His descent from heaven to earth, are manifestations of the energies of His circumscribed body. <em>For He shall so come again to you, says he, in like manner as you have seen Him go into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note332254"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;1:11</a></span> .</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Concerning the sitting at the right hand of the Father.</h2>

<p>We hold, moreover, that Christ sits in the body at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but we do not hold that the right hand of the Father is actual place. For how could He that is uncircumscribed have a right hand limited by place? Right hands and left hands belong to what is circumscribed. But we understand the right hand of the Father to be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Godhead in which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> as God before the ages, and is of like <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and in the end became flesh, has a seat in the body, His flesh sharing in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For He along with His flesh is adored with one adoration by all creation. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. In reply to those who say  <q>If Christ has two natures, either you do service to the creature in worshipping created nature, or you say that there is one nature to be worshipped, and another not to be worshipped.</q></h2>

<p>Along with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> we worship the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Who was incorporeal before He took on humanity, and now in His own person is incarnate and has become man though still being also God. His flesh, then, in its own nature , if one were to make subtle mental distinctions between what is seen and what is thought, is not deserving of worship since it is created. But as it is united with <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, it is worshipped on account of Him and in Him. For just as the king deserves homage alike when un-robed and when robed, and just as the purple robe, considered simply as a purple robe, is trampled upon and tossed about, but after becoming the royal dress receives all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and whoever dishonours it is generally condemned to death: and again, just as wood in itself  is not of such a nature that it cannot be touched, but becomes so when fire is applied to it, and it becomes charcoal, and yet this is not because of its own nature, but because of the fire united to it, and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the wood is not such as cannot be touched, but rather the charcoal or burning wood: so also the flesh, in its own nature, is not to be worshipped, but is worshipped in the incarnate God Word, not because of itself, but because of its union in subsistence with <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>. And we do not say that we worship mere flesh, but God's flesh, that is, God incarnate.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Why it was the Son of God, and not the Father or the Spirit, that became man: and what having became man He achieved.</h2>

<p>The Father is Father  and not Son : the Son is Son and not Father: the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is Spirit and not Father or Son. For the individuality  is unchangeable. How, indeed, could individuality continue to exist at all if it were ever changing and altering? Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> became <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> in order that His individuality might endure. For since He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, He became <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, being made flesh of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin and not losing the individuality of Sonship. </p>

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> became man, in order that He might again bestow on man that favour for the sake of which He created him. For He created him after His own image, endowed with <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and after His own likeness, that is to say, perfect in all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> so far as it is possible for man's nature to attain perfection. For the following properties are, so to speak, marks of the divine nature: viz. absence of care and distraction and guile, goodness, wisdom, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, freedom from all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. So then, after He had placed man in communion with Himself (for having made him for incorruption <span class="stiki" id="note332263"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse23">Wisdom&nbsp;2:23</a></span>, He led him up through communion with Himself to incorruption), and when moreover, through the transgression of the command we had confused and obliterated the marks of the divine image, and had become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, we were stripped of our communion with God (for what communion has light with darkness <span class="stiki" id="note332264"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:14</a></span>?): and having been shut out from life we became subject to the corruption of death: yea, since He gave us to share in the better part, and we did not keep it secure, He shares in the inferior part, I mean our own nature, in order that through Himself and in Himself He might renew that which was made after His image and likeness, and might teach us, too, the conduct of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life, making through Himself the way there easy for us, and might by the communication of life deliver us from corruption, becoming Himself the firstfruits of our resurrection, and might renovate the useless and worn vessel calling us to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God that He might redeem us from the tyranny of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and might strengthen and teach us how to overthrow the tyrant through patience and humility. </p>

<p>The worship of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> then has ceased: creation has been sanctified by the divine blood: altars and temples of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> have been overthrown, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God has been implanted in men's minds, the co-essential Trinity, the uncreate divinity, one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Creator and Lord of all receives men's service: <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are cultivated, the hope of resurrection has been granted through the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> shudder at those men who of old were under their subjection. And the marvel, indeed, is that all this has been successfully brought about through His cross and passion and death. Throughout all the earth the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God has been preached; no <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> or weapons or armies being used to rout the enemy, but only a few, naked, poor, illiterate, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and tormented men, who with their lives in their hands, preached Him Who was crucified in the flesh and died, and who became victors over the wise and powerful. For the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> power of the Cross accompanied them. Death itself, which once was man's chiefest terror, has been overthrown, and now that which was once the object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> and loathing is preferred to life. These are the achievements of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> presence: these are the tokens of His power. For it was not one people that He saved, as when through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> He divided the sea and delivered <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the bondage of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> <span class="stiki" id="note332266"><a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse16">Exodus&nbsp;14:16</a></span>; nay, rather He rescued all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> from the corruption of death and the bitter tyranny of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: not leading them by force to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not overwhelming them with earth or burning them with fire, or ordering the sinners to be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, but persuading men by gentleness and long-suffering to choose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and vie with one another, and find pleasure in the struggle to attain it. For, formerly, it was sinners who were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and yet they clung all the closer to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was looked upon by them as their God: but now for the sake of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> men choose <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> and crucifixions and death.</p>

<p>Hail! O Christ, the Word and Wisdom and Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>! What can we helpless ones give You in return for all these good gifts? For all are Yours, and Thou ask naught from us save our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, You Who Yourself art the Giver of this, and yet art grateful to those who receive it, through Your unspeakable goodness. Thanks be to You Who gave us life, and granted us the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life, and restored us to that, when we had gone astray, through Your unspeakable condescension.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. In reply to those who ask if Christ's subsistence is create or uncreate.</h2>

<p>The subsistence  of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> before the Incarnation was simple and uncompound, and incorporeal and uncreate: but after it became flesh, it became also the subsistence of the flesh, and became compounded of divinity which it always possessed, and of flesh which it had assumed: and it bears the properties of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, being made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>: so that the one same subsistence is both uncreate in divinity and create in humanity, visible and invisible. For otherwise we are compelled either to divide the one Christ and speak of two subsistences, or to deny the distinction between the natures and thus introduce change and confusion.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Concerning the question, when Christ was called.</h2>

<p>The mind was not united with <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, as some <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> assert , before the Incarnation by the Virgin and from that time called Christ. That is the absurd nonsense of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>  who lays down the doctrine of the priority of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. But we hold that the Son and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> became Christ after He had dwelt in the womb of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ever-virgin Mother, and became flesh without change, and that the flesh was anointed with divinity. For this is the anointing of humanity, as <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory the Theologian</a> says.  And here are the words of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Cyril of Alexandria which he wrote to the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> : <q>For I indeed hold that one ought to give the name <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> neither to the Word that is of God if He is without humanity, nor yet to the temple born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> if it is not united with the Word. For the Word that is of God is understood to be Christ when united with humanity in ineffable manner in the union of the &oelig;conomy. </q> And again, he writes to the Empresses thus : <q>Some hold that the name 'Christ' is rightly given to the Word that is begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, to Him alone, and regarded separately by Himself. But we have not been taught so to think and speak. For when the Word became flesh, then it was, we say, that He was called Christ Jesus. For since He was anointed with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, that is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, by Him Who is God and Father, He is for this reason  called Christ. But that the anointing was an act that concerned Him as man could be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> by no one who is accustomed to think rightly.</q> Moreover, the celebrated Athanasius says this in his discourse <q>Concerning the Saving Manifestation:</q> <q>The God Who was before the sojourn in the flesh was not man, but God in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being invisible and without passion, but when He became man, He received in addition the name of Christ because of the flesh, since, indeed, passion and death follow in the train of this name.</q></p>

<p>And although the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture  says, <em>Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed you with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a></em> , it is to be observed that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture often uses the past tense instead of the future, as for example here: <em>Thereafter He was seen upon the earth and dwelt among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332277"><a href="../bible/bar003.htm#verse38">Baruch&nbsp;3:38</a></span> For as yet God was not seen nor did He dwell among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> when this was said. And here again: <em>By the rivers of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, there we sat down; yea wept</em>.  For as yet these things had not come to pass.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. In answer to those who enquire whether the holyMother of God bore two natures, and whether two natures hung upon the Cross.</h2>

<p><span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>, written with one '<span class="greek">&#x03BD;' </span> and meaning uncreated and created, refer to nature: but <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>, that is to say, unbegotten and begotten, as the double '<span class="greek">&#x03BD;</span> ' indicates, refer not to nature but to subsistence. The divine nature then is <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, that is to say, uncreate, but all things that come after the divine nature are <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>, that is, created. In the divine and uncreated nature, therefore, the property of being <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> or unbegotten is contemplated in the Father (for He was not begotten), that of being <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> or begotten in the Son (for He has been <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> begotten of the Father), and that of procession in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Moreover of each species of living creatures, the first members were <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span> but not <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>: for they were brought into being by their Maker, but were not the offspring of creatures like themselves. For <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span> is creation, while <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span> or begetting is in the case of God the origin of a co-essential Son arising from the Father alone, and in the case of bodies, the origin of a co-essential subsistence arising from the contact of male and female. And thus we perceive that begetting refers not to nature but to subsistence.  For if it did refer to nature, <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03BF; &#x1F00;&#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>, i.e. the properties of being begotten and unbegotten, could not be contemplated in one and the same nature. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> bore a subsistence revealed in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; being begotten on the one hand, by reason of its divinity, of the Father timelessly, and, at last, on the other hand, being incarnated of her in time and born in the flesh.</p>

<p>But if our interrogators should hint that He Who is begotten of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> is two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, we reply, <q>Yea! He is two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>: for He is in His own person <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And the same is to be said concerning the crucifixion and resurrection and ascension. For these refer not to nature but to subsistence. Christ then, since He is in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, suffered and was crucified in the nature that was subject to passion. For it was in the flesh and not in His divinity that He hung upon the Cross. Otherwise, let them answer us, when we ask if two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> died. No, we shall say. And so two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> were not crucified but Christ was begotten, that is to say, the divine Word having become man was begotten in the flesh, was crucified in the flesh, suffered in the flesh, while His divinity continued to be impassible.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 8. How the Only-begotten Son of God is called first-born.</h2>

<p>He who is first begotten is called <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> , whether he is only-begotten or the first of a number of brothers. If then the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was called <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, but was not called Only-begotten, we could <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that He was the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of creatures, as being a creature.  But since He is called both <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> and Only-begotten, both senses must be preserved in His case. We say that He is <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of all creation <span class="stiki" id="note332283"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;1:15</a></span> since both He Himself is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creation is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as He Himself is born alone and timelessly of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He may with reason be called Only-begotten Son, <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> and not first-created. For the creation was not brought into being out of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> out of nothing.  And He is called First-born among many brethren <span class="stiki" id="note332285"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;8:29</a></span>, for although being Only-begotten, He was also born of a mother. Since, indeed, He participated just as we ourselves do in blood and flesh and became man, while we too through Him became sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being adopted through the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, He Who is by nature <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> became <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> among us who were made by adoption and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and stand to Him in the relation of brothers. Wherefore He said, <em>I ascend unto My Father and your Father</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332286"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span> He did not say <q>our Father,</q> but <q>My Father,</q> clearly in the sense of Father by nature, and <q>your Father,</q> in the sense of Father by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And <q>My God and your God. </q> He did not say <q>our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> but <q>My God:</q> and if you distinguish with subtle thought that which is seen from that which is thought, also <q>your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> as Maker and Lord.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Concerning Faith and Baptism.</h2>

<p>We confess one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and for life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> declares the Lord's death. We are indeed <q>buried with the Lord through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> <span class="stiki" id="note332288"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse12">Colossians&nbsp;2:12</a></span>,</q> as says the divine Apostle. So then, as our Lord died once for all, we also must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> once for all, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> according to the Word of the Lord, <em>In the Name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note332289"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span>, being taught the confession in Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Those , then, who, after having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and having been taught that there is one divine nature in three subsistences, are rebaptized, these, as the divine Apostle says, crucify the Christ afresh. <em>For it is impossible, he says, for those who were once enlightened, etc., to renew them again unto repentance: seeing they crucify to themselves the Christ afresh, and put Him to an open shame</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332291"><a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;6:4</a></span> But those who were not baptized  into the Holy Trinity, these must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again. For although the divine Apostle says: <em>Into Christ and into His death were we <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note332292"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;6:3</a></span>, he does not mean that the invocation of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> must be in these words, but that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is an image of the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For by the three immersions , <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> signifies the three days of our Lord's entombment.  The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> then into Christ means that <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Him. We could not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ if we were not taught confession in Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.  For Christ is the Son of the Living God <span class="stiki" id="note332296"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span>, Whom the Father anointed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> <span class="stiki" id="note332297"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse38">Acts&nbsp;10:38</a></span>: in the words of the divine David, <em>Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed you with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above your fellows</em>.  And Isaiah also speaking in the person of the Lord says, <em>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon me because He has anointed me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332299"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;61:1</a></span> Christ, however, taught His own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the invocation and said, <em>Baptizing them in the Name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332300"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> For since Christ made us for incorruption  , and we transgressed His saving command, He condemned us to the corruption of death in order that that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should not be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and when in His compassion He stooped to His servants and became like us, He redeemed us from corruption through His own passion. He caused the fountain of remission to well forth for us out of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and immaculate side <span class="stiki" id="note332303"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;19:34</a></span>, water for our regeneration, and the washing away of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and corruption; and blood to drink as the hostage of life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And He laid on us the command to be born again of water and of the Spirit , through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and invocation, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> drawing near unto the water.  For since man's nature is twofold, consisting of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, He bestowed on us a twofold purification, of water and of the Spirit: the Spirit renewing that part in us which is after His image and likeness, and the water by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit cleansing the body from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and delivering it from corruption, the water indeed expressing the image of death, but the Spirit affording the earnest of life.</p>

<p>For from the beginning <em>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> moved upon the face of the waters</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332306"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;1:2</a></span>, and anew the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> witnesses that water has the power of purification. <span class="stiki" id="note332307"><a href="../bible/lev015.htm#verse10">Leviticus&nbsp;15:10</a></span> In the time of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> God washed away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world by water. <span class="stiki" id="note332308"><a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;6:17</a></span> By water every impure person is purified , according to the law, even the very garments being washed with water. Elias showed forth the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit mingled with the water when he burned the holocaust by pouring on water.  And almost everything is purified by water according to the law: for the things of sight are <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of the things of thought. The regeneration, however, takes place in the spirit: for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has the power of making us sons (of God ), creatures as we are, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and of leading us into our original blessedness.</p>

<p>The remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, therefore, is granted alike to all through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit is proportional to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and previous purification. Now, indeed, we receive the firstfruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and the second birth is for us the beginning and seal and security and illumination  of another life.</p>

<p>It behooves us, then, with all our strength to steadfastly keep ourselves pure from filthy works, that we may not, like the dog returning to his vomit <span class="stiki" id="note332313"><a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse22">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:22</a></span>, make ourselves again the slaves of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> apart from works is dead, and so likewise are works apart from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note332314"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse26">James&nbsp;2:26</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is attested by works.</p>

<p>Now we are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>  into the Holy Trinity because those things which are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> have need of the Holy Trinity for their maintenance and continuance, and the three subsistences cannot be otherwise than present, the one with the other. For the Holy Trinity is indivisible.</p>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>  was that of the flood for the eradication of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The second <span class="stiki" id="note332317"><a href="../bible/gen007.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;7:17</a></span> was through the sea and the cloud: for the cloud is the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the Spirit and the sea of the water. <span class="stiki" id="note332318"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:1</a></span> The third <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was that of the Law: for every impure person washed himself with water, and even washed his garments, and so entered into the camp. <span class="stiki" id="note332319"><a href="../bible/lev014.htm#verse8">Leviticus&nbsp;14:8</a></span> The fourth  was that of John , being preliminary and leading those who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> to repentance, that they might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ: <em>I, </em> <em>indeed</em>, he said, <em><a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with water; but He that comes after me, He will <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and in fire</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332322"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;3:11</a></span> Thus John's purification with water was preliminary to receiving the Spirit. The fifth was the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of our Lord, whereby He Himself was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Now He is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> not as Himself requiring purification but as making my purification His own, that He may break the heads of the dragons on the water,  that He may wash away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and bury all the old <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in water, that He may sanctify the Baptist, that He may fulfil the Law, that He may reveal the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Trinity, that He may become the type and ensample to us of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. But we, too, are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the perfect <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of our Lord, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by water and the Spirit. Moreover,  Christ is said to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with fire: because in the form of flaming tongues He poured forth on His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit: as the Lord Himself says, <em>John <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water: but you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and with fire, not many days hence:</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332325"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse5">Acts&nbsp;1:5</a></span> or else it is because of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of future fire wherewith we are to be chastized.  The sixth is that by repentance and tears, which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> grievous. The seventh is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by blood and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>,  which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> Christ Himself underwent in our behalf, <span class="stiki" id="note332328"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse50">Luke&nbsp;12:50</a></span> He Who was too august and blessed to be defiled with any later stains.  The eighth  is the last, which is not saving, but which destroys <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>:  for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no longer have sway: yet it punishes without end. </p>

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>  descended in bodily form as a dove, indicating the firstfruits of our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and honouring the body: since even this, that is the body, was God by the deification; and besides the dove was wont formerly to announce the cessation of the flood. But to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles He came down in the form of fire:  for He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <em>God is a consuming fire</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332335"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse24">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:24</a></span> </p>

<p>Olive oil  is employed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> as a significant of our anointing,  and as making us anointed, and as announcing to us through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> God's pity: for it was the fruit of the olive that the dove brought to those who were saved from the flood. <span class="stiki" id="note332338"><a href="../bible/gen008.htm#verse11">Genesis&nbsp;8:11</a></span> </p>

<p>John was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, putting his hand upon the divine head of his Master, and with his own blood.</p>

<p>It does not behoove  us to delay <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> when the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those coming forward is testified to by their works. For he that comes forward deceitfully to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> will receive condemnation rather than benefit.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Concerning Faith.</h2>

<p>Moreover, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is twofold. For <em><a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> comes by hearing</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332340"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;10:17</a></span> For by hearing the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. The same is perfected by all the things enjoined by Christ, believing in work, cultivating <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and doing the commands of Him Who restored us. For he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not according to the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or who has intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> through strange works, is an unbeliever.</p>

<p>But again, <em><a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332341"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;11:1</a></span>, or undoubting and unambiguous hope alike of what God has promised us and of the good issue of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The first, therefore, belongs to our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, while the second is of the gifts of the Spirit.</p>

<p>Further, observe that by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> we cut  off all the covering which we have worn since birth, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and become spiritual <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> and God's people.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Concerning the Cross and here further concerning Faith.</h2>

<p>The word ' <em>Cross</em>' <em>is foolishness to those that perish, but to us who are saved it is the power of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332343"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> For <em>he that is spiritual judges all things, but the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit.</em>  For it is foolishness to those who do not receive in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and who do not consider God's goodness and omnipotence, but search out divine things with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and natural reasonings. For all the things that are of God are above nature and reason and conception. For should any one consider how and for what purpose God brought all things out of nothing and into being, and aim at arriving at that by natural reasonings, he fails to comprehend it. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this kind belongs to spirits and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But if any one, under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, should consider the divine goodness and omnipotence and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, he will find all things smooth and even, and the way straight. <em>But without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible to be saved</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332345"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;11:6</a></span> For it is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that all things, both <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and spiritual, are sustained. For without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> neither does the farmer  cut his furrow, nor does the merchant commit his life to the raging waves of the sea on a small piece of wood, nor are marriages contracted nor any other step in life taken. By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we consider that all things were brought out of nothing into being by God's power. And we direct all things, both divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is assent free from all meddlesome inquisitiveness. </p>

<p>Every action, therefore, and performance of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by Christ are most great and divine and marvellous: but the most marvellous of all is His precious Cross. For no other thing has subdued death, expiated the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first parent , despoiled Hades, bestowed the resurrection, granted the power to us of contemning the present and even death itself, prepared the return to our former blessedness, opened the gates of Paradise , given our nature a seat at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and made us the children and heirs of God , save the Cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. For by the Cross  all things have been made right. <em>So many of us, the apostle says, as were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ, were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into His death</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332352"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;6:3</a></span>, and <em>as many of you as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ, have put on Christ</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332353"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians&nbsp;3:27</a></span> Further <em>Christ is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332354"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> Lo! The death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, the Cross, clothed us with the enhypostatic wisdom and power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the power of God is the Word of the Cross, either because God's might, that is, the victory over death, has been revealed to us by it, or because, just as the four extremities of the Cross are held fast and bound together by the bolt in the middle, so also by God's power the height and the depth, the length and the breadth, that is, every creature visible and invisible, is maintained. </p>

<p>This was given to us as a sign on our forehead, just as the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was given to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: for by it we <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are separated and distinguished from unbelievers. This is the shield and weapon against, and trophy over, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <em>This is the seal that the destroyer may not touch you</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332356"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse23">Exodus&nbsp;12:23</a></span>, as says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>. This is the resurrection of those lying in death, the support of the standing, the staff of the weak, the rod of the flock, the safe conduct of the earnest, the perfection of those that press forwards, the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, the aversion of all things <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the patron of all things good, the taking away of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the plant of resurrection, the tree of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<p>So, then, this same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> precious and august tree , on which Christ has offered Himself as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for our sakes, is to be worshipped as sanctified by contact with His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body and blood; likewise the nails, the spear, the clothes, His sacred tabernacles which are the <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>, the cave, Golgotha, which brings <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> , the tomb which gives life, Sion, the chief stronghold of the churches and the like, are to be worshipped. In the words of David, the father of God , <em>We shall go into His tabernacles, we shall worship at the place where His feet stood</em>.  And that it is the Cross that is meant is made clear by what follows, <em>Arise, O Lord, into Your Rest</em>.  For the resurrection comes after the Cross. For if of those things which we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, house and couch and garment, are to be longed after, how much the rather should we long after that which belonged to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our Saviour , by means of which we are in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> saved.</p>

<p>Moreover we worship even the image of the precious and life-giving Cross, although made of another tree, not honouring the tree (God forbid) but the image as a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For He said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, admonishing them, <em>Then shall appear the sign of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note332363"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;24:30</a></span>, meaning the Cross. And so also the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the resurrection said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <em>You seek <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a> which was crucified</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332364"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse6">Mark&nbsp;16:6</a></span> And the Apostle said, <em>We preach Christ crucified</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332365"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> For there are many Christs and many Jesuses, but one crucified. He does not say speared but crucified. It behooves us, then, to worship the sign of Christ.  For wherever the sign may be, there also will He be. But it does not behoove us to worship the material of which the image of the Cross is composed, even though it be gold or precious stones, after it is destroyed, if that should happen. Everything, therefore, that is dedicated to God we worship, conferring the adoration on Him.</p>

<p>The tree of life which was planted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Paradise pre-figured this precious Cross. For since death was by a tree, it was fitting that life and resurrection should be bestowed by a tree.  Jacob, when He worshipped the top of Joseph's staff, was the first to image the Cross, and when he blessed his sons with crossed hands <span class="stiki" id="note332368"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse21">Hebrews&nbsp;11:21</a></span> he made most clearly the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>. Likewise  also did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> rod, when it smote the sea in the figure of the cross and saved <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, while it overwhelmed <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> in the depths; likewise also the hands stretched out crosswise and routing Amalek; and the bitter water made sweet by a tree, and the rock rent and pouring forth streams of water <span class="stiki" id="note332370"><a href="../bible/num020.htm">Numbers&nbsp;xx</a></span>, and the rod that meant for <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a> <span class="stiki" id="note332371"><a href="../bible/exo004.htm">Exodus&nbsp;iv</a></span>: and the serpent lifted in triumph on a tree as though it were dead , the tree bringing <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to those who in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> saw their enemy dead, just as Christ was nailed to the tree in the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.  The mighty <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> cried , <em>You will see your life hanging on the tree before your eyes</em>, and Isaiah likewise, <em>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a faithless and rebellious people</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332375"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;65:2</a></span> But may we who worship this  obtain a part in Christ the crucified. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Concerning Worship towards the East.</h2>

<p>It is not without reason or by chance that we worship towards the East. But seeing that we are composed of a visible and an invisible nature, that is to say, of a nature partly of spirit and partly of sense, we render also a twofold worship to the Creator; just as we sing both with our spirit and our bodily lips, and are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with both water and Spirit, and are united with the Lord in a twofold manner, being sharers in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit.</p>

<p>Since, therefore, God  is spiritual light <span class="stiki" id="note332378"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:5</a></span>, and Christ is called in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> Sun of Righteousness <span class="stiki" id="note332379"><a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse2">Malachi&nbsp;4:2</a></span> and Dayspring , the East is the direction that must be assigned to His worship. For everything good must be assigned to Him from Whom every good thing arises. Indeed the divine David also says, <em>Sing unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord: to Him that rides upon the Heavens of heavens towards the East</em>.  Moreover the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> also says, <em>And God planted a garden eastward in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>; and there He put the man whom He had formed</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332382"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;2:8</a></span>: and when he had transgressed His command He expelled him and made him to dwell over against the delights of Paradise , which clearly is the West. So, then, we worship God seeking and striving after our old fatherland. Moreover the tent of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <span class="stiki" id="note332384"><a href="../bible/lev016.htm#verse14">Leviticus&nbsp;16:14</a></span> had its veil and mercy seat  towards the East. Also the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a> as the most precious pitched their camp on the East. <span class="stiki" id="note332386"><a href="../bible/num002.htm#verse3">Numbers&nbsp;2:3</a></span> Also in the celebrated temple of Solomon the Gate of the Lord was placed eastward. Moreover Christ, when He hung on the Cross, had His face turned towards the West, and so we worship, striving after Him. And when He was received again into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> He was borne towards the East, and thus His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> worship Him, and thus He will come again in the way in which they beheld Him going towards <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> <span class="stiki" id="note332387"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;1:11</a></span>; as the Lord Himself said, <em>As the lightning comes out of the East and shines</em>  <em>even unto the West, so also shall the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> be <span class="stiki" id="note332389"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;24:27</a></span> </em>.</p>

<p>So, then, in expectation of His coming we worship towards the East. But this tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> is unwritten. For much that has been handed down to us by tradition is unwritten. </p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Concerning the holyand immaculate Mysteries of the Lord.</h2>

<p>God  Who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and altogether good and more than good, Who is goodness throughout, by reason of the exceeding riches of His goodness did not suffer Himself, that is His nature, only to be good, with no other to participate therein, but because of this He made first the spiritual and heavenly powers: next the visible and sensible <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>: next man with his spiritual and sentient nature. All things, therefore, which he made, share in His goodness in respect of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. For He Himself is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to all, since all things that are, are in Him <span class="stiki" id="note332392"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse36">Romans&nbsp;11:36</a></span>, not only because it was He that brought them out of nothing into being, but because His energy preserves and maintains all that He made: and in special the living creatures. For both in that they exist and in that they enjoy life they share in His goodness. But in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> those of them that have reason have a still greater share in that, both because of what has been already said and also because of the very reason which they possess. For they are somehow more dearly akin to Him, even though He is incomparably higher than they.</p>

<p>Man, however, being endowed with reason and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, received the power of continuous union with God through his own choice, if indeed he should abide in goodness, that is in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to his Maker. Since, however, he transgressed the command of his Creator and became liable to death and corruption, the Creator and Maker of our race, because of His bowels of compassion, took on our likeness, becoming man in all things but without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and was united to our nature. <span class="stiki" id="note332393"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse17">Hebrews&nbsp;2:17</a></span> For since He bestowed on us His own image and His own spirit and we did not keep them safe, He took Himself a share in our poor and weak nature, in order that He might cleanse us and make us incorruptible, and establish us once more as partakers of His divinity.</p>

<p>For it was fitting that not only the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of our nature should partake in the higher good but every man who wished it, and that a second birth should take place and that the nourishment should be new and suitable to the birth and thus the measure of perfection be attained. Through His birth, that is, His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and passion and resurrection, He delivered our nature from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our first parent and death and corruption, and became the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the resurrection, and made Himself the way and image and pattern, in order that we, too, following in His footsteps, may become by adoption what He is Himself by nature <span class="stiki" id="note332394"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;7:17</a></span>, sons and heirs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and joint heirs with Him.  He gave us therefore, as I said, a second birth in order that, just as we who are born of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> are in his image and are the heirs of the curse and corruption, so also being born of Him we may be in His likeness and heirs  of His incorruption and blessing and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<p>Now seeing that this <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is spiritual, it was meet that both the birth and likewise the food should be spiritual too, but since we are of a double and compound nature, it is meet that both the birth should be double and likewise the food compound. We were therefore given a birth by water and Spirit: I mean, by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> : and the food is the very bread of life, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Who came down from heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note332398"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse48">John&nbsp;6:48</a></span> For when He was about to take on Himself a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> death for our sakes, on the night on which He gave Himself up, He laid a new covenant on His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and through them on all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. In the upper chamber, then, of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and illustrious Sion, after He had eaten the ancient <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and had fulfilled the ancient covenant, He washed His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> feet  in token of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Then having broken bread He gave it to them saying, <em>Take, eat, this is My body broken for you for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em>.  Likewise also He took the cup of wine and water and gave it to them saying, <em>Drink ye all of it: for this is My blood, the blood of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> which is shed for you for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. This do ye in remembrance of Me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the death of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> and confess His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> until He come</em>. </p>

<p>If then the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is quick and energising <span class="stiki" id="note332402"><a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse12">Hebrews&nbsp;4:12</a></span>, and the Lord did all that He willed ; if He said, Let there be light and there was light, let there be a firmament and there was a firmament ; if the heavens were established by the Word of the Lord and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth ; if the heaven and the earth, water and fire and air and the whole <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of these, and, in truth, this most noble creature, man, were perfected by the Word of the Lord; if <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> of His own will became man and the pure and undefiled blood of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ever-virginal One made His flesh without the aid of seed , can He not then make the bread His body and the wine and water His blood? He said in the beginning, <em>Let the earth bring forth grass</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332407"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse11">Genesis&nbsp;1:11</a></span>, and even until this present day, when the rain comes it brings forth its proper fruits, urged on and strengthened by the divine command. God said, <em>This is My body</em>, and <em>This is My blood, and this do ye in remembrance of Me</em>. And so it is at His <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> command <em>until He come: </em>for it was in this sense that He said until He come: and the overshadowing power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> becomes through the invocation the rain to this new tillage.  For just as God made all that He made by the energy of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, so also now the energy of the Spirit performs those things that are supernatural and which it is not possible to comprehend unless by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone. <em>How shall this be</em>, said the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin, <em>seeing I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not a man? </em>And the archangel Gabriel answered her: <em>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332409"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;1:34-35</a></span> And now you ask, how the bread became Christ's body and the wine and water Christ's blood. And I say unto you, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is present and does those things which surpass reason and thought.</q></p>

<p>Further, bread and wine  are employed: for God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> man's infirmity: for in general man turns away discontentedly from what is not well-worn by custom: and so with His usual indulgence He performs His supernatural works through familiar objects: and just as, in the case of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, since it is man's custom to wash himself with water and anoint himself with oil, He connected the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit with the oil and the water and made it the water of regeneration, in like manner since it is man's custom to eat and to drink water and wine , He connected His divinity with these and made them His body and blood in order that we may rise to what is supernatural through what is familiar and natural.</p>

<p>The body which is born of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> body united with divinity, not that the body which was received up into the heavens descends, but that the bread itself and the wine are changed into God's body and blood.  But if you enquire how this happens, it is enough for you to learn that it was through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, just as the Lord took on Himself flesh that subsisted in Him and was born of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> through the Spirit. And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing further save that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and energises and is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, but the manner of this cannot be searched out.  But one can put it well thus, that just as in nature the bread by the eating and the wine and the water by the drinking are changed into the body and blood of the eater and drinker, and do not  become a different body from the former one, so the bread of the table  and the wine and water are supernaturally changed by the invocation and presence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> into the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and are not two but one  and the same.</p>

<p>Wherefore to those who partake worthily with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it is for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and for life everlasting and for the safeguarding of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; but to those who partake unworthily without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it is for chastisement and punishment, just as also the death of the Lord became to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> life and incorruption for the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessedness, while to those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and to the murderers of the Lord it is for everlasting chastisement and punishment.</p>

<p>The bread and the wine are not merely figures of the body and blood of Christ (God forbid!) but the deified body of the Lord itself: for the Lord has said, <q>This is My body,</q> not, this is a figure of My body: and <q>My blood,</q> not, a figure of My blood. And on a previous occasion He had said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <em>Except you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and drink His blood, you have no life in you. For My flesh is meat indeed and My blood is drink indeed. </em>And again, <em>He that eats Me, shall live</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332417"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse51">John&nbsp;6:51-55</a></span>. </p>

<p>Wherefore with all <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and certain <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> let us draw near and it will assuredly be to us as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, doubting nothing. Let us pay homage to it in all purity both of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body: for it is twofold. Let us draw near to it with an ardent desire, and with our hands held in the form of the cross  let us receive the body of the Crucified One: and let us apply our eyes and lips and brows and partake of the divine coal, in order that the fire of the longing, that is in us, with the additional heat derived from the coal may utterly consume our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and illumine our hearts, and that we may be inflamed and deified by the participation in the divine fire. Isaiah saw the coal. <span class="stiki" id="note332420"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;6:6</a></span> But coal is not plain wood but wood united with fire: in like manner also the bread of the communion  is not plain bread but bread united with divinity. But a body  which is united with divinity is not one nature, but has one nature belonging to the body and another belonging to the divinity that is united to it, so that the compound is not one nature but two.</p>

<p>With bread and wine Melchisedek, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, received <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> on his return from the slaughter of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note332423"><a href="../bible/gen014.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;14:18</a></span> That table pre-imaged this mystical table, just as that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was a type and image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note332424"><a href="../bible/lev014.htm">Leviticus&nbsp;xiv</a></span> <em>For you are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever after the order of Melchisedek</em>.  Of this bread the show-bread was an image.  This surely is that pure and bloodless <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which the Lord through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said is offered to Him from the rising to the setting of the sun <span class="stiki" id="note332427"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse11">Malachi&nbsp;1:11</a></span> .</p>

<p>The body and blood of Christ are making for the support of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, without being consumed or suffering corruption, not making for the draught (God forbid!) but for our being and preservation, a protection against all kinds of injury, a purging from all uncleanness: should one receive base gold, they purify it by the critical burning lest in the future we be condemned with this world. They purify from diseases and all kinds of calamities; according to the words of the divine Apostle <span class="stiki" id="note332428"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:31-32</a></span>, <em>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world</em>. This too is what he says, <em>So that he that partakes of the body and blood of Christ unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself</em>.  Being purified by this, we are united to the body of Christ and to His Spirit and become the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>This bread is the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>  of the future bread which is <span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x1F7B;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, i.e. necessary for <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. For the word <span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x1F7B;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> signifies either the future, that is Him Who is for a future age, or else Him of Whom we partake for the preservation of our <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Whether then it is in this sense or that, it is fitting to speak so of the Lord's body. For the Lord's flesh is life-giving spirit because it was conceived of the life-giving Spirit. For what is born of the Spirit is spirit. But I do not say this to take away the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body, but I wish to make clear its life-giving and divine power <span class="stiki" id="note332431"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse63">John&nbsp;6:63</a></span> .</p>

<p>But if some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> called the bread and the wine antitypes  of the body and blood of the Lord, as did the divinely inspired Basil, they said so not after the consecration but before the consecration, so calling the offering itself.</p>

<p>Participation is spoken of; for through it we partake of the divinity of Jesus. Communion, too, is spoken of, and it is an actual communion, because through it we have communion with Christ and share in His flesh and His divinity: yea, we have communion and are united with one another through it. For since we partake of one bread, we all become one body of Christ and one blood, and members one of another, being of one body with Christ.</p>

<p>With all our strength, therefore, let us beware lest we receive communion from or grant it to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; <em>Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> unto the dogs, says the Lord, neither cast ye your pearls before swine</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332433"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span>, lest we become partakers in their dishonour and condemnation. For if union is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with Christ and with one another, we are assuredly voluntarily united also with all those who partake with us. For this union is effected voluntarily and not against our inclination. <em>For we are all one body because we partake of the one bread</em>, as the divine Apostle says <span class="stiki" id="note332434"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:17</a></span> .</p>

<p>Further, antitypes of future things are spoken of, not as though they were not in reality Christ's body and blood, but that now through them we partake of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> divinity, while then we shall partake mentally  through the vision alone.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Concerning our Lord's genealogy and concerning the holy Mother of God. </h2>

<p>Concerning the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and much-lauded ever-virgin one, Mary, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, we have said something in the preceding chapters, bringing forward what was most opportune, viz., that strictly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> she is and is called the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. Now let us fill up the blanks. For she being pre-ordained by the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> prescient counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and imaged forth and proclaimed in diverse images and discourses of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, sprang at the pre-determined time from the root of David, according to the promises that were made to him. <em>For the Lord has <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, He says in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to David, He will not turn from it: of the fruit of Your body will I set upon Your throne</em>.  And again, <em>Once have I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> by My <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, that I will not lie unto David. His seed shall endure for ever, and His throne as the sun before Me. It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in heaven</em>.  And Isaiah says: <em>And there shall come out a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332439"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;11:1</a></span> .</p>

<p>But that Joseph is descended from the tribe of David is expressly demonstrated by Matthew and Luke, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>. But Matthew derives Joseph from David through Solomon, while Luke does so through Nathan; while over the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin's origin both pass in silence.</p>

<p>One ought to remember that it was not the custom of the Hebrews nor of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> to give genealogies of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; and the law was to prevent one tribe seeking wives from another.  And so since Joseph was descended from the tribe of David and was a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man (for this the divine <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> testifies), he would not have espoused the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin contrary to the law; he would not have taken her unless she had been of the same tribe.  It was sufficient, therefore, to demonstrate the descent of Joseph.</p>

<p>One ought also to observe  this, that the law was that when a man died without seed, this man's brother should take to wife the wife of the dead man and raise up seed to his brother. <span class="stiki" id="note332443"><a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy&nbsp;25:5</a></span> The offspring, therefore, belonged by nature to the second, that is, to him that begot it, but by law to the dead.</p>

<p>Born then of the line of Nathan, the son of David, Levi begot Melchi  and Panther: Panther begot Barpanther, so called. This Barpanther begot Joachim: Joachim begot the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> .  And of the line of Solomon, the son of David, Mathan had a wife  of whom he begot Jacob. Now on the death of Mathan, Melchi, of the tribe of Nathan, the son of Levi and brother of Panther, married the wife of Mathan, Jacob's mother, of whom he begot Heli. Therefore Jacob and Heli became brothers on the mother's side, Jacob being of the tribe of Solomon and Heli of the tribe of Nathan. Then Heli of the tribe of Nathan died childless, and Jacob his brother, of the tribe of Solomon, took his wife and raised up seed to his brother and begot Joseph. Joseph, therefore, is by nature the son of Jacob, of the line of Solomon, but by law he is the son of Heli of the line of Nathan.</p>

<p>Joachim then  took to wife that revered and praiseworthy <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, Anna. But just as the earlier Anna <span class="stiki" id="note332449"><a href="../bible/1sa001.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;1:2</a></span>, who was barren, bore Samuel by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and by promise, so also this Anna by supplication and promise from God bare the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> in order that she might not even in this be behind the matrons of fame.  Accordingly it was <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (for this is the interpretation of Anna) that bore the lady: (for she became <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the Lady of all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things in becoming the Mother of the Creator). Further, Joachim  was born in the house of the <em>Probatica</em> , and was brought up to the temple. Then planted in the House of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and increased by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, like a fruitful olive tree, she became the home of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, turning her mind away from every secular and carnal desire, and thus keeping her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as well as her body virginal, as was meet for her who was to receive God into her bosom: for as He is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, He finds rest among the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.  Thus, therefore, she strove after <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and was declared a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and wonderful temple fit for the most high God.</p>

<p>Moreover, since the enemy of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was keeping a watchful eye on <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Isaiah, who said, <em>Behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive and bare a Son and shall call His name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, which is, being interpreted, 'God with us</em> ,' in order that <em>he who takes the wise in their own craftiness</em> may deceive him who always <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> in his wisdom, the maiden is given in marriage to Joseph by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, a new book to him who is versed in letters <span class="stiki" id="note332456"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;29:11</a></span>: but the marriage was both the protection of the virgin and the delusion of him who was keeping a watchful eye on <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. But when the fullness of time had come, the messenger of the Lord was sent to her, with the good news of our Lord's conception. And thus she conceived the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the hypostatic power of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <em>not of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of man</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332457"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;1:13</a></span>, that is to say, by connection and seed, but by the good pleasure of the Father and co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. She ministered to the Creator in that He was created, to the Fashioner in that He was fashioned, and to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and God in that He was made flesh and became man from her pure and immaculate flesh and blood, satisfying the debt of the first mother. For just as the latter was formed from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> without connection, so also did the former bring forth the new Adam, who was brought forth in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of parturition and above the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of generation.</p>

<p>For He who was of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, yet without mother, was born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> without a father's co-operation. And so far as He was born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, His birth was in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of parturition, while so far as He had no father, His birth was above the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of generation: and in that it was at the usual time (for He was born on the completion of the ninth month when the tenth was just beginning), His birth was in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of parturition, while in that it was painless it was above the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of generation. For, as pleasure did not precede it, pain did not follow it, according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who says, <em>Before she travailed, she brought forth, and again, before her pain came she was delivered of a man-child</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332458"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;66:7</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> incarnate, therefore, was born of her, not a divinely-inspired  man but God incarnate; not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> anointed with energy but by the presence of the anointing One in His completeness, so that the Anointer became man and the Anointed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not by a change of nature but by union in subsistence. For the Anointer and the Anointed were one and the same, anointing in the capacity of God Himself as man. Must there not therefore be a <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> who bore God incarnate? Assuredly she who played the part of the Creator's servant and mother is in all strictness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in reality God's Mother and Lady and Queen over all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things. But just as He who was conceived kept her who conceived still virgin, in like manner also He who was born preserved her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> intact, only passing through her and keeping her closed. <span class="stiki" id="note332460"><a href="../bible/eze044.htm#verse2">Ezekiel&nbsp;44:2</a></span> The conception, indeed, was through the sense of hearing, but the birth through the usual path by which children come, although some tell tales of His birth through the side of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. For it was not impossible for Him to have come by this gate, without injuring her seal in anyway.</p>

<p>The ever-virgin One thus remains even after the birth still virgin, having never at any time up till death consorted with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For although it is written, <em>And <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her not till she had brought forth her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> Son</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332461"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;1:25</a></span>, yet note that he who is first-begotten is <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> even if he is only-begotten. For the word <q><a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a></q> means that he was born first but does not at all suggest the birth of others. And the word <q>till</q> signifies the limit of the appointed time but does not exclude the time thereafter. For the Lord says, <em>And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world</em> , not meaning thereby that He will be separated from us after the completion of the age. The divine apostle, indeed, says, <em>And so shall we ever be with the Lord</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332463"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:17</a></span>, meaning after the general resurrection.</p>

<p>For could it be possible that she, who had borne God and from experience of the subsequent events had come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, should receive the embrace of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. God forbid! It is not the part of a chaste mind to think such thoughts, far less to commit such acts.</p>

<p>But this blessed <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who was deemed worthy of gifts that are supernatural, suffered those pains, which she escaped at the birth, in the hour of the passion, enduring from motherly sympathy the rending of the bowels, and when she beheld Him, Whom she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be God by the manner of His generation, killed as a malefactor, her thoughts pierced her as a sword, and this is the meaning of this verse: <em>Yea, a sword shall pierce through your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332464"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;2:35</a></span>.  But the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the resurrection transforms the pain, proclaiming Him, Who died in the flesh, to be God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Concerning the honourdue to the Saints and their remains.</h2>

<p>To the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> must be paid as friends of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as sons and heirs of God: in the words of John the theologian and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, <em>As many as received Him, to them gave He power to became sons of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332466"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;1:12</a></span> <em>So that they are no longer servants, but sons: and if sons, also heirs, heirs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and joint heirs with Christ</em> : and the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> says to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <em>You are My friends</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332468"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;15:14</a></span> . <em> Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what his lord does</em>.  And further, if the Creator and Lord of all things is called also King of Kings and Lord of Lords <span class="stiki" id="note332470"><a href="../bible/rev019.htm#verse16">Revelation&nbsp;19:16</a></span> and God of Gods, surely also the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are gods and lords and kings. For of these God is and is called God and Lord and King. <em>For I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a></em>, He said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <em>the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332471"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;3:6</a></span> And God made <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> a god to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>.  Now I mean gods and kings and lords not in nature, but as rulers and masters of their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and as preserving a truthful likeness to the divine image according to which they were made (for the image of a king is also called king), and as being united to God of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> and receiving Him as an indweller and becoming by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through participation with Him what He is Himself by nature. Surely, then, the worshippers and friends and sons of God are to be held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>? For the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> shown to the most thoughtful of fellow-servants is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of good feeling towards the common Master. </p>

<p>These are made treasuries and pure habitations of God: <em>For I will dwell in them, </em>said <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>and walk in them, and I will be their God</em>.  The <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> likewise says that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just are in God's hand <span class="stiki" id="note332475"><a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse1">Wisdom&nbsp;3:1</a></span> and death cannot lay hold of them. For death is rather the sleep of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> than their death. <em>For they travailed in this life and shall to the end</em> , and <em>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a></em>.  What then, is more precious than to be in the hand of God? For God is Life and Light, and those who are in God's hand are in life and light.</p>

<p>Further, that God dwelt even in their bodies in spiritual wise , the Apostle tells us, saying, <em>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your bodies are the temples of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> dwelling in you?</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332479"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:16</a></span>, and The <em>Lord is that Spirit</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332480"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span>, and <em>If any one destroy the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, him will God destroy</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332481"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> Surely, then, we must ascribe <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the living temples of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the living tabernacles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These while they lived stood with confidence before God.</p>

<p>The Master Christ made the remains of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to be fountains of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to us, pouring forth manifold blessings and abounding in oil of sweet fragrance: and let no one disbelieve this.  For if water burst in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> from the steep and solid rock at <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> <span class="stiki" id="note332483"><a href="../bible/exo017.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;17:6</a></span> and from the jaw-bone of an ass to quench Samson's thirst <span class="stiki" id="note332484"><a href="../bible/jdg015.htm#verse17">Judges&nbsp;15:17</a></span>, is it incredible that fragrant oil should burst forth from the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> remains? By no means, at least to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which He accords His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</p>

<p>In the law every one who touches a dead body was considered impure <span class="stiki" id="note332485"><a href="../bible/num019.htm#verse11">Numbers&nbsp;19:11</a></span>, but these are not dead. For from the time when He that is Himself life and the Author of life was reckoned among the dead, we do not call those dead who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection and in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on Him. For how could a dead body work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>? How, therefore, are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> driven off by them, diseases dispelled, sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> made well, the blind restored to sight, <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> purified, <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> and troubles overcome, and how does every good gift from the Father of lights <span class="stiki" id="note332486"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse17">James&nbsp;1:17</a></span> come down through them to those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with sure <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? How much labour would you not undergo to find a patron to introduce you to a mortal king and speak to him on your behalf? Are not those, then, worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> who are the patrons of the whole race, and make intercession to God for us? Yea, verily, we ought to give <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to them by raising temples to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their name, bringing them fruit-offerings, honouring their memories and taking spiritual delight in them, in order that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of those who call on us may be ours, that in our attempts at worship we may not on the contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them offense. For those who worship God will take pleasure in those things whereby God is worshipped, while His shield-bearers will be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> at those things wherewith God is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.

Let us raise monuments to them and visible images, and let us ourselves become, through imitation of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, living monuments and images of them. Let us give <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to her who bore God as being strictly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>.

<h2>Chapter 16. Concerning Images. </h2>

<p>But since some  find fault with us for worshipping and honouring the image of our Saviour and that of our Lady, and those, too, of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and servants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let them remember that in the beginning God created man after His own image. <span class="stiki" id="note332498"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> On what grounds, then, do we show reverence to each other unless because we are made after God's image? For as Basil, that much-versed expounder of divine things, says, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> given to the image passes over to the prototype.  Now a prototype is that which is imaged, from which the derivative is obtained. Why was it that the Mosaic people honoured on all hands the tabernacle <span class="stiki" id="note332500"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse10">Exodus&nbsp;33:10</a></span> which bore an image and type of heavenly things, or rather of the whole creation? God indeed said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <em>Look that thou make them after their pattern which was showed you in the mount</em>.  The Cherubim, too, which o'ershadow the mercy seat, are they not the work of men's hands <span class="stiki" id="note332502"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse18">Exodus&nbsp;25:18</a></span>? What, further, is the celebrated temple at Jerusalem? Is it not hand-made and fashioned by the skill of men <span class="stiki" id="note332503"><a href="../bible/1ki008.htm">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;viii</a></span>?</p>

<p>Moreover the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> blames those who worship graven images, but also those who <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. The Greeks <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>: but the Greeks to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the Greeks was rejected and condemned, but the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the just was very acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, and <em>God smelled a sweet savour</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332504"><a href="../bible/gen008.htm#verse21">Genesis&nbsp;8:21</a></span>, receiving the fragrance of the right choice and good-will towards Him. And so the graven images of the Greeks, since they were images of deities, were rejected and forbidden.</p>

<p>But besides this who can make an imitation of the invisible, incorporeal, uncircumscribed, formless God? Therefore to give form to the Deity is the height of folly and impiety. And hence it is that in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> the use of images was not common. But after God  in His bowels of pity became in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> man for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, not as He was seen by <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in the semblance of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor as He was seen by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but in being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> man, and after He lived upon the earth and dwelt among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <span class="stiki" id="note332506"><a href="../bible/bar003.htm#verse38">Baruch&nbsp;3:38</a></span>, worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, suffered, was crucified, rose again and was taken back to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, since all these things actually took place and were seen by men, they were written for the remembrance and instruction of us who were not alive at that time in order that though we saw not, we may still, hearing and believing, obtain the blessing of the Lord. But seeing that not every one has a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of letters nor time for reading, the Fathers gave their sanction to depicting these events on images as being acts of great heroism, in order that they should form a concise memorial of them. Often, doubtless, when we have not the Lord's passion in mind and see the image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> crucifixion, His saving passion is brought back to remembrance, and we fall down and worship not the material but that which is imaged: just as we do not worship the material of which the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> are made, nor the material of the Cross, but that which these typify. For wherein does the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, that typifies the Lord, differ from a cross that does not do so? It is just the same also in the case of the Mother of the Lord. For the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which we give to her is referred to Him Who was made of her incarnate. And similarly also the brave acts of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men stir us up to be brave and to emulate and imitate their valour and to glorify God. For as we said, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> that is given to the best of fellow-servants is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of good-will towards our common Lady, and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> rendered to the image passes over to the prototype.  But this is an unwritten tradition , just as is also the worshipping towards the East and the worship of the Cross, and very many other similar things.</p>

<p>A certain tale , too, is told , how that when Augarus  was king over the city of the <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessenes</a>, he sent a portrait painter to paint a likeness of the Lord, and when the painter could not paint because of the brightness that shone from His countenance, the Lord Himself put a garment over His own divine and life-giving face and impressed on it an image of Himself and sent this to Augarus, to satisfy thus his desire.</p>

<p>Moreover that the Apostles handed down much that was unwritten, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, tells us in these words: <em>Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you have been taught of us, whether by word or by epistle</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332512"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> And to the Corinthians he writes, <em>Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the traditions as I have delivered them to you</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332513"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:2</a></span> .</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Concerning Scripture. </h2>

<p>It is one and the same God Whom both the Old and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> proclaim, Who is praised and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the Trinity: <em>I have come</em>, says the Lord, <em>not to destroy the law but to fulfil it</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332515"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span> For He Himself worked out our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for which all Scripture and all <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> exists. And again, <em>Search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> for they are they that testify of Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332516"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;5:39</a></span> And the Apostle says, <em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who at sundry times and in diverse manners spoke in time past unto the fathers by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, has in these last days spoken unto us by His Son</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332517"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;1:1-2</a></span> Through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, therefore, both the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and pastors and teachers, spoke.</p>

<p>All Scripture, then, is <em>given by inspiration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and is also assuredly profitable</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332518"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:16</a></span> Wherefore to search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> is a work most fair and most profitable for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For just as the tree planted by the channels of waters, so also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> watered by the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> is enriched and gives fruit in its season , viz. <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> belief, and is adorned with evergreen leafage, I mean, actions pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For through the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> we are trained to action that is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and untroubled <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. For in these we find both exhortation to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and dissuasion from every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. If, therefore, we are lovers of learning, we shall also be learned in many things. For by care and toil and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God the Giver, all things are accomplished. <em>For every one that asks receives, and he that seeks finds, and to him that knocks it shall be opened</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332520"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;11:10</a></span> Wherefore let us knock at that very fair garden of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, so fragrant and sweet and blooming, with its varied sounds of spiritual and divinely-inspired birds ringing all round our ears, laying hold of our hearts, comforting the mourner, pacifying the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and filling him with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> everlasting: which sets our mind on the gold-gleaming, brilliant back of the divine dove , whose bright pinions bear up to the only-begotten Son and Heir of the Husbandman <span class="stiki" id="note332522"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;21:37</a></span> of that spiritual Vineyard and bring us through Him to the Father of Lights. <span class="stiki" id="note332523"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse17">James&nbsp;1:17</a></span> But let us not knock carelessly but rather <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> and constantly: lest knocking we grow weary. For thus it will be opened to us. If we read once or twice and do not understand what we read, let us not grow weary, but let us persist, let us talk much, let us enquire. For <em>ask your Father</em>, he says, <em>and He will show you: your elders and they will tell you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332524"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse7">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:7</a></span> For <em>there is not in every man that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332525"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:7</a></span> Let us draw of the fountain of the garden perennial and purest waters springing into life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note332526"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;4:14</a></span> Here let us luxuriate, let us revel insatiate: for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> possess inexhaustible <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But if we are able to pluck anything profitable from outside sources, there is nothing to forbid that. Let us become tried money-dealers, heaping up the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and pure gold and discarding the spurious. Let us keep the fairest sayings but let us throw to the dogs absurd gods and strange myths: for we might prevail most mightily against them through themselves.</p>

<p>Observe, further , that there are two and twenty books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, one for each letter of the Hebrew tongue. For there are twenty-two letters of which five are double, and so they come to be twenty-seven. For the letters Caph, Mem, Nun, Pe , Sade are double. And thus the number of the books in this way is twenty-two, but is found to be twenty-seven because of the double character of five. For Ruth is joined on to Judges, and the Hebrews count them one book: the first and second books of Kings are counted one: and so are the third and fourth books of Kings: and also the first and second of Paraleipomena: and the first and second of Esdra. In this way, then, the books are collected together in four Pentateuchs and two others remain over, to form thus the canonical books. Five of them are of the Law, viz. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. This which is the code of the Law, constitutes the first Pentateuch. Then comes another Pentateuch, the so-called Grapheia , or as they are called by some, the Hagiographa, which are the following: Jesus the Son of Nave , Judges along with Ruth, first and second Kings, which are one book, third and fourth Kings, which are one book, and the two books of the Paraleipomena  which are one book. This is the second Pentateuch. The third Pentateuch is the books in verse, viz. Job, Psalms, Proverbs of Solomon, Ecclesiastes of Solomon and the Song of Songs of Solomon. The fourth Pentateuch is the Prophetical books, viz the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> constituting one book, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel. Then come the two books of Esdra made into one, and Esther.  There are also the Panaretus, that is the Wisdom of Solomon, and the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, which was published in Hebrew by the father of Sirach, and afterwards translated into Greek by his grandson, Jesus, the Son of Sirach. These are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and noble, but are not counted nor were they placed in the ark.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> contains four <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>, that according to <a href="../bible/mat000.htm">Matthew</a>, that according to <a href="../bible/mar000.htm">Mark</a>, that according to <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">Luke</a>, that according to <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">John</a>: the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Holy Apostles</a> by Luke the Evangelist: seven <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">catholic epistles</a>, viz. one of James, two of Peter, three of John, one of Jude: fourteen letters of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>: the <a href="../bible/rev000.htm">Revelation of John the Evangelist</a>: the Canons  of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> , by Clement.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Regarding the things said concerning Christ.</h2>

<p>The things said concerning Christ fall into four generic modes. For some fit Him even before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, others in the union, others after the union, and others after the resurrection. Also of those that refer to the period before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> there are six modes: for some of them declare the union of nature and the identity in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as this, <em>I and My Father are one</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332535"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span>: also this, <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father</em> : and this, <em>Who being in the form of God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332537"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6</a></span>, and so forth. Others declare the perfection of subsistence, as these, <em><a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>, and <em>the Express Image of His person</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332538"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews&nbsp;1:3</a></span>, and <em>Messenger of great counsel, Wonderful Counsellor</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332539"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;9:6</a></span>, and the like.</p>

<p>Again, others declare the indwelling  of the subsistences in one another, as, <em>I am in the Father and the Father in Me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332541"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;14:10</a></span>; and the inseparable foundation , as, for instance, the Word, Wisdom, Power, Effulgence. For the word is inseparably established in the mind (and it is the essential mind that I mean), and so also is wisdom, and power in him that is powerful, and effulgence in the light, all springing forth from these. </p>

<p>And others make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the fact of His origin from the Father as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for instance <em>My Father is greater than I</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332544"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span> For from Him He derives both His being and all that He has : His being was by generative and not by creative means, as, <em>I came forth from the Father and have come</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332546"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;16:28</a></span>, and <em>I live by the Father </em>. But all that He has is not His by free gift or by teaching, but in a causal sense, as, <em>The Son can do nothing of Himself but what He sees the Father do</em>.  For if the Father is not, neither is the Son. For the Son is of the Father and in the Father and with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and not after  the Father. In like manner also what He does is of Him and with Him. For there is one and the same, not similar but the same, will and energy and power in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, other things are said as though the Father's good-will was fulfilled  through His energy, and not as through an instrument or a servant, but as through His essential and hypostatic Word and Wisdom and Power, because but one action  is observed in Father and Son, as for example, <em>All things were made by Him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332552"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse42">John&nbsp;11:42</a></span>, and <em>He sent His Word and healed them</em> , and <em>That they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You have sent Me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332554"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;17:2</a></span> .</p>

<p>Some, again, have a prophetic sense, and of these some are in the future tense: for instance, <em>He shall come openly</em> , and this from Zechariah, <em>Behold, your King comes unto you</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332556"><a href="../bible/zec009.htm#verse9">Zechariah&nbsp;9:9</a></span>, and this from Micah, <em>Behold, the Lord comes out of His place and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332557"><a href="../bible/mic001.htm#verse3">Micah&nbsp;1:3</a></span> But others, though future, are put in the past tense, as, for instance, <em>This is our God: Therefore He was seen upon the earth and dwelt among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note332558"><a href="../bible/bar003.htm#verse38">Baruch&nbsp;3:38</a></span>, and <em>The Lord created me in the beginning of His ways for His works</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332559"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;8:22</a></span>, and <em>Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, anointed you with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above your fellows</em> , and such like.</p>

<p>The things said, then, that refer to the period before the union will be applicable to Him even after the union: but those that refer to the period after the union will not be applicable at all before the union, unless indeed in a prophetic sense, as we said. Those that refer to the time of the union have three modes. For when our discourse deals with the higher aspect, we speak of the deification of the flesh, and His assumption of the Word and exceeding exaltation, and so forth, making manifest the riches that are added to the flesh from the union and natural conjunction with the most high <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>. And when our discourse deals with the lower aspect, we speak of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, His becoming man, His emptying of Himself, His poverty, His humility. For these and such like are imposed upon the Word and God through His admixture with humanity. When again we keep both sides in view at the same time, we speak of union, community, anointing, natural conjunction, conformation and the like. The former two modes, then, have their reason in this third mode. For through the union it is made clear what either has obtained from the intimate junction with and permeation through the other. For through the union  in subsistence the flesh is said to be deified and to become God and to be equally God with the Word; and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> is said to be made flesh, and to become man, and is called creature and last <span class="stiki" id="note332562"><a href="../bible/isa048.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;48:12</a></span>: not in the sense that the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> are converted into one compound nature (for it is not possible for the opposite natural qualities to exist at the same time in one nature) , but in the sense that the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> are united in subsistence and permeate one another without confusion or transmutation. The permeation  moreover did not come of the flesh but of the divinity: for it is impossible that the flesh should permeate through the divinity: but the divine nature once permeating through the flesh gave also to the flesh the same ineffable power of permeation ; and this indeed is what we call union.</p>

<p>Note, too, that in the case of the first and second modes of those that belong to the period of the union, reciprocation is observed. For when we speak about the flesh, we use the terms deification and assumption of the Word and exceeding exaltation and anointing. For these are derived from divinity, but are observed in connection with the flesh. And when we speak about the Word, we use the terms emptying, <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, becoming man, humility and the like: and these, as we said, are imposed on the Word and God through the flesh. For He endured these things in person of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.</p>

<p>Of the things that refer to the period after the union there are three modes. The first declares His divine nature, as, <em>I am in the Father and the Father in Me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332566"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;14:1</a></span>, and <em>I and the Father are one</em> : and all those things which are affirmed of Him before His assumption of humanity, these will be affirmed of Him even after His assumption of humanity, with this exception, that He did not assume the flesh and its natural properties.</p>

<p>The second declares His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as, <em>Now ye seek to kill Me, a man that has told you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></em> , and <em>Even so must the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> be lifted up</em> , and the like.</p>

<p>Further, of the statements made and written about Christ the Saviour after the manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whether they deal with sayings or actions, there are six modes. For some of them were done or said naturally in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>; for instance, His birth from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, His growth and progress with age, His hunger, thirst, weariness, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, sleep, piercing with nails, death and all such like natural and innocent <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.  For in all these there is a mixture of the divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, although they are held to belong in reality to the body, the divine suffering none of these, but procuring through them our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>Others are of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of ascription , as Christ's question, <em>Where have ye laid Lazarus</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332572"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;11:34</a></span>? His running to the fig-tree, His shrinking, that is, His drawing back, His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, and His making <em>as though He would have gone further</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332573"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;24:28</a></span> For neither as God nor as man was He in need of these or similar things, but only because His form was that of a man as necessity and expediency demanded.  For example, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> was to show that He is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He gives <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the Father as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Himself : and the question was not put in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> but to show that He is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> man as well as God ; and the drawing back is to teach us not to be impetuous nor to give ourselves up.</p>

<p>Others again are said in the manner of association and relation , as, <em>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken Me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332578"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;27:46</a></span> <em>? </em>and <em>He has made Him to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note332579"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:21</a></span> <em>, and being made a curse for us</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332580"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians&nbsp;3:13</a></span>; also, <em>Then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332581"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:28</a></span> For neither as God nor as man  was He ever forsaken by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor did He become <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or a curse, nor did He require to be made subject to the Father. For as God He is equal to the Father and not opposed to Him nor subjected to Him; and as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He was never at any time disobedient to His Begetter to make it necessary for Him to make Him subject.  Appropriating, then, our person and ranking Himself with us, He used these words. For we are bound in the fetters of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the curse as faithless and disobedient, and therefore forsaken.</p>

<p>Others are said by reason of distinction in thought. For if you divide in thought things that are inseparable in actual <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to cut the flesh from the Word, the terms  'servant' and '<a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>' are used of Him, for indeed He was of a subject and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> nature, and except that it was united with <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, His flesh was servile and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.  But because of the union in subsistence with <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> it was neither servile nor <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. In this way, too, He called the Father His God.</p>

<p>Others again are for the purpose of revealing Him to us and strengthening our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as, <em>And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had with You, before the world was</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332585"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;17:5</a></span> For He Himself was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> and is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, but His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was not manifested nor confirmed to us. Also that which the apostle said, <em>Declared to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with power, according to the spirit of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, by the resurrection from the dead</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332586"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;1:4</a></span> For by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and the resurrection and the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> it was manifested and confirmed to the world that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.  And this too <span class="stiki" id="note332588"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse40">Luke&nbsp;2:40</a></span>, <em>The Child grew in wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></em>. </p>

<p>Others again have reference to His appropriation of the personal life of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in numbering Himself among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as He says to the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <em>You worship ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what: we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what we worship, far <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note332590"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;4:22</a></span> .</p>

<p>The third mode is one which declares the one subsistence and brings out the dual nature: for instance, <em>And I live by the Father: so he that eats Me, even he shall live by Me</em>.  And this: <em>I go to My Father and you see Me no more</em>.  And this: <em>They would not have crucified the Lord of Glory</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332593"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> And this: <em>And no man has ascended up to heaven but He that came down from heaven, even the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> which is in heaven</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332594"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;3:13</a></span>, and such like.</p>

<p>Again of the affirmations that refer to the period after the resurrection some are suitable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as, <em>Baptizing them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note332595"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span>, for here 'Son' is clearly used as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; also this, <em>And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world</em> , and other similar ones. For He is with us as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Others are suitable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as, <em>They held Him by the feet</em> , and <em>There they will see Me</em> , and so forth.</p>

<p>Further, of those referring to the period after the Resurrection that are suitable to man there are different modes. For some did actually take place, yet not according to nature , but according to dispensation, in order to confirm the fact that the very body, which suffered, rose again; such are the weals, the eating and the drinking after the resurrection. Others took place actually and naturally, as changing from place to place without trouble and passing in through closed gates. Others have the character of simulation , as, <em>He made as though He would have gone further</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332601"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;24:28</a></span> Others are appropriate to the double nature, as, <em>I ascend unto My Father and your Father, and My God and your God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332602"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span>, and <em>The King of Glory shall come in</em> , and <em>He sat down on the right hand of the majesty on High</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332604"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews&nbsp;1:3</a></span> Finally others are to be understood as though He were ranking Himself with us, in the manner of separation in pure thought, as, <em>My God and your God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332605"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span> .</p>

<p>Those then that are sublime must be assigned to the divine nature, which is superior to passion and body: and those that are <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> must be ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and those that are common must be attributed to the compound, that is, the one Christ, Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And it should be understood that both belong to one and the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our Lord. For if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is proper to each, and perceive that both are performed by one and the same, we shall have the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and shall not go astray. And from all these the difference between the united natures is recognised, and the fact  that, as the most godly Cyril says, they are not identical in the natural quality of their divinity and humanity. But yet there is but one Son and Christ and Lord: and as He is one, He has also but one person, the unity in subsistence being in nowise broken up into parts by the recognition of the difference of the natures.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. That God  is not the cause of evils.</h2>

<p>It is to be observed  that it is the custom in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> to speak of God's permission as His energy, as when the apostle says in the Epistle to the Romans, <em>Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and another unto dishonour</em>  <em>? </em>And for this reason, that He Himself makes this or that. For He is Himself alone the Maker of all things; yet it is not He Himself that fashions noble or ignoble things, but the personal choice of each one.  And this is manifest from what the same Apostle says in the Second Epistle to Timothy, <em>In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth: and some to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and some to dishonour. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332611"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:20-21</a></span> And it is evident that the purification must be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>: for <em>if a man</em>, he says, <em>purge himself. </em>And the consequent antistrophe responds, <q>If a man purge not himself he will be a vessel to dishonour, unmeet for the master's use and fit only to be broken in pieces.</q> Wherefore this passage that we have quoted and this, <em>God has concluded them all in unbelief</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332612"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;11:32</a></span>, and this, <em>God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear</em> , all these must be understood not as though God Himself were energising, but as though God were permitting, both because of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> and because goodness <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no compulsion.</p>

<p>His permission, therefore, is usually spoken of in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> as His energy and work. Nay, even when He says that <em>God creates <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things</em>, and that <em>there is no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in a city that the Lord has not done</em>, he does not mean by these words <span class="stiki" id="note332614"><a href="../bible/amo003.htm#verse6">Amos&nbsp;3:6</a></span> that the Lord is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but the word '<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ' is used in two ways, with two meanings. For sometimes it means what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by nature, and this is the opposite of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and sometimes it means that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and oppressive to our sensation, that is to say, afflictions and calamities. Now these are seemingly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> because they are painful, but in reality are good. For to those who understand they became ambassadors of conversion and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that of these God is the Author.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, to be observed that of these, too, we are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: for involuntary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are the offspring of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> ones. </p>

<p>This also should be recognised, that it is usual in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> for some things that ought to be considered as effects to be stated in a causal sense , as, <em>Against You, You only, have I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and done this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in Your sight, that You might be justified when You speak, and prevail when You judge</em>.  For the sinner did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in order that God might prevail, nor again did God require our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in order that He might by it be revealed as victor.  For above comparison He wins the victor's prize against all, even against those who are sinless, being Maker, incomprehensible, uncreated, and possessing natural and not adventitious <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But it is because when we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> God is not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against us; and when He pardons the penitent He is shown victor over our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. But it is not for this that we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but because the thing so turns out. It is just as if one were sitting at work and a friend stood near by, and one said, My friend came in order that I might do no work that day. The friend, however, was not present in order that the man should do no work, but such was the result. For being occupied with receiving his friend he did not work. These things, too, are spoken of as effects because affairs so turned out. Moreover, God does not wish that He alone should be just, but that all should, so far as possible, be made like Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. That there are not two Kingdoms.</h2>

<p>That there are not two kingdoms , one good and one bad, we shall see from this. For good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are opposed to one another and mutually destructive, and cannot exist in one another or with one another. Each of them, therefore, in its own division will belong to the whole, and first  they will be circumscribed, not by the whole alone but also each of them by part of the whole.</p>

<p>Next I ask , who it is that assigns  to each its place. For they will not affirm that they have come to a friendly agreement with, or been reconciled to, one another. For <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> when it is at peace with, and reconciled to, goodness, nor is goodness good when it is on amicable terms with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But if He Who has marked off to each of these its own sphere of action is something different from them, He must the rather be God.</p>

<p>One of two things indeed is necessary, either that they come in contact with and destroy one another, or that there exists some intermediate place where neither goodness nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> exists, separating both from one another, like a partition. And so there will be no longer two but three kingdoms.</p>

<p>Again, one of these alternatives is necessary, either that they are at peace, which is quite incompatible with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (for that which is at peace is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>), or they are at strife, which is incompatible with goodness (for that which is at strife is not perfectly good), or the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is at strife and the good does not retaliate, but is destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or they are ever in trouble and distress , which is not a mark of goodness. There is, therefore, but one kingdom, delivered from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>But if this is so, they say, whence comes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ? For it is quite impossible that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should originate from goodness. We answer then, that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is nothing else than absence of goodness and a lapsing  from what is natural into what is unnatural: for nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is natural. For all things, whatsoever God made, are very good <span class="stiki" id="note332627"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis&nbsp;1:31</a></span>, so far as they were made: if, therefore, they remain just as they were created, they are very good, but when they voluntarily depart from what is natural and turn to what is unnatural, they slip into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>By nature, therefore, all things are servants of the Creator and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him. Whenever, then, any of His creatures voluntarily rebels and becomes disobedient to his Maker, he introduces <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> into himself. For <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not any <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> nor a property of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but an accident, that is, a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> deviation from what is natural into what is unnatural, which is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>Whence, then, comes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> ? It is an invention of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, then, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? In so far as he was brought into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> he is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> but good. For he was created by his Maker a bright and very brilliant <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, endowed with <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> as being rational. But he voluntarily departed from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that is natural and came into the darkness of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, being far removed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who alone is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and can give life and light. For from Him every good thing derives its goodness, and so far as it is separated from Him in will (for it is not in place), it falls into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. The purpose for which God in His foreknowledge created persons who would sin and not repent.</h2>

<p>God in His goodness  brought what exists into being out of nothing, and has foreknowledge of what will exist in the future. If, therefore, they were not to exist in the future, they would neither be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the future nor would they be foreknown. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is of what exists and foreknowledge is of what will surely exist in the future. For simple being comes first and then good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> being. But if the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of those, who through the goodness of God are in the future to exist, were to be prevented by the fact that they were to become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of their own choice, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> would have prevailed over the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore God makes all His works good, but each becomes of its own choice good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Although, then, the Lord said, <em>Good were it for that man that he had never been born</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332631"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse21">Mark&nbsp;14:21</a></span>, He said it in condemnation not of His own creation but of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which His own creation had acquired by his own choice and through his own heedlessness. For the heedlessness that marks man's judgment made His Creator's beneficence of no profit to him. It is just as if any one, when he had obtained riches and dominion from a king, were to lord it over his benefactor, who, when he has worsted him, will punish him as he deserves, if he should see him keeping hold of the sovereignty to the end.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Concerning the law of God and the law of sin.</h2>

<p>The Deity is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and more than good, and so is His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wishes is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Moreover the precept, which teaches this, is law, that we, holding by it, may walk in light <span class="stiki" id="note332632"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:7</a></span>: and the transgression of this precept is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this continues to exist on account of the assault of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and our unconstrained and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> reception of it. <span class="stiki" id="note332633"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;7:23</a></span> And this, too, is called law <span class="stiki" id="note332634"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;7:25</a></span> .</p>

<p>And so the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, settling in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, draws it towards itself and pricks our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. And our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, too, is called a law of our mind. Further, the assault of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one, that is the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, settling in the members of our flesh, makes its assault upon us through it. For by once voluntarily transgressing the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and receiving the assault of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one, we gave entrance to it, being sold by ourselves to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore our body is readily impelled to it. And so the savour and perception of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is stored up in our body, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and pleasure of the body, is law in the members of our flesh.</p>

<p>Therefore the law of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that is, the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, sympathises with the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, the precept, and makes that its will. But the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> , that is to say, the assault made through the law that is in our members, or through the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and inclination and movement of the body and of the irrational part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is in opposition to the law of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that is to <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and takes me captive (even though I make the law of God my will and set my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> on it, and make not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> my will), by reason of commixture : and through the softness of pleasure and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the body and of the irrational part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as I said, it leads me astray and induces me to become the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <em>what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh </em>(for He assumed flesh but not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>) <em>condemned <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note332637"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;8:3-4</a></span> . <em> For the Spirit helps our infirmities</em>  and affords power to the law of our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, against the law that is in our members. For the verse, <em>we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings that cannot be uttered</em> , itself teaches us what to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for. Hence it is impossible to carry out the precepts of the Lord except by patience and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Against the Jews on the question of the Sabbath.</h2>

<p>The seventh day is called the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and signifies rest. For in it God rested from all His works <span class="stiki" id="note332640"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;2:2</a></span>, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> says: and so the number of the days goes up to seven and then circles back again and begins at the first. This is the precious number with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, God having ordained that it should be held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and that in no chance fashion but with the imposition of most heavy penalties for the transgression.  And it was not in a simple fashion that He ordained this, but for certain reasons understood <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> by the spiritual and clear-sighted. </p>

<p>So far, indeed, as I in my <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, to begin with inferior and more dense things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the denseness of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> and their carnal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and propensity towards matter in everything, made this law: first, in order that <em>the servant and the cattle should rest</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332643"><a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse14">Deuteronomy&nbsp;5:14</a></span> as it is written, for <em>the righteous man regards the life of his beast</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332644"><a href="../bible/pro012.htm#verse10">Proverbs&nbsp;12:10</a></span>: next, in order that when they take their ease from the distraction of material things, they may gather together unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, spending the whole of the seventh day in psalms and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and spiritual songs and the study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> and resting in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For when  the law did not exist and there was no divinely-inspired Scripture, the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But when the divinely-inspired Scripture was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in order that on it they, who do not dedicate their whole life to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who do not make their desire subservient to the Master as though to a Father, but are like foolish servants, may on that day talk much concerning the exercise of it, and may abstract a small, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a most insignificant, portion of their life for the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the chastisements and punishments which threaten transgressors. <em>For the law is not made for a righteous man but for the unrighteous</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332646"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:9</a></span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, was the first to abide <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> with God for forty days and again for another forty , and thus doubtless to afflict himself with hunger on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> although the law forbade self-affliction on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. But if they should object that this took place before the law, what will they say about Elias the Thesbite who accomplished a journey of forty days on one meal <span class="stiki" id="note332648"><a href="../bible/1ki019.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;19:8</a></span>? For he, by thus afflicting himself on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> not only with hunger but with the forty days' journeying, broke the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>: and yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who gave the law, was not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with him but showed Himself to him on Choreb as a reward for his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And what will they say about Daniel? Did he not spend three weeks without food <span class="stiki" id="note332649"><a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse2">Daniel&nbsp;10:2</a></span>? And again, did not all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> circumcise the child on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, if it happened to be the eighth day after birth <span class="stiki" id="note332650"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse12">Genesis&nbsp;17:12</a></span>? And do they not hold the great fast which the law enjoins if it falls on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> <span class="stiki" id="note332651"><a href="../bible/lev016.htm#verse31">Leviticus&nbsp;16:31</a></span>? And further, do not the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> profane the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> in the works of the tabernacle <span class="stiki" id="note332652"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;12:5</a></span> and yet are held blameless? Yea, if an ox should fall into a pit on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, he who draws it forth is blameless, while he who neglects to do so is condemned.  And did not all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> compass the walls of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> bearing the Ark of God for seven days, in which assuredly the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was included <span class="stiki" id="note332654"><a href="../bible/jos003.htm">Joshua&nbsp;iii</a></span> .</p>

<p>As I said , therefore, for the purpose of securing leisure to worship God in order that they might, both servant and beast of burden, devote a very small share to Him and be at rest, the observance of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was devised for the carnal that were still childish and <em>in the bonds of the elements of the world</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332656"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse3">Galatians&nbsp;4:3</a></span>, and unable to conceive of anything beyond the body and the letter. <em>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Only-begotten Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons</em>.  <em> For to as many of us as received Him, He gave power to become sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332658"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;1:12</a></span> <em>. So that we are no longer servants but sons</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332659"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse7">Galatians&nbsp;4:7</a></span>: no longer under the law but under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: no longer do we serve God in part from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but we are bound to dedicate to Him the whole span of our life, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that servant, I mean <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and desire, to cease from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and bid it devote itself to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, always directing our whole desire towards God and arming our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against the enemies of God: and likewise we hinder that beast of burden, that is the body, from the servitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and urge it forwards to assist to the uttermost the divine precepts.</p>

<p>These are the things which the spiritual law of Christ enjoins on us and those who observe that become superior to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>. <em>For when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part shall be done away</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332660"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:10</a></span>: and when the covering of the law, that is, the veil, is rent asunder through the crucifixion of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and the Spirit shines forth with tongues of fire, the letter shall be done away with, bodily things shall come to an end, the law of servitude shall be fulfilled, and the law of liberty be bestowed on us. Yea  we shall celebrate the perfect rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, I mean the day after the resurrection, on which the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, the Author of Life and our Saviour, shall lead us into the heritage promised to those who serve God in the spirit, a heritage into which He entered Himself as our forerunner after He rose from the dead, and whereon, the gates of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> being opened to Him, He took His seat in bodily form at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, where those who keep the spiritual law shall also come.</p>

<p>What belongs to us , therefore, who walk by the spirit and not by the letter, is the complete abandonment of carnal things, the spiritual service and communion with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is the abandonment of carnal pleasure and of whatever is superfluous and unnecessary. For the foreskin is nothing else than the skin which it superfluous to the organ of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. And, indeed, every pleasure which does not arise from God nor is in God is superfluous to pleasure: and of that the foreskin is the type. The <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, moreover, is the cessation from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so that both things happen to be one, and so both together, when observed by those who are spiritual, do not bring about any breach of the law at all.</p>

<p>Further, observe  that the number seven denotes all the present time, as the most wise Solomon says, to give a portion to seven and also to eight. <span class="stiki" id="note332664"><a href="../bible/ecc011.htm#verse2">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;11:2</a></span> And David , the divine singer when he composed the eighth psalm, sang of the future restoration after the resurrection from the dead. Since the Law, therefore, enjoined that the seventh day should be spent in rest from carnal things and devoted to spiritual things, it was a mystic indication to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Israelite who had a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he should through all time offer himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and rise higher than carnal things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Concerning Virginity.</h2>

<p>Carnal men abuse <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> , and the pleasure-loving bring forward the following verse in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, <em>Cursed be every one that raises not up seed in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></em>.  But we, made confident by <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> that was made flesh of the Virgin, answer that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> was implanted in man's nature from above and in the beginning. For man was formed of virgin soil. From <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> alone was Eve created. In Paradise <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> held sway. Indeed, Divine Scripture tells that <em>both <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> were naked and were not ashamed</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332668"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;2:23</a></span> But after their transgression they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they were naked, and in their shame they sewed aprons for themselves.  And when, after the transgression, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> heard, <em>dust you are and unto dust shall you return</em> , when death entered into the world by reason of the transgression, then <em>Adam <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Eve his wife, and she conceived and bare seed</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332671"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;4:1</a></span> So that to prevent the wearing out and destruction of the race by death, marriage was devised that the race of men may be preserved through the procreation of children. </p>

<p>But they will perhaps ask, what then is the meaning of <q>male and female <span class="stiki" id="note332673"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;1:27</a></span>,</q> and <q>Be fruitful and multiply?</q> In answer we shall say that <q>Be fruitful and multiply </q> does not altogether refer to the multiplying by the marriage connection. For God had power to multiply the race also in different ways, if they kept the precept unbroken  to the end.  But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things before they have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> in His foreknowledge that they would fall into transgression in the future and be condemned to death, anticipated this and made <q>male and female,</q> and bade them <q>be fruitful and multiply.</q> Let us, then, proceed on our way and see the glories  of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>: and this also includes <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> when he was commanded to enter the ark and was entrusted with the preservation of the seed of the world received this command, <em>Go in</em>, says the Lord, <em>you and your sons, and your wife, and your sons' wives</em>.  He separated them from their wives  in order that with purity they might escape the flood and that shipwreck of the whole world. After the cessation of the flood, however, He said, <em>Go forth of the ark, you and your sons, and your wife, and your sons' wives</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332680"><a href="../bible/gen008.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;8:16</a></span> Lo, again, marriage is granted for the sake of the multiplication of the race. Next, Elias, the fire-breathing charioteer and sojourner in heaven did not embrace celibacy, and yet was not his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> attested by his super-<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ascension <span class="stiki" id="note332681"><a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;2:11</a></span>? Who closed the heavens? Who raised the dead ? Who divided Jordan ? Was it not the virginal Elias? And did not Elisha, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, after he had given <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of equal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, ask and obtain as an inheritance a double portion of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit ? What of the three youths? Did they not by practising <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> become mightier than fire, their bodies through <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> being made <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> against the fire <span class="stiki" id="note332685"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse20">Daniel&nbsp;3:20</a></span>? And was it not Daniel's body that was so hardened by <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> that the wild beasts' teeth could not fasten in it.  Did not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He wished the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> to see Him, bid them purify the body ? Did not the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> purify themselves and so approach the temple's shrine and offer victims? And did not the law call <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> the great vow?</p>

<p>The precept of the law, therefore, is to be taken in a more spiritual sense. For there is spiritual seed which is conceived through the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the spiritual womb, travailing and bringing forth the spirit of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And in this sense must be understood this verse: <em>Blessed is he who has seed in Zion and posterity in Jerusalem. </em>For does it mean that, although he be a whoremonger and a drunkard and an idolater, he is still blessed if only he has seed in Sion and posterity in Jerusalem? No one in his senses will say this.</p>

<p>Virginity is the rule of life among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the property of all incorporeal nature. This we say without speaking ill of marriage: God forbid! (for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Lord blessed marriage by His presence <span class="stiki" id="note332688"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;2:1</a></span>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him who said, <em>Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and the bed undefiled</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332689"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;13:4</a></span>), but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is better than marriage, however good. For among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, equally as among the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, there are higher and lower grades. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all mortals after the first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of the race are the offspring of marriage. For the first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were the work of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and not of marriage. But celibacy is, as we said, an imitation of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is as much more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> than marriage, as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is higher than man. But why do I say <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>? Christ Himself is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, who was not only-begotten of the Father without beginning or emission or connection, but also became man in our image, being made flesh for our sakes of the Virgin without connection, and manifesting in Himself the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Wherefore, although He did not enjoin that on us by law (for as He said, <em>all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> cannot receive this saying</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332690"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;19:11</a></span>), yet in actual fact He taught us that and gave us strength for it. For it is surely clear to every one that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> now is flourishing among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<p>Good indeed is the procreation of children enjoined by the law, and good is marriage  on account of fornications, for it does away with these <span class="stiki" id="note332692"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:2</a></span>, and by lawful intercourse does not permit the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of desire to be enflamed into unlawful acts. Good is marriage for those who have no continence: but that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is better which increases the fruitfulness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and offers to God the seasonable fruit of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <em>Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and the bed undefiled, but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332693"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;13:4</a></span> .</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. Concerning the Circumcision.</h2>

<p>The Circumcision  was given to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> before the law, after the blessings, after the promise, as a sign separating him and his offspring and his household from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> with whom he lived. <span class="stiki" id="note332695"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;17:10</a></span> And this is evident , for when the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> passed forty years alone by themselves in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, having no intercourse with any other race, all that were born in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> were uncircumcised: but when Joshua  led them across Jordan, they were <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and a second law of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was instituted. For in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> time the law of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was given, and for the forty years in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> it fell into abeyance. And again for the second time God gave the law of Circumcision to Joshua, after the crossing of Jordan, according as it is written in the book of Joshua, the son of Nun: <em>At that time the Lord said unto Joshua, Make you knives of stone from the sharp rock, and assemble and circumcise the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> a second time</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332698"><a href="../bible/jos005.htm#verse2">Joshua&nbsp;5:2</a></span>; and a little later: <em>For the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> walked forty and two</em>  <em>years in the wilderness of Battaris</em>  <em>, till all the people that were men of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, which came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, were uncircumcised, because they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> not the voice of the Lord: unto whom the Lord swore that He would not show them the good land, which the Lord swore unto their fathers that He would give them, a land that flows with milk and honey. And their children, whom He raised up in their stead, them Joshua <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> them by the way</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332701"><a href="../bible/jos005.htm#verse6">Joshua&nbsp;5:6-7</a></span> So that the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was a sign, dividing <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> with whom they dwelt.</p>

<p>It was, moreover, a figure of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.  For just as the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> does not cut off a useful member of the body but only a useless superfluity, so by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> we are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> clearly is, so to speak, the superfluous part of desire and not useful desire. For it is quite impossible that any one should have no desire at all nor ever experience the taste of pleasure. But the useless part of pleasure, that is to say, useless desire and pleasure, it is this that is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from which <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> circumcises us, giving us as a token the precious cross on the brow, not to divide us from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> (for all the nations received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and were sealed with the sign of the Cross), but to distinguish in each nation the faithful from the faithless. Wherefore, when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is revealed, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is a senseless figure and shade. So <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is now superfluous and contrary to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. <em>For he who is <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> is a debtor to do the whole law</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332703"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse3">Galatians&nbsp;5:3</a></span> Further, the Lord was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> that He might fulfil the law: and He fulfilled the whole law and observed the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> that He might fulfil and establish the law. <span class="stiki" id="note332704"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span> Moreover after He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had appeared to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, descending on Him in the form of a dove, from that time the spiritual service and conduct of life and the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> was preached.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Concerning the Antichrist. </h2>

<p>It should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> is bound to come. Every one, therefore, who confesses not that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> came in the flesh and is perfect God and became perfect man, after being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note332706"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:22</a></span> But in a peculiar and special sense he who comes at the consummation of the age is called <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>.  First, then, it is requisite that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> should be preached among all nations, as the Lord said <span class="stiki" id="note332708"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;24:14</a></span>, and then he will come to refute the impious <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For the Lord said to them: <em>I have come in My Father's name and you receive Me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332709"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;5:43</a></span> And the apostle says, <em>Because they received not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that they might be saved, for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> God shall send them a strong delusion that they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>: that they all might be damned who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but had pleasure in unrighteousness</em>.  The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> accordingly did not receive the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> who was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but receive the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> who calls himself God.  For that he will assume the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> teaches Daniel, saying these words, <em>Neither shall he regard the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of his fathers</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332712"><a href="../bible/dan011.htm#verse37">Daniel&nbsp;11:37</a></span> And the apostle says: <em>Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first, and that man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be revealed, the son of perdition: who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped, so that he sits in the temple of God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332713"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:3-4</a></span> <em>, showing himself that he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; </em>in the temple of God he said; not our temple, but the old Jewish temple.  For he will come not to us but to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: not for Christ or the things of Christ: wherefore he is called <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. </p>

<p>First, therefore, it is necessary that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> should be preached among all nations <span class="stiki" id="note332716"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;25:14</a></span>: <em>And then shall that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one be </em> <em>revealed, even him whose coming is after the working of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> with all power and signs and lying wonders</em>  <em>, with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, whom the Lord shall consume with the word of His mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming</em>.  The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself , therefore does not become man in the way that the Lord was made man. God forbid! But he becomes man as the offspring of fornication and receives all the energy of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, foreknowing the strangeness of the choice that he would make, allows the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to take up his abode in him. </p>

<p>He is, therefore, as we said, the offspring of fornication and is nurtured in secret, and on a sudden he rises up and rebels and assumes rule. And in the beginning of his rule, or rather tyranny, he assumes the role of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>.  But when he becomes master he persecutes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> and displays all his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. But he will come <em>with signs and lying wonders</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332722"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:9</a></span>, fictitious and not real, and he will deceive and lead away from the living God those whose mind rests on an unsound and unstable foundation, so that even the elect shall, if it be possible, be made to stumble <span class="stiki" id="note332723"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;24:24</a></span> .</p>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> and Elias the Thesbite shall be sent and shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , that is, the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> and the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: and they will be destroyed by him. And the Lord shall come out of heaven, just as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> beheld Him going into heaven, perfect God and perfect man, with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power, and will destroy the man of lawlessness, the son of destruction, with the breath of His mouth. <span class="stiki" id="note332725"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;1:11</a></span> Let no one, therefore, look for the Lord to come from earth, but out of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, as He himself has made sure <span class="stiki" id="note332726"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> .</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. Concerning the Resurrection.</h2>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in the resurrection of the dead. For there will be in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, there will be, a resurrection of the dead, and by resurrection we mean resurrection of bodies. <span class="stiki" id="note332727"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse35">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:35-44</a></span> For resurrection is the second state of that which has fallen. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and hence how can they rise again? For if they define death as the separation of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, resurrection surely is the re-union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and the second state of the living creature that has suffered dissolution and downfall.  It is, then, this very body, which is corruptible and liable to dissolution, that will rise again incorruptible. For He, who made it in the beginning of the sand of the earth, does not lack the power to raise it up again after it has been dissolved again and returned to the earth from which it was taken, in accordance with the reversal of the Creator's judgment.</p>

<p>For if there is no resurrection, let us eat and drink : let us pursue a life of pleasure and enjoyment. If there is no resurrection, wherein do we differ from the irrational brutes? If there is no resurrection, let us hold the wild beasts of the field <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who have a life free from sorrow. If there is no resurrection, neither is there any God nor Providence, but all things are driven and borne along of themselves. For observe how we see most righteous men suffering hunger and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and receiving no help in the present life, while sinners and unrighteous men abound in riches and every delight. And who in his senses would take this for the work of a righteous judgment or a wise <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>? There must be, therefore, there must be, a resurrection. For God is just and is the rewarder of those who submit patiently to Him. Wherefore if it is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone that engages in the contests of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it is also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone that will receive the crown. And if it were the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone that revels in pleasures, it would also be the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone that would be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> punished. But since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not pursue either <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> separate from the body, both together will obtain that which is their just due.</p>

<p>Nay, the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that there will be a resurrection of the body. God in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> after the flood, <em>Even as the green herb have I given you all things. But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall you not eat. And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. Whoso sheds man's blood, for his blood his own shall be shed, for in the image of God made I man</em>.  How will He require the blood of man at the hand of every beast, unless because the bodies of dead men will rise again? For not for man will the beasts die.</p>

<p>And again to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <em>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Abra</em> <em>ham, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob: God is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the dead</em> (that is, those who are dead and will be no more), <em>but of the living</em> , whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> indeed live in His hand <span class="stiki" id="note332732"><a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse1">Wisdom&nbsp;3:1</a></span>, but whose bodies will again come to life through the resurrection. And David, sire of the Divine, says to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust</em>.  See how he speaks about bodies. Then he subjoins this, <em>You send forth Your Spirit, they are created: and You renew the face of the earth</em>. </p>

<p>Further Isaiah says: <em>The dead shall rise again, and they that are in the graves shall awake</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332735"><a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;26:18</a></span> And it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> do not lie in the graves, but the bodies.</p>

<p>And again, the blessed Ezekiel says: <em>And it was as I prophesied, and behold a shaking and the bones came together, bone to his bone, each to its own joint: and when I beheld, lo, the sinews came up upon them and the flesh grew and rose up on them and the skin covered them above</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332736"><a href="../bible/eze037.htm#verse7">Ezekiel&nbsp;37:7</a></span> And later he teaches how the spirits came back when they were bidden.</p>

<p>And divine Daniel also says: <em>And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which stands for the children of your people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such trouble as never was since there was a nation on the earth even to that same time. And at that time your people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake: some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and out of the multitude of the just shall shine like stars into the ages and beyond</em>.  The words, <em>many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake</em>, clearly show that there will be a resurrection of bodies. For no one surely would say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> sleep in the dust of the earth.</p>

<p>Moreover, even the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> clearly allows that there is a resurrection of the bodies. <em>For they that are in the graves, He says, shall hear His voice and shall come forth: they that have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> unto the resurrection of damnation</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332738"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;5:28-29</a></span> Now no one in his senses would ever say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are in the graves.</p>

<p>But it was not only by word, but also by deed, that the Lord revealed the resurrection of the bodies. First He raised up Lazarus, even after he had been dead four days, and was stinking. <span class="stiki" id="note332739"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;11:39-44</a></span> For He did not raise the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without the body, but the body along with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and not another body but the very one that was corrupt. For how could the resurrection of the dead man have been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> if it had not been established by his characteristic properties? But it was in fact to make the divinity of His own nature manifest and to confirm the belief in His own and our resurrection, that He raised up Lazarus who was destined once more to die. And the Lord became Himself the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the perfect resurrection that is no longer subject to death. Wherefore also the divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> said: <em>If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised. And if Christ be not raised, our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is vain: we are yet in our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332740"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:16-17</a></span> And, <em>Now is Christ risen from the dead and become the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of them that slept</em> , <em>and the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> from the dead</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332742"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse18">Colossians&nbsp;1:18</a></span>; and again, <em>For if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332743"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:14</a></span> <em>Even so</em>, he said, <em>as Christ rose again. </em>Moreover, that the resurrection of the Lord was the union of uncorrupted body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (for it was these that had been divided) is manifest: for He said, <em>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332744"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is a trustworthy <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that He spoke of His own body. <em>Handle Me and see</em>, the Lord said to His own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when they were thinking that they saw a spirit, <em>that it is I Myself, and that I am not changed</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332745"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse37">Luke&nbsp;24:37</a></span> <em>: for a spirit has not flesh or bones, as you see Me have</em>.  And when He had said this He showed them His hands and His side, and stretched them forward for Thomas to touch. <span class="stiki" id="note332747"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;20:27</a></span> Is not this sufficient to establish belief in the resurrection of bodies?</p>

<p>Again the divine apostle says, <em>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note332748"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse35">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:35</a></span> And again: <em>It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power: it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: it is sown a natural body </em>(that is to say, crass and mortal), <em>it is raised a spiritual body</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332749"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse42">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:42,&nbsp;44</a></span>, such as was our Lord's body after the resurrection which passed through closed doors, was unwearying, had no need of food, or sleep, or drink. <em>For they will be</em>, says the Lord, <em>as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332750"><a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse25">Mark&nbsp;12:25</a></span>: there will no longer be marriage nor procreation of children. The divine apostle, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, says, <em>For our conversation is in heaven, from whence </em> <em>also we look for the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, Who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> body</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332751"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;3:20-21</a></span>: not meaning change into another form (God forbid!), but rather the change from corruption into incorruption. </p>

<p>But some one will say, <em>How are the dead raised up? </em>Oh, what disbelief! Oh, what folly! Will He, Who at His solitary will changed earth into body, Who commanded the little drop of seed to grow in the mother's womb and become in the end this varied and manifold organ of the body, not the rather raise up again at His solitary will that which was and is dissolved? <em>And with what body do they come</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332753"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse35">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:35</a></span> <em>? Thou fool</em>, if your hardness will not permit you to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at least <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> His works.  <em>For that which you sow is not quickened except it die</em> <span class="stiki" id="note332755"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse35">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:35</a></span> <em>. And that which you sow, you sow not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat or of some other grain. But God gives it a body as it has pleased Him, and to every seed his own body</em>.  Behold, therefore, how the seed is buried in the furrows as in tombs. Who is it that gives them roots and stalk and leaves and ears and the most delicate beards? Is it not the Maker of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>? Is it not at the bidding of Him Who has contrived all things? Believe, therefore, in this wise, even that the resurrection of the dead will come to pass at the divine will and sign. For He has power that is able to keep pace with His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.</p>

<p>We shall therefore rise again, our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> being once more united with our bodies, now made incorruptible and having put off corruption, and we shall stand beside the awful judgment-seat of Christ: and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and the man that is his, that is the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> and the impious and the sinful, will be given over to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>: not material fire  like our fire, but such fire as God would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But those who have done good will shine forth as the sun with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> into life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, ever seeing Him and being in His sight and deriving unceasing <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> from Him, praising Him with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> throughout the limitless ages of ages.  <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
