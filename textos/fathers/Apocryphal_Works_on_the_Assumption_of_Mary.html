<h1>Apocryphal Works on the Assumption of Mary</h1>

<h2>The Account of St. John the Theologian  of the Falling Asleep of the Holy Mother of God.</h2>

<p>As the all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and ever-virgin Mary, as was her wont, was going to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> tomb of our Lord to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and bending her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> knees, she was importunate that Christ our God who had been born of her should return to her. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, seeing her lingering by the divine sepulchre, came to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, saying: Mary goes every day to the tomb. And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, having summoned the guards set by them not to allow any one to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sepulchre, inquired about her, whether in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it were so. And the guards answered and said that they had seen no such thing, God having not allowed them to see her when there. And on one of the days, it being the preparation, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Mary, as was her wont, came to the sepulchre; and while she was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, it came to pass that the heavens were opened, and the archangel Gabriel came down to her and said: Hail, you that brought forth Christ our God! Your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> having come through to the heavens to Him who was born of you, has been accepted; and from this time, according to your request, you having left the world, shall go to the heavenly places to your Son, into the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and everlasting life.</p>

<p>And having heard this from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> archangel, she returned to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, having along with her three <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who ministered unto her. And after having rested a short time, she sat up and said to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>: Bring me a censer, that I may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. And they brought it, as they had been commanded. And she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, saying: My Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who deigned through Your supreme goodness to be born of me, hear my voice, and send me Your apostle John, in order that, seeing him, I may partake of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; and send me also the rest of Your <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, both those who have already gone to You, and those in the world that now is, in whatever country they may be, through Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> commandment, in order that, having beheld them, I may bless Your name much to be praised; for I am confident that You hear Your servant in everything.</p>

<p>And while she was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, I John came, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> having snatched me up by a cloud from Ephesus, and set me in the place where the mother of my Lord was lying. And having gone in beside her, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him who had been born of her, I said: Hail, mother of my Lord, who brought forth Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that in great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> you are going out of this life. And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother of God <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because I John had come to her, remembering the voice of the Lord, saying: Behold your mother, and, Behold your son. <span class="stiki" id="note082616"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;19:26-27</a></span> And the three <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> came and worshipped. And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother of God says to me: Pray, and cast <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. And I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> thus: Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who has done wonderful things, now also do wonderful things before her who brought You forth; and let Your mother depart from this life; and let those who crucified You, and who have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in You, be confounded. And after I had ended the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Mary said to me: Bring me the censer. And having cast <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, she said, Glory to You, my God and my Lord, because there has been fulfilled in me whatsoever You promised to me before you ascended into the heavens, that when I should depart from this world You would come to me, and the multitude of Your <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And I John say to her: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord and our God is coming, and you see  Him, as He promised to you. And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother of God answered and said to me: The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> that after I have died they will burn my body. And I answered and said to her: Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and precious body will by no means see corruption. And she answered and said to me: Bring a censer, and cast <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. And there came a voice out of the heavens saying the <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. And I John heard this voice; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> said to me: John, have you heard this voice that spoke in the heaven after the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was ended? And I answered and said: Yes, I heard. And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> said to me: This voice which you heard denotes that the appearance of your brethren the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> is at hand, and of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> powers that they are coming hither today.</p>

<p>And at this I John <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: Let all of you together, having come by the clouds from the ends of the world, be assembled to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> by a whirlwind, on account of the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; Peter from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> from Tiberia,  Thomas from Hither India, James from Jerusalem. Andrew, Peter's brother, and Philip, Luke, and Simon the Canan&aelig;an, and Thadd&aelig;us who had fallen asleep, were raised by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> out of their tombs; to whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> said: Do not think that it is now the resurrection; but on this account you have risen out of your tombs, that you may go to give greeting to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and wonder-working of the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a>, because the day of her departure is at hand, of her going up into the heavens. And Mark likewise coming round, was present from <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>; he also with the rest, as has been said before, from each country. And Peter being lifted up by a cloud, stood between heaven and earth, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> keeping him steady. And at the same time, the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> also, having been snatched up in clouds, were found along with Peter. And thus by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as has been said, they all came together.</p>

<p>And having gone in beside the mother of our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and having adored, we said: Fear not, nor grieve; God the Lord, who was born of you, will take you out of this world with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And rejoicing in God her Saviour, she sat up in the bed, and says to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: Now have I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that our Master and God is coming from heaven, and I shall behold Him, and thus depart from this life, as I have seen that you have come. And I wish you to tell me how you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that I was departing and came to me, and from what countries and through what distance you have come hither, that you have thus made haste to visit me. For neither has He who was born of me, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, concealed it; for I am persuaded even now that He is the Son of the Most High.</p>

<p>And Peter answered and said to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: Let us each, according to what the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> announced and commanded us, give full information to the mother of our Lord. And I John answered and said: Just as I was going in to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> to perform divine service, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> says to me, The time of the departure of the mother of your Lord is at hand; go to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> to salute her. And a cloud of light snatched me up, and set me down in the door where you are lying. Peter also answered: And I, living in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, about dawn heard a voice through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> saying to me, The mother of your Lord is to depart, as the time is at hand; go to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> to salute her. And, behold, a cloud of light snatched me up; and I beheld also the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> coming to me on clouds, and a voice saying to me, Go all to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also answered and said: And I, living in a city at no great distance from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, called the country of Tiberia, heard the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> saying to me, The mother of your Lord, having left this world, is making her course to the celestial regions through her departure;  but go also to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> to salute her. And, behold, a cloud of light having snatched me up, set me down in the same place as you. And Thomas also answered and said: And I, traversing the country of the Indians, when the preaching was prevailing by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the king's sister's son Labdanus by name, was about to be sealed by me in the palace, on a sudden the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> says to me, Go also, Thomas, to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> to salute the mother of your Lord, because she is taking her departure to the heavens. And a cloud of light having snatched me up, set me down beside you. And Mark also answered and said: And when I was finishing the canon  of the third <em>day</em> in the city of Alexandria, just as I was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> snatched me up, and brought me to you. And James also answered and said: While I was in Jerusalem, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> commanded me, saying, Go to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, because the mother of your Lord is taking her departure. And, behold, a cloud of light having snatched me up, set me beside you. And Matthew also answered and said: I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> and do glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because when I was in a boat and overtaken by a storm, the sea raging with its waves, on a sudden a cloud of light overshadowing the stormy billow, changed it to a calm, and having snatched me up, set me down beside you. And those who had come before likewise answered, and gave an account of how they had come. And Bartholomew said: I was in the Thebais proclaiming the word, and behold the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> says to me, The mother of your Lord is taking her departure; go, then, to salute her in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. And, behold, a cloud of light having snatched me up, brought me to you.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> said all these things to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why they had come, and in what way; and she stretched her hands to heaven and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, saying: I adore, and praise, and glorify Your much to be praised name, O Lord, because You have looked upon the lowliness of Your handmaiden, and because You that are mighty has done great things for me; and, behold, all generations shall count me blessed. <span class="stiki" id="note082621"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;1:48</a></span> And after the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> she said to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: Cast <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. And when they had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, there was thunder from heaven, and there came a fearful voice, as if of chariots; and, behold, a multitude of a host of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and powers, and a voice, as if of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, was heard, and the seraphim in a circle round the house where the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, spotless mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and virgin was lying, so that all who were in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> beheld all the wonderful things, and came to Jerusalem and reported all the wonderful things that had come to pass. And it came to pass, when the voice was heard, that the sun and the moon suddenly appeared about the house; and an assembly  of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> stood beside the house where the mother of the Lord was lying, for her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And I beheld also that many signs came to pass, the blind seeing, the deaf hearing, the lame walking, <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> cleansed, and those possessed by unclean spirits cured; and every one who was under disease and sickness, touching the outside of the wall of the house where she was lying, cried out: Holy Mary, who brought forth Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have mercy upon us. And they were straightway cured. And great multitudes out of every country living in Jerusalem for the sake of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, having heard of the signs that had come to pass in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> through the mother of the Lord, came to the place seeking the cure of various diseases, which also they obtained. And there was <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> unspeakable on that day among the multitude of those who had been cured, as well as of those who looked on, glorifying Christ our God and His mother. And all Jerusalem from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> kept festival with psalms and spiritual songs.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, along with their people, were astonished at the things which had come to pass; and being moved  with the heaviest <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and again with frivolous reasoning, having made an assembly, they determine to send against the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> who were there in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. And accordingly the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, having directed their course to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, when at the distance of one mile it came to pass that they beheld a frightful vision, and their feet were held fast; and after this they returned to their fellow-countrymen, and reported all the frightful vision to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. And they, still more boiling with rage, go to the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, crying out and saying: The nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> has been ruined by this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; chase her from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> and the province of Jerusalem. And the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, astonished at the wonderful things, said to them: I will chase her neither from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> nor from any other place. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> continued crying out, and adjuring him by the health of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a> to bring the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> out of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. And if you do not do so, we shall report it to the C&aelig;sar. Accordingly, being compelled, he sends a tribune of the soldiers  against the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> says to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and the mother of the Lord: Behold, the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> has sent a tribune against you, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> having made an uproar. Go forth therefore from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not: for, behold, by a cloud I shall bring you to Jerusalem; for the power of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is with you. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> therefore rose up immediately, and went forth from the house, carrying the bed of the Lady the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and directed their course to Jerusalem; and immediately, as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had said, being lifted up by a cloud, they were found in Jerusalem in the house of the Lady. And they stood up, and for five days made an unceasing singing of praise. And when the tribune came to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and found there neither the mother of the Lord nor the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, he laid hold of the Bethlehemites, saying to them: Did you not come telling the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> all the signs and wonders that had come to pass, and how the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had come out of every country? Where are they, then? Come, go to the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> at Jerusalem. For the tribune did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of the departure of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and the Lord's mother to Jerusalem. The tribune then, having taken the Bethlehemites, went in to the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, saying that he had found no one. And after five days it was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and all the city, that the Lord's mother was in her own house in Jerusalem, along with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, from the signs and wonders that came to pass there. And a multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> came together, and cried out: Holy virgin, that brought forth Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do not forget the generation of men. And when these things came to pass, the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> also, being the more moved with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, took wood and fire, and came up, wishing to burn the house where the Lord's mother was living with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> stood looking at the sight from afar off. And when the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> came to the door of the house, behold, suddenly a power of fire coming forth from within, by means of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, burnt up a great multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And there was great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> throughout all the city; and they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who had been born of her. And when the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> saw what had come to pass, he cried out to all the people, saying: Truly he who was born of the virgin, whom you have thought of driving away, is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; for these signs are those of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. And there was a division among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, in consequence of the signs that had come to pass.</p>

<p>And after all these wonderful things had come to pass through the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and ever-virgin Mary the mother of the Lord, while we the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were with her in Jerusalem, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> said to us: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that on the Lord's day the good news was brought to the Virgin Mary by the archangel Gabriel; and on the Lord's day the Saviour was born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>; and on the Lord's day the children of Jerusalem came forth with palm branches to meet him, saying, <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> in the highest, blessed is  He that comes in the name of the Lord;  and on the Lord's day He rose from the dead; and on the Lord's day He will come to judge the living and the dead; and on the Lord's day He will come out of heaven, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the departure of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> virgin who brought Him forth. And on the same  Lord's day the mother of the Lord says to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: Cast <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, because Christ is coming with a host of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and, behold, Christ is at hand, sitting on a throne of <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>. And while we were all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, there appeared innumerable multitudes of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and the Lord mounted upon <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> in great power; and, behold, a stream of light  coming to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> virgin, because of the presence of her only-begotten Son, and all the powers of the heavens fell down and adored Him. And the Lord, speaking to His mother, said: Mary. And she answered and said: Here am I, Lord. And the Lord said to her: Grieve not, but let your heart <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and be glad; for you have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to behold the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> given to me by my Father. And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother of God looked up, and saw in Him a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which it is impossible for the mouth of man to speak of, or to apprehend. And the Lord remained beside her, saying: Behold, from the present time your precious body will be transferred to paradise, and your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the heavens to the treasures of my Father in exceeding brightness, where there is peace and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash;and other things besides.  And the mother of the Lord answered and said to him: Lay Your right hand upon me, O Lord, and bless me. And the Lord stretched forth His undefiled right hand, and blessed her. And she laid hold of His undefiled right hand, and kissed it, saying: I adore this right hand, which created the heaven and the earth; and I call upon Your much to be praised name Christ, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the King of the ages, the only-begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, to receive Your handmaid, Thou who deigned to be brought forth by me, in a low estate, to save the race of men through Your ineffable dispensation; do Thou bestow Your aid upon every man calling upon, or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to, or naming the name of, Your handmaid. And while she is saying this, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, having gone up to her feet and adored, say: O mother of the Lord, leave a blessing to the world, since you are going away from it. For you have blessed it, and raised it up when it was ruined, by bringing forth the Light of the world. And the mother of the Lord <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and in her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> spoke thus: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who through Your great goodness hast sent from the heavens Your only-begotten Son to dwell in my <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> body, who hast deigned to be born of me, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <em>as I am</em>, have mercy upon the world, and every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that calls upon Your name. And again she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and said: O Lord, King of the heavens, Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, accept every man who calls upon Your name, that Your birth may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. And again she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and said: O Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who art all-powerful in heaven and on earth, in this appeal I implore Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name; in every time and place where there is made mention of my name, make that place <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and glorify those that glorify You through my name, accepting of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> all their offering, and all their supplication, and all their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. And when she had thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, the Lord said to His mother: Let your heart <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and be glad; for every favour  and every gift has been given to you from my Father in heaven, and from me, and from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>: every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that calls upon your name shall not be ashamed, but shall find mercy, and comfort, and support, and confidence, both in the world that now is, and in that which is to come, in the presence of my Father in the heavens. And the Lord turned and said to Peter: The time has come to begin the singing of the hymn. And Peter having begun the singing of the hymn, all the powers of the heavens responded with the Alleluiah. And then the face of the mother of the Lord shone brighter than the light, and she rose up and blessed each of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> with her own hand, and all gave <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the Lord stretched forth His undefiled hands, and received her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blameless <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And with the departure of her blameless <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the place was filled with perfume and ineffable light; and, behold, a voice out of the heaven was heard, saying: Blessed are you among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And Peter, and I John, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and Thomas, ran and wrapped up her precious feet for the consecration; and the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> put her precious and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body upon a couch, and carried it. And, behold, while they were carrying her, a certain well-born Hebrew, Jephonias by name, running against the body, put his hands upon the couch; and, behold, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord by invisible power, with a sword of fire, cut off his two hands from his shoulders, and made them hang about the couch, lifted up in the air. And at this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> which had come to pass all the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who beheld it cried out: Verily, He that was brought forth by you is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, O mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ever-virgin Mary. And Jephonias himself, when Peter ordered him, that the wonderful things of God might be showed forth, stood up behind the couch, and cried out: Holy Mary, who brought forth Christ who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have mercy upon me. And Peter turned and said to him: In the name of Him who was born of her, your hands which have been taken away from you, will be fixed on again. And immediately, at the word of Peter, the hands hanging by the couch of the Lady came, and were fixed on Jephonias. And he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Christ, God who had been born of her.</p>

<p>And when this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> had been done, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> carried  the couch, and laid down her precious and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body in Gethsemane in a new tomb. And, behold, a perfume of sweet savour came forth out of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sepulchre of our Lady the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and for three days the voices of invisible <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were heard glorifying Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who had been born of her. And when the third day was ended, the voices were no longer heard; and from that time forth all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that her spotless and precious body had been transferred to paradise.</p>

<p>And after it had been transferred, behold, we see <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a> the mother of St. John the Baptist, and Anna the mother of the Lady, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, and David, singing the Alleluiah, and all the choirs of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> adoring the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> relics of the mother of the Lord, and the place full of light, than which light nothing could be more brilliant, and an abundance of perfume in that place to which her precious and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body had been transferred in paradise, and the melody of those praising Him who had been born of her&mdash; sweet melody, of which there is no satiety, such as is given to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and them only, to hear. We <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, therefore, having beheld the sudden precious translation of her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who had shown us His wonders at the departure of the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, whose  <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and good offices may we all be deemed worthy to receive,  under her shelter, and support, and protection, both in the world that now is and in that which is to come, glorifying in every time and place her only-begotten Son, along with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>The Passing of Mary</h2>

<h3>First Latin Form</h3>

<p> <em>Concerning the Passing  of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</em></p>

<p>In that time before the Lord came to His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, and among many words which the mother asked of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, she began to ask Him about her own departure, addressing Him as follows:&mdash; O most dear Son, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, that when my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> goes out of my body, Thou let me <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> on the third day before; and do Thou, beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, with Your <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, receive it.  Then He received the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of His beloved mother, and said to her: O palace and temple of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, O blessed mother,  O queen of all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and blessed above all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, before you carried me in your womb, I always guarded you, and caused you to be fed daily with my angelic food,  as you know, how can I desert you, after you have carried me, and nourished me, and brought me down in flight into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and endured many hardships for me? Know, then, that my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have always guarded you, and will guard you even until your departure. But after I undergo suffering for men, as it is written, and rise again on the third day, and after forty days ascend into heaven, when you shall see me coming to you  with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and archangels, with <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and with <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and with my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain that your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be separated from the body, and I shall carry it into heaven, where it shall never at all have tribulation or anguish. Then she joyed and gloried, and kissed the knees of her Son, and blessed the Creator of heaven and earth, who gave her such a gift through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> her Son.</p>

<p>In the second year, therefore, after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the most blessed Virgin Mary continued always in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> day and night. And on the third day before she passed away, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord came to her, and saluted her, saying: Hail, Mary, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>! The Lord be with you. And she answered, saying: Thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Again he said to her: Receive this palm which the Lord promised to you. And she, giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> received from the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> the palm sent to her. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord said to her: Your assumption will be after three days. And she answered: Thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p>Then she called Joseph of the city of Arimath&aelig;a, and the other  <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord; and when they, both relations and acquaintances, were assembled, she announced her departure to all standing there. Then the blessed Mary washed  herself, and dressed herself like a queen, and waited the advent of her Son, as He had promised to her. And she asked all her relations to keep beside  her, and give her comfort. And she had along with her three <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, Sepphora, Abigea, and Za&euml;l; but the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> had been already dispersed throughout the whole world to preach to the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Then at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>  there were great thunders, and rains, and lightnings, and tribulation, and an earthquake,  while queen Mary was standing in her chamber. John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> and apostle was suddenly brought from Ephesus, and entered the chamber of the blessed Mary, and saluted her, and said to her: Hail, Mary, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>! The Lord be with you. And she answered: Thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And raising herself up, she kissed Saint John. And the blessed Mary said to him: O my dearest son, why have  you left me at such a time, and hast not paid heed to the commands of your Master, to take care of me, as He commanded you while He was hanging on the cross? And he asked pardon with bended knee. Then the blessed Mary gave him her benediction, and again kissed him. And when she meant to ask him whence he came, and for what reason he had come to Jerusalem, behold, all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord, except Thomas who is called Didymus, were brought by a cloud to the door of the chamber of the blessed Mary. They stood and went in, and saluted the queen with the following words, and adored her: Hail, Mary, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>! The Lord be with you. And she eagerly rose quickly, and bowed herself, and kissed them, and gave thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These are the names of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord who were brought there in the cloud: John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> and James his brother, Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Andrew, Philip, Luke, Barnabas, Bartholomew and Matthew, Matthias who is called Justus,  Simon the Chanan&aelig;an, Judas and his brother, <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> and Maximianus, and many others who cannot be numbered. Then the blessed Mary said to her brethren: What is this, that you have all come to Jerusalem? Peter, answering, said to her: We had need to ask this of you, and do you question us? Certainly, as I think, none of us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> why we have come here today with such rapidity. I was at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and now I am here. All declared plainly the place where they had been that day. And they all wondered that they were there when they heard these things. The blessed Mary said to them: I asked my Son, before He endured the passion, that He and you should be at my death; and He granted me this gift. Whence you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my departure will be tomorrow.  Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with me, that when the Lord comes to receive my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, He may find you watching. Then all promised that they would watch. And they watched and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> the whole night, with psalms and chants, with great illuminations.</p>

<p>And when the Lord's day came, at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> descended upon the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in a cloud,  so Christ descended with a multitude of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and received the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of His beloved mother. For there was such splendour and perfume of sweetness, and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> singing the songs of songs, where the Lord says, As a lily among thorns, so is my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> among the daughters, <span class="stiki" id="note082648"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse2">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:2</a></span> that all who were there present fell on their faces, as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> fell when Christ transfigured Himself before them on <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Mount Thabor</a>, and for a whole hour and a half no one was able to rise. But when the light went away, and at the same time with the light itself, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the blessed virgin Mary was taken up into heaven with psalms, and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and songs of songs. And as the cloud went up the whole earth shook, and in one moment all the inhabitants of Jerusalem openly saw the departure of St. Mary.</p>

<p>And that same hour <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> entered into them, and they began to consider what they were to do with her body. And they took up weapons, that they might burn her body and kill the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, because from her had gone forth the dispersions of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, on account of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the gathering together of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. But they were struck with blindness, striking their heads against the walls, and striking each other.  Then the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, alarmed by so much brightness, arose, and with psalms carried the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body down from Mount Zion to the <a href="../cathen/08503a.htm">valley of Jehoshaphat</a>. But as they were going in the middle of the road, behold, a certain Jew,  Reuben by name, wishing to throw to the ground the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> bier with the body of the blessed Mary. But his hands dried up, even to the elbow; whether he would or not, he went down even to the <a href="../cathen/08503a.htm">Valley of Jehoshaphat</a>, weeping and lamenting because his hands were raised to the bier, and he was not able to draw back his hands to himself. And he began to ask the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>  that by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> he might be saved and made a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Then the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, bending their knees, asked the Lord to let him loose. And he, being healed that same hour, giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and kissing the feet of the queen of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in that same place, and began to preach the name of our God <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>Then the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> laid the body in the tomb, weeping and singing through exceeding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and sweetness. And suddenly there shone round them a light from heaven, and they fell to the ground, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body was taken up by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> into heaven.</p>

<p>Then the most blessed Thomas was suddenly brought to the Mount of Olivet, and saw the most blessed body going up to heaven, and began to cry out and say: O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother, blessed mother, spotless mother, if I have now found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> because I see you, make your servant joyful through your compassion, because you are going to heaven. Then the girdle with which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had encircled the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body was thrown down from heaven to the blessed Thomas. And taking it, and kissing it, and giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he came again into the <a href="../cathen/08503a.htm">Valley of Jehoshaphat</a>. He found all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and another great crowd there beating their breasts on account of the brightness which they had seen. And seeing and kissing each other, the blessed Peter said to him: Truly you have always been obdurate and unbelieving, because for your unbelief it was not pleasing to God that you should be along with us at the burial of the mother of the Saviour. And he, beating his breast, said: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and firmly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I have always been a bad and an unbelieving man; therefore I ask pardon of all of you for my obduracy and unbelief. And they all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for him. Then the blessed Thomas said: Where have you laid her body? And they pointed out the sepulchre with their finger. And he said: The body which is called most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> is not there. Then the blessed Peter said to him: Already on another occasion you would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the resurrection of our Master and Lord at our word, unless you went to touch Him with your fingers, and see Him; how will you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> us that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body is here? Still he persists saying: It is not here. Then, as it were in a rage, they went to the sepulchre, which was a new one hollowed out in the rock, and took up the stone; but they did not find the body, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what to say, because they had been convicted by the words of Thomas. Then the blessed Thomas told them how he was singing mass in India&mdash; he still had on his sacerdotal robes. He, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had been brought to the Mount of Olivet, and saw the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body of the blessed Mary going up into heaven, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> her to give him a blessing. She heard his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and threw him her girdle which she had about her. And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> seeing the belt which they had put about her, glorifying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all asked pardon of the blessed Thomas, on account of the benediction which the blessed Mary had given him, and because he had seen the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body going up into heaven. And the blessed Thomas gave them his benediction, and said: Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! </p>

<p>And the same cloud by which they had been brought carried them back each to his own place, just like Philip when he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the eunuch, as is read in the Acts of the Apostles; <span class="stiki" id="note082653"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse39">Acts&nbsp;8:39</a></span> and as Habakkuk the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> carried food to Daniel, who was in the lions' den, and quickly returned to Jud&aelig;a.  And so also the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> quickly returned to where they had at first been, to preach to the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor is it to be wondered at that He should do such things, who went into the virgin and came out of her though her womb was closed; who, though the gates were shut, went in to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note082655"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;20:19</a></span> who made the deaf to hear, raised the dead, cleansed the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, gave sight to the blind,  and did many other wonderful things. To <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this is no doubtful matter.</p>

<p>I am Joseph who laid the Lord's body in my sepulchre, and saw Him rising again; and who, before the ascension and after the ascension of the Lord, always kept his most sacred temple the blessed ever-virgin Mary, and <em>who have kept</em> in writing and in my breast the things which came forth from the mouth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and how the things mentioned above were done by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And I have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, those things which I saw with my eyes, and heard with my ears; and as long as I live I shall not cease to declare them. And her, whose assumption is at this day venerated and worshipped throughout the whole world, let us assiduously entreat that she be mindful of us in the presence of her most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Son in heaven, to whom is praise and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> through endless ages of ages. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>

<h3>Second Latin Form</h3>

<p> <em>Here Begins the Passing of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</em></p>

<p>1.  <span class="sc">Therefore</span>, when the Lord and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was hanging on the tree fastened by the nails of the cross for the life of the whole world, He saw about the cross His mother standing, and John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, whom He peculiarly loved above the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, because he alone of them was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in the body. He gave him, therefore, the charge of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Mary, saying to him: Behold your mother! And saying, to her: Behold your son! <span class="stiki" id="note082659"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;19:26-27</a></span> From that hour the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother of God remained specially in the care of John, as long as she had her habitation in this life. And when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had divided the world by lot for preaching, she settled in the house of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> near <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount Olivet</a>.</p>

<p>2. In the second year, therefore, after Christ had vanquished death, and ascended up into heaven, on a certain day, Mary, burning with a longing for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, began to weep alone, within the shelter of her abode. And, behold, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, shining in a dress of great light, stood before her and gave utterance to  the words of salutation saying: Hail! You blessed by the Lord, receive the salutation of Him who commanded safety to Jacob by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Behold, said He, a palm branch&mdash; I have brought it to you from the paradise of the Lord&mdash; which you will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be carried before your bier, when on the third day you shall be taken up from the body. For, lo, your Son awaits you with thrones and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and all the powers of heaven. Then Mary said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: I beg that all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> be assembled to me. To whom the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said: Behold, today, by the power of my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> will come to you. And Mary says to him: I ask that you send upon me your blessing, that no power of the lower world may withstand me in that hour in which my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall go out of my body, and that I may not see the prince of darkness. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said: No power indeed of the lower world will hurt you; and your Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose servant and messenger I am, has given you <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessing; but do not think that the privilege of not seeing the prince of darkness is to be given you by me, but by Him whom you have carried in your womb; for to Him belongs power over all for ever and ever. Thus saying, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> departed with great splendour. And that palm shone with exceeding great light. Then Mary, undressing herself, put on better garments. And, taking the palm which she had received from the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, she went out to the mount of Olivet, and began to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and say: I had not been worthy, O Lord, to bear You, unless You had had compassion on me; but nevertheless I have kept the treasure which You entrusted to me. Therefore I ask of You, O King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that the power of Gehenna hurt me not. For if the heavens and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> daily tremble before You, how much more man who is made from the ground, who possesses no good thing, except as much as he has received from Your benignant bounty! You are, O Lord, God always blessed for ever. And thus saying, she went back to her dwelling.</p>

<p>3. And, behold, suddenly, while St. John was preaching in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, on the Lord's day, at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> of the day, there was a great earthquake, and a cloud raised him and took him up from the eyes of all, and brought him before the door of the house where Mary was. And knocking at the door, he immediately went in. And when Mary saw him, she exulted in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and said: I beg of you, my son John, be mindful of the words of my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, in which He entrusted me to you. For, behold, on the third day, when I am to depart from the body,  I have heard the plans of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, saying, Let us wait for the day when she who bore that seducer shall die, and let us burn her body with fire. She therefore called St. John, and led him into the secret chamber of the house, and showed him the robe of her burial, and that palm of light which she had received from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, instructing him that he should <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it to be carried before her couch when she was going to her tomb.</p>

<p>4. And St. John said to her: How shall I alone perform your funeral <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, unless my brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> come to pay <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to your body? And, behold, on a sudden, by the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were snatched up, raised on a cloud, from the places in which they were preaching the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and set down before the door of the house in which Mary dwelt. And, saluting each other, they wondered, saying: What is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for which the Lord has assembled us here? </p>

<p>5. Then all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, rejoicing  with one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, finished their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. And when they had said the <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, behold, on a sudden, there came the blessed John, and told them all these things. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> then, having entered the house, found Mary, and saluted her, saying: Blessed are you by the Lord, who has made heaven and earth. And she said to them: Peace be with you, most beloved brethren! How have you come hither? And they recounted to her how they had come, each one raised on a cloud by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and set down in the same place. And she said to them: God has not deprived me of the sight of you. Behold, I shall go the way of all the earth, and I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that the Lord has now conducted you hither to bring me consolation for the anguish which is just coming upon me. Now therefore I implore you, that without intermission you all with one mind watch, even till that hour in which the Lord will come, and I shall depart from the body.</p>

<p>6. And when they had sat down in a circle consoling her, when they had spent three days in the praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, behold, on the third day, about the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> of the day, a deep sleep seized upon all who were in that house, and no one was at all able to keep awake but the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> alone, and only the three <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who were there. And, behold, suddenly the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> came with a great multitude of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and a great brightness came down upon that place, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were singing a hymn, and praising God together. Then the Saviour spoke, saying: Come, most precious pearl, within the receptacle of life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<p>7. Then Mary prostrated herself on the pavement, adoring <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said: Blessed be the name of Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hast deigned to choose me Your handmaid, and to entrust to me Your hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. Be mindful of me, therefore, O King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, for You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have loved You with all my heart, and kept the treasure committed to me. Therefore receive me, Your servant, and free me from the power of darkness, that no onset of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> may oppose me, and that I may not see filthy spirits standing in my way. And the Saviour answered her: When I, sent by my Father for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world, was hanging on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, the prince of darkness came to me; but when he was able to find in me no trace of his work, <span class="stiki" id="note082664"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;14:30</a></span> he went off vanquished and trodden under foot. But when you shall see him, you shall see him indeed by the law of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, in accordance with which you have come to the end of your life; but he cannot hurt you, because I am with you to help you. Go in security, because the heavenly host is waiting for you to lead you in to the joys of paradise. And when the Lord had thus spoken, Mary, rising from the pavement, reclined upon her couch, and giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, gave up the ghost. And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> saw that her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was of such whiteness, that no tongue of mortals can worthily utter it; for it surpassed all the whiteness of snow, and of every metal, and of gleaming silver, by the great brightness of its light.</p>

<p>8. Then the Saviour spoke, saying: Rise, Peter, and take the body of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, and send it to the right hand side of the city towards the east, and you will find there a new tomb, in which you will lay her, and wait until I come to you. And thus saying, the Lord delivered the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of St. Mary to Michael, who was the ruler of paradise, and the prince of the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>;  and Gabriel went with them. And immediately the Saviour was received up into heaven along with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>9. And the three <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, who were in the same place, and were watching, took up the body of the blessed Mary, that they might wash it after the manner of funeral <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. And when they had taken off her clothes, that sacred body shone with so much brightness, that it could be touched indeed for preparation for burial, but the form of it could not be seen for the excessive flashing light: except that the splendour of the Lord appeared great, and nothing was perceived, the body, when it was washed, was perfectly clean, and stained by no moisture of filth.  And when they had put the dead-clothes on her, that light was gradually obscured. And the body of the blessed Mary was like lily flowers; and an odour of great sweetness came forth from it, so that no sweetness could be found like it.</p>

<p>10. Then, accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> laid the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body on the bier, and said to each other: Who is to carry this palm before her bier? Then John said to Peter: Thou, who hast precedence of us in the apostleship, should carry this palm before her couch. And Peter answered him: You were the only virgin among us chosen by the Lord, and you found so great favour that you reclined upon His breast. <span class="stiki" id="note082667"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;13:23</a></span> And He, when for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> He was hanging upon the stem of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, entrusted her to you with His own mouth. Thou therefore ought to carry this palm, and let us take up that body to carry it even to the place of sepulture.  After this, Peter, raising <em>it, and saying</em>, Take the body, began to sing and say: <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has gone forth out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Alleluiah. And the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> along with him carried the body of the blessed Mary, and John bore the palm of light before the bier. And the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> sang with a most sweet voice.</p>

<p>11. And, behold, a new <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. There appeared above the bier a cloud exceeding great, like the great circle which is wont to appear beside the splendour of the moon; and there was in the clouds an army of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> sending forth a sweet song,  and from the sound of the great sweetness the earth resounded. Then the people, having gone forth from the city, about fifteen thousand, wondered, saying: What is that sound of so great sweetness? Then there stood up one who said to them: Mary has departed from the body, and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> are singing  praises around her. And looking, they saw the couch crowned with great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> singing with a loud voice. And, behold, one of them, who was chief of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in his rank, filled with fury and rage, said to the rest: Behold, the tabernacle of him who disturbed us and all our race, what <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> has it received? And going up, he wished to overturn the bier, and throw the body down to the ground. And immediately his hands dried up from his elbows, and stuck to the couch. And when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> raised the bier, part of him hung, and part of him adhered to the couch; and he was vehemently tormented with pain, while the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were walking and singing. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who were in the clouds smote the people with blindness.</p>

<p>12. Then that chief cried out, saying: I implore you, Saint Peter, do not despise me, I beseech you, in so great an extremity, because I am exceedingly tortured by great torments. Bear in mind that when, in the pr&aelig;torium, the maid that kept the door <span class="stiki" id="note082671"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;18:17</a></span> recognised you, and told the others to revile you, then I spoke good words in your behalf. Then Peter answering, said: It is not for me to give other to you; but if you believe with your whole heart on the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, whom she carried in her womb, and remained a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> after the birth, the compassion of the Lord, which with profuse benignity saves  the unworthy, will give you <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. </p>

<p>To this he replied: Do we not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? But what shall we do? The enemy of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> has blinded our hearts, and confusion has covered our face, lest we should confess the great things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, especially when we ourselves uttered maledictions against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, shouting: His blood be upon us, and upon our children. <span class="stiki" id="note082674"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;27:25</a></span> Then Peter said: Behold, this malediction will hurt him who has remained unfaithful to Him; but to those who turn themselves to God mercy is not denied. And he said: I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all that you say to me; only I implore, have mercy upon me, lest I die.</p>

<p>13. Then Peter made the couch stand still, and said to him: If you believe with all your heart upon the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, your hands will be released from the bier. And when he had said this  his hands were immediately released from the bier, and he began to stand on his feet; but his arms were dried up, and the torture did not go away from him. Then Peter said to him: Go up to the body, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> the couch, and say: I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom she bore, and I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all whatsoever Peter the apostle of God has said to me. And going up, he kissed the couch, and immediately all pain went away from him, and his hands were healed. Then he began greatly to bless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and from the books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to render testimony to the praises of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so that even the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves wondered, and wept for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, praising the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>14. And Peter said to him: Take this palm from the hand of our brother John, and going into the city you will find much people blinded, and declare to them the great things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and whosoever shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, you shall put this palm upon their eyes, and they shall see; but those who will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> shall remain blind. And when he had done so, he found much people blinded, lamenting thus: Woe unto us, because we have been made like the Sodomites struck with blindness.  Nothing now is left to us but to perish. But when they heard the words of the chief who had been cured speaking, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>; and when he put the palm over their eyes, they recovered sight. Five of them remaining in hardness of heart died. And the chief of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> going forth, carried back the palm to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, reporting all things whatsoever had been done.</p>

<p>15. And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, carrying Mary, came to the place of the <a href="../cathen/08503a.htm">Valley of Jehoshaphat</a> which the Lord had showed them; and they laid her in a new <a href="../cathen/14774a.htm">tomb</a>, and closed the <a href="../cathen/14774a.htm">sepulchre</a>. And they themselves sat down at the door of the <a href="../cathen/14774a.htm">tomb</a>, as the Lord had commanded them; and, behold, suddenly the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> came with a great multitude of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, with a halo of great brightness gleaming, and said to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: Peace be with you! And they answered and said: Let Your mercy, O Lord, be upon us, as we have hoped in You.  Then the Saviour spoke to them, saying: Before I ascended to my Father I promised to you, saying that you who have followed me in the regeneration, when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall sit upon the throne of His majesty, will sit, you also, upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note082678"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;19:28</a></span> Her, therefore, did I choose out of the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by the command of my Father, that I should dwell in her. What, therefore, do you wish that I should do to her? Then Peter and the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> said: Lord, You chose beforehand this Your handmaid to become a spotless chamber for Yourself, and us Your servants to minister unto You. Before the ages You foreknew all things along with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, with whom to You and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> there is one Godhead, equal and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power. If, therefore, it were possible to be done in the presence of the power of Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it had seemed to us Your servants to be right that, just as Thou, having vanquished death, reign in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, so, raising up again the body of Your mother, Thou should take her with You in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> into heaven.</p>

<p>16. Then the Saviour said: Let it be according to your opinion. And He ordered the archangel Michael to bring the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of St. Mary. And, behold, the archangel Michael  rolled back the stone from the door of the <a href="../cathen/14774a.htm">tomb</a>; and the Lord said: Arise, my beloved and my nearest <em>relation;</em> you who hast not put on corruption by intercourse with man, suffer not destruction of the body in the <a href="../cathen/14774a.htm">sepulchre</a>. And immediately Mary rose from the <a href="../cathen/14774a.htm">tomb</a>, and blessed the Lord, and falling forward at the feet of the Lord, adored Him, saying: I cannot render sufficient thanks to You, O Lord, for Your boundless benefits which You have deigned to bestow upon me Your handmaiden. May Your name, O Redeemer of the world, God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, be blessed for ever.</p>

<p>17. And kissing her, the Lord went back, and delivered her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, that they should carry it into paradise. And He said to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: Come up to me. And when they had come up He kissed them, and said: Peace be to you! As I have always been with you, so will I be even to the end of the world. And immediately, when the Lord had said this, He was lifted up on a cloud, and taken back into heaven, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> along with Him, carrying the blessed Mary into the paradise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> being taken up in the clouds, returned each into the place allotted  for his preaching, telling the great things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and praising <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who lives and reigns with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, in perfect unity, and in one substance of Godhead, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
