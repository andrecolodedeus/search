<h1>Apology</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>Rulers of the Roman Empire, if, seated for the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> on your lofty tribunal, under the gaze of every eye, and occupying there all but the highest position in the state, you may not openly inquire into and sift before the world the real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in regard to the charges made against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; if in this case alone you are afraid or ashamed to exercise your authority in making public inquiry with the carefulness which becomes <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; if, finally, the extreme severities inflicted on our people in recently private judgments, stand in the way of our being permitted to defend ourselves before you, you cannot surely forbid the Truth to reach your ears by the secret pathway of a noiseless book.  She has no appeals to make to you in regard of her condition, for that does not excite her wonder. She <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that she is but a sojourner on the earth, and that among strangers she naturally finds foes; and more than this, that her origin, her dwelling-place, her hope, her recompense, her honours, are above. One thing, meanwhile, she anxiously desires of earthly rulers&mdash; not to be condemned unknown. What harm can it do to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, supreme in their domain, to give her a hearing? Nay, for that part of it, will not their absolute supremacy be more conspicuous in their condemning her, even after she has made her plea? But if, unheard, sentence is pronounced against her, besides the odium of an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> deed, you will incur the merited suspicion of doing it with some idea that it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, as not wishing to hear what you may not be able to hear and condemn. We lay this before you as the first ground on which we urge that your <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. And the very reason which seems to excuse this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> (I mean <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>) at once aggravates and convicts it. For what is there more unfair than to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> a thing of which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing, even though it deserve to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>? Hatred is only merited when it is <em><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a></em> to be merited. But without that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whence is its <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to be vindicated? For that is to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, not from the mere fact that an aversion exists, but from acquaintance with the subject. When men, then, give way to a dislike simply because they are entirely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing disliked, why may it not be precisely the very sort of thing they should not dislike? So we maintain that they are both <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> while they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us unrighteously while they continue in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, the one thing being the result of the other either way of it. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, at once condemning and excusing their <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, is this, that those who once <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing about it, no sooner come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it than they all lay down at once their enmity. From being its haters they become its <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. By simply getting acquainted with it, they begin now to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> what they had formerly been, and to profess what they had formerly <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>; and their numbers are as great as are laid to our charge. The outcry is that the State is filled with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>&mdash; that they are in the fields, in the citadels, in the islands: they make lamentation, as for some calamity, that both sexes, every age and condition, even high rank, are passing over to the profession of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and yet for all, their minds are not awakened to the thought of some good they have failed to notice in it. They must not allow any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> suspicions to cross their minds; they have no desire to make closer trial. Here alone the curiosity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> slumbers. They like to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, though to others the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has been bliss. Anacharsis reproved the rude venturing to criticise the cultured; how much more this judging of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, by men who are entirely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, might he have denounced! Because they already dislike, they want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no more. Thus they prejudge that of which they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> to be such, that, if they came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, it could no longer be the object of their aversion; since, if inquiry finds nothing worthy of dislike, it is certainly proper to cease from an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> dislike, while if its bad character comes plainly out, instead of the detestation entertained for it being thus diminished, a stronger reason for perseverance in that detestation is obtained, even under the authority of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> itself. But, says one, a thing is not good merely because multitudes go over to it; for how many have the bent of their nature towards whatever is bad! How many go astray into ways of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>! It is undoubted. Yet a thing that is thoroughly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not even those whom it carries away venture to defend as good. Nature throws a veil either of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or shame over all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For instance, you find that criminals are eager to conceal themselves, avoid appearing in public, are in trepidation when they are caught, deny their guilt, when they are accused; even when they are put to the rack, they do not easily or always confess; when there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about their condemnation, they grieve for what they have done. In their self-communings they admit their being impelled by sinful dispositions, but they lay the blame either on <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> or on the stars. They are unwilling to acknowledge that the thing is theirs, because they own that it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. But what is there like this in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian's</a> case? The only shame or regret he feels, is at not having been a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> earlier. If he is pointed out, he glories in it; if he is accused, he offers no defence; interrogated, he makes <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> confession; condemned he renders thanks. What sort of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing is this, which wants all the ordinary peculiarities of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, shame, subterfuge, penitence, lamenting? What! Is that a crime in which the criminal rejoices? To be accused of which is his ardent wish, to be punished for which is his felicity? You cannot call it <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, you who stand convicted of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing of the matter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>If, again, it is certain that we are the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, why do you treat us so differently from our fellows, that is, from other criminals, it being only fair that the same crime should get the same treatment? When the charges made against us are made against others, they are permitted to make use both of their own lips and of hired pleaders to show their innocence. They have full opportunity of answer and debate; in fact, it is against the law to condemn anybody undefended and unheard. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> alone are forbidden to say anything in exculpation of themselves, in defence of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to help the judge to a righteous decision; all that is cared about is having what the public <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> demands&mdash; the confession of the name, not examination of the charge: while in your ordinary judicial investigations, on a man's confession of the crime of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, or sacrilege, or incest, or treason, to take the points of which we are accused, you are not content to proceed at once to sentence&mdash;you do not take that step till you thoroughly examine the circumstances of the confession&mdash; what is the real character of the deed, how often, where, in what way, when he has done it, who were privy to it, and who actually took part with him in it. Nothing like this is done in our case, though the falsehoods disseminated about us ought to have the same sifting, that it might be found how many murdered children each of us had tasted; how many incests each of us had shrouded in darkness; what cooks, what dogs had been <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Oh, how great the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the ruler who should bring to light some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> who had devoured a hundred infants! But, instead of that, we find that even inquiry in regard to our case is forbidden. For the younger Pliny, when he was ruler of a province, having condemned some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to death, and driven some from their steadfastness, being still annoyed by their great numbers, at last sought the advice of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>,  the reigning emperor, as to what he was to do with the rest, explaining to his master that, except an obstinate disinclination to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, he found in the religious services nothing but meetings at early morning for singing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to Christ and  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and sealing home their way of life by a united pledge to be faithful to their religion, forbidding <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, dishonesty, and other crimes. Upon this <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> wrote back that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were by no means to be sought after; but if they were brought before him, they should be punished. O miserable deliverance&mdash;under the necessities of the case, a self-contradiction! It forbids them to be sought after as innocent, and it commands them to be punished as guilty. It is at once merciful and cruel; it passes by, and it punishes. Why do you play a game of evasion upon yourself, O Judgment? If you condemn, why do you not also inquire. If you do not inquire, why do you not also absolve? Military stations are distributed through all the provinces for tracking <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>. Against traitors and public foes every man is a soldier; search is made even for their confederates and accessories. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> alone must not be sought, though he may be brought and accused before the judge; as if a search had any other end than that in view! And so you condemn the man for whom nobody wished a search to be made when he is presented to you, and who even now does not deserve punishment, I suppose, because of his guilt, but because, though forbidden to be sought, he was found. And then, too, you do not in that case deal with us in the ordinary way of judicial proceedings against offenders; for, in the case of others denying, you apply the torture to make them confess&mdash; <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> alone you torture, to make them deny; whereas, if we were guilty of any crime, we should be sure to deny it, and you with your tortures would force us to confession. Nor indeed should you hold that our crimes require no such investigation merely on the ground that you are convinced by our confession of the name that the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> were done&mdash; <em>you</em> who are daily wont, though you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well enough what <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is, none the less to extract from the confessed murderer a full account of how the crime was perpetrated. So that with all the greater perversity you act, when, holding our crimes <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by our confession of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you drive us by torture to fall from our confession, that, repudiating the name, we may in like manner repudiate also the crimes with which, from that same confession, you had assumed that we were chargeable. I suppose, though you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> us to be the worst of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, you do not wish us to perish. For thus, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, you are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of bidding the murderer deny, and of ordering the man guilty of sacrilege to the rack if he persevere in his acknowledgment! Is that the way of it? But if thus you do not deal with us as criminals, you declare us thereby innocent, when as innocent you are anxious that we do not persevere in a confession which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> will bring on us a condemnation of necessity, not of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, at your hands. <q>I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>,</q> the man cries out. He tells you what he is; you wish to hear from him what he is not. Occupying your place of authority to extort the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you do your utmost to get lies from us. <q>I am,</q> he says, that which you ask me if I am. Why do you torture me to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? I confess, and you put me to the rack. What would you do if I denied? Certainly you give no ready credence to others when they deny. When we deny, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> at once. Let this perversity of yours lead you to suspect that there is some hidden power in the case under whose influence you act against the forms, against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of public <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, even against the very <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> themselves. For, unless I am greatly mistaken, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> enjoin offenders to be searched out, and not to be hidden away. They lay it down that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who own a crime are to be condemned, not acquitted. The decrees of the senate, the commands of your chiefs, lay this clearly down. The power of which you are servants is a civil, not a tyrannical domination. Among tyrants, indeed, torments used to be inflicted even as punishments: with you they are mitigated to a means of questioning alone. Keep to your law in these as necessary till confession is obtained; and if the torture is anticipated by confession, there will be no occasion for it: sentence should be passed; the criminal should be given over to the penalty which is his due, not released. Accordingly, no one is eager for the acquittal of the guilty; it is not right to desire that, and so no one is ever compelled to deny. Well, you think the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> a man of every crime, an enemy of the gods, of the emperor, of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, of good morals, of all nature; yet you compel him to deny, that you may acquit him, which without him denial you could not do. You play fast and loose with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. You wish him to deny his guilt, that you may, even against his will, bring him out blameless and free from all guilt in reference to the past! Whence is this strange perversity on your part? How is it you do not reflect that a spontaneous confession is greatly more worthy of credit than a compelled denial; or consider whether, when compelled to deny, a man's denial may not be in good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and whether acquitted, he may not, then and there, as soon as the trial is over, laugh at your hostility, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> as much as ever? Seeing, then, that in everything you deal differently with us than with other criminals, bent upon the one object of taking from us our name (indeed, it is ours no more if we do what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> never do), it is made perfectly clear that there is no crime of any kind in the case, but merely a name which a certain system, ever working against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, pursues with its enmity, doing this chiefly with the object of securing that men may have no desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain they are entirely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of. Hence, too, it is that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> about us things of which they have no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, and they are disinclined to have them looked into, lest the charges, they would rather take on trust, are all <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have no foundation, that the name so hostile to that rival power&mdash; its crimes presumed, not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>&mdash; may be condemned simply on its own confession. So we are put to the torture if we confess, and we are punished if we persevere, and if we deny we are acquitted, because all the contention is about a name. Finally, why do you read out of your tablet-lists that such a man is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? Why not also that he is a murderer? And if a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is a murderer, why not guilty, too, of incest, or any other vile thing you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> of us? In our case alone you are either ashamed or unwilling to mention the very names of our crimes&mdash; If to be called a <q><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a></q> does not imply any crime, the name is surely very hateful, when that of itself is made a crime.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>What are we to think of it, that most people so blindly knock their heads against the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name; that when they bear favourable testimony to any one, they mingle with it abuse of the name he bears? <q>A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man,</q> says one, <q>is Gaius Seius, only that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</q> So another, <q>I am astonished that a wise man like Lucius should have suddenly become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</q> Nobody thinks it needful to consider whether Gaius is not good and Lucius wise, on this very account that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; or a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, for the reason that he is wise and good. They praise what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, they abuse what they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, and they inspire their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; though in fairness you should rather judge of what is unknown from what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, than what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from what is unknown. Others, in the case of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom, before they took the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as loose, and vile, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, put on them a brand from the very thing which they praise. In the blindness of their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, they fall foul of their own approving judgment! <q>What a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> she was! How wanton! How gay! What a youth he was! How profligate! How libidinous!&mdash; they have become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>!</q> So the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> name is given to a reformation of character. Some even barter away their comforts for that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, content to bear injury, if they are kept free at home from the object of their bitter enmity. The wife, now chaste, the husband, now no longer jealous, casts out of his house; the son, now <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, the father, who used to be so patient, disinherits; the servant, now faithful, the master, once so mild, commands away from his presence; it is a high offense for any one to be reformed by the detested name. Goodness is of less value than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Well now, if there is this dislike of the name, what blame can you attach to names? What accusation can you bring against mere designations, save that something in the word sounds either barbarous, or unlucky, or scurrilous, or unchaste? But <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, so far as the meaning of the word is concerned, is derived from anointing. Yes, and even when it is wrongly pronounced by you <q>Chrestianus</q> (for you do not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> accurately the name you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>), it comes from sweetness and benignity. You <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, therefore, in the guiltless, even a guiltless name. But the special ground of dislike to the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> is, that it bears the name of its Founder. Is there anything new in a religious <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> getting for its followers a designation from its master? Are not the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> called from the founders of <em>their</em> systems&mdash; Platonists, <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, Pythagoreans? Are not the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> and Academics so called also from the places in which they assembled and stationed themselves? And are not physicians named from Erasistratus, grammarians from Aristarchus, cooks even from Apicius? And yet the bearing of the name, transmitted from the original institutor with whatever he has instituted, offends no one. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, if it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> is a bad one, and so its founder bad as well, that will prove that the name is bad and deserves our aversion, in respect of the character both of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> and its author. Before, therefore, taking up a dislike to the name, it behooved you to consider the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> in the author, or the author in the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. But now, without any sifting and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of either, the mere name is made matter of accusation, the mere name is assailed, and a sound alone brings condemnation on a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> and its author both, while of both you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, because they have such and such a designation, not because they are convicted of anything wrong.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>And so, having made these remarks as it were by way of preface, that I might show in its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> colours the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of the public <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against us, I shall now take my stand on the plea of our blamelessness; and I shall not only refute the things which are objected to us, but I shall also retort them on the objectors, that in this way all may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are free from the very crimes they are so well aware prevail among themselves, that they may at the same time be put to the blush for their accusations against us&mdash;accusations I shall not say of the worst of men against the best, but now, as they will have it, against those who are only their fellows in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. We shall reply to the accusation of all the various crimes we are said to be guilty of in secret, such as we find them committing in the light of day, and as being guilty of which we are held to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, senseless, worthy of punishment, deserving of ridicule. But since, when our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> meets you successfully at all points, the authority of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as a last resort is set up against it, so that it is either said that their determinations are absolutely conclusive, or the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is, however unwillingly, preferred to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I shall first, in this matter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> grapple with you as with their chosen protectors. Now first, when you sternly lay it down in your sentences, <q>It is not lawful for you to exist,</q> and with unhesitating rigour you enjoin this to be carried out, you exhibit the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> domination of mere tyranny, if you deny the thing to be lawful, simply on the ground that you wish it to be unlawful, not because it ought to be. But if you would have it unlawful because it <em>ought</em> not to be lawful, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that should have no permission of law which does harm; and on this ground, in fact, it is already determined that whatever is beneficial is legitimate. Well, if I have found what your law prohibits to be good, as one who has arrived at such a previous opinion, has it not lost its power to debar me from it, though that very thing, if it were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it would <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> forbid to me? If your law has gone wrong, it is of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> origin, I think; it has not fallen from heaven. Is it wonderful that man should <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in making a law, or come to his senses in rejecting it? Did not the Laced&aelig;monians amend the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Lycurgus himself, thereby inflicting such pain on their author that he shut himself up, and doomed himself to death by starvation? Are you not yourselves every day, in your efforts to illumine the darkness of antiquity, cutting and hewing with the new axes of imperial rescripts and edicts, that whole ancient and rugged forest of your <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>? Has not Severus, that most resolute of rulers, but yesterday repealed the ridiculous Papian <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>  which compelled people to have children before the Julian <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> allow matrimony to be contracted, and that though they have the authority of age upon their side? There were <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, too, in old times, that parties against whom a decision had been given might be cut in pieces by their creditors; however, by common consent that cruelty was afterwards erased from the statutes, and the capital penalty turned into a brand of shame. By adopting the plan of confiscating a debtor's goods, it was sought rather to pour the blood in blushes over his face than to pour it out. How many <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> lie hidden out of sight which still require to be reformed! For it is neither the number of their years nor the dignity of their maker that commends them, but simply that they are just; and therefore, when their <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is recognized, they are deservedly condemned, even though they condemn. Why speak we of them as <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>? Nay, if they punish mere names, we may well call them irrational. But if they punish acts, why in our case do they punish acts solely on the ground of a name, while in others they must have them <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> not from the name, but from the wrong done? I am a practiser of incest (so they say); why do they not inquire into it? I am an infant-killer; why do they not apply the torture to get from me the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? I am guilty of crimes against the gods, against the C&aelig;sars; why am I, who am able to clear myself, not allowed to be heard on my own behalf? No law forbids the sifting of the crimes which it prohibits, for a judge never inflicts a righteous vengeance if he is not well assured that a crime has been committed; nor does a citizen render a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> subjection to the law, if he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing on which the punishment is inflicted. It is not enough that a law is just, nor that the judge should be convinced of its <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; those from whom <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is expected should have that conviction too. Nay, a law lies under strong suspicions which does not care to have itself tried and approved: it is a positively <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> law, if, unproved, it tyrannizes over men.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>To say a word about the origin of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the kind to which we now refer, there was an old decree that no god should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the emperor till first approved by the senate. Marcus &AElig;milius had experience of this in reference to his god Alburnus. And this, too, makes for our case, that among you divinity is allotted at the judgment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings. Unless gods give satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, there will be no deification for them: the god will have to propitiate the man. Tiberius   accordingly, in whose days the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name made its entry into the world, having himself received intelligence from Palestine of events which had clearly shown the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> divinity, brought the matter before the senate, with his own decision in favour of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The senate, because it had not given the approval itself, rejected his proposal. C&aelig;sar held to his opinion, threatening <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against all accusers of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Consult your histories; you will there find that <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> was the first who assailed with the imperial sword the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, making progress then especially at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But we <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in having our condemnation hallowed by the hostility of such a wretch. For any one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> him, can understand that not except as being of singular excellence did anything bring on it <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> condemnation. <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, too, a man of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> type in cruelty, tried his hand at <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; but as he had something of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> in him, he soon put an end to what he had begun, even restoring again those whom he had banished. Such as these have always been our persecutors,&mdash; men <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, impious, base, of whom even you yourselves have no good to say, the sufferers under whose sentences you have been wont to restore. But among so many princes from that time to the present day, with anything of divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom in them, point out a single persecutor of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name. So far from that, we, on the contrary, bring before you one who was their protector, as you will see by examining the letters of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>, that most grave of emperors, in which he bears his testimony that that Germanic drought was removed by the rains obtained through the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who chanced to be fighting under him. And as he did not by public law remove from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> their legal disabilities, yet in another way he put them openly aside, even adding a sentence of condemnation, and that of greater severity, against their accusers. What sort of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are these which the impious alone execute against us&mdash; and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, the vile, the bloody, the senseless, the insane? Which <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> to some extent made naught by forbidding <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to be sought after; which neither a <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Hadrian</a>, though fond of searching into all things strange and new, nor a <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, though the subjugator of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nor a <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Pius</a>, nor a Verus, ever enforced? It should surely be judged more natural for bad men to be eradicated by good princes as being their natural enemies, than by those of a spirit kindred with their own.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>I would now have these most religious protectors and vindicators of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and institutions of their fathers, tell me, in regard to their own fidelity and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and submission they themselves show to ancestral institutions, if they have departed from nothing&mdash; if they have in nothing gone out of the old paths&mdash; if they have not put aside whatsoever is most useful and necessary as rules of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life. What has become of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> repressing expensive and ostentatious ways of living? Which forbade more than a hundred <em>asses</em> to be expended on a supper, and more than one fowl to be set on the table at a time, and that not a fatted one; which expelled a patrician from the senate on the serious ground, as it was counted, of aspiring to be too great, because he had acquired ten pounds of silver; which put down the theatres as quickly as they arose to debauch the manners of the people; which did not permit the insignia of official dignities or of noble birth to be rashly or with impunity usurped? For I see the Centenarian suppers must now bear the name, not from the hundred asses, but from the hundred sestertia  expended on them; and that mines of silver are made into dishes (it were little if this applied only to senators, and not to freedmen or even mere whip-spoilers ). I see, too, that neither is a single theatre enough, nor are theatres unsheltered: no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it was that immodest pleasure might not be torpid in the wintertime, the Laced&aelig;monians invented their woollen cloaks for the plays. I see now no difference between the dress of matrons and prostitutes. In regard to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, indeed, those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of your fathers, which used to be such an encouragement to modesty and sobriety, have also fallen into desuetude, when a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> no gold upon her save on the finger, which, with the bridal ring, her husband had sacredly pledged to himself; when the abstinence of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> from wine was carried so far, that a matron, for opening the compartments of a wine cellar, was starved to death by her friends&mdash;while in the times of Romulus, for merely tasting wine, Mecenius killed his wife, and suffered nothing for the deed. With reference to this also, it was the custom of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, that they might be detected by their breath. Where is that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of married life, ever so desirable, which distinguished our earlier manners, and as the result of which for about 600 years there was not among us a single <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>? Now, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have every member of the body heavy laden with gold; wine-bibbing is so common among them, that the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> is never offered with their will; and as for <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, they long for it as though it were the natural consequence of marriage. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, too, your fathers in their wisdom had enacted concerning the very gods themselves, you their most loyal children have rescinded. The consuls, by the authority of the senate, banished Father Bacchus and his <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> not merely from the city, but from the whole of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The consuls Piso and Gabinius, no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> surely, forbade Serapis, and Isis, and Arpocrates, with their dogheaded friend,  admission into the Capitol&mdash; in the act casting them out from the assembly of the gods&mdash; overthrow their altars, and expelled them from the country, being anxious to prevent the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of their base and lascivious religion from spreading. These, you have restored, and conferred highest honours on them. What has come to your religion&mdash; of the veneration due by you to your ancestors? In your dress, in your food, in your style of life, in your opinions, and last of all in your very speech, you have renounced your progenitors. You are always praising antiquity, and yet every day you have novelties in your way of living. From your having failed to maintain what you should, you make it clear, that, while you abandon the good ways of your fathers, you retain and guard the things you ought not. Yet the very tradition of your fathers, which you still seem so faithfully to defend, and in which you find your principal matter of accusation against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>&mdash; I mean <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the worship of the gods, the point in which antiquity has mainly erred&mdash; although you have rebuilt the altars of Serapis, now a Roman deity, and to Bacchus, now become a god of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, you offer up your orgies,&mdash; I shall in its proper place show that you despise, neglect, and overthrow, casting entirely aside the authority of the men of old. I go on meantime to reply to that <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> charge of secret crimes, clearing my way to things of open day.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>Monsters of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, we are accused of observing a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> rite in which we kill a little child and then eat it; in which, after the feast, we practise incest, the dogs&mdash; our pimps, forsooth, overturning the lights and getting us the shamelessness of darkness for our impious <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>. This is what is constantly laid to our charge, and yet you take no pains to elicit the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of what we have been so long accused. Either bring, then, the matter to the light of day if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it, or give it no credit as having never inquired into it. On the ground of your double dealing, we are entitled to lay it down to you that there is no reality in the thing which you dare not expiscate. You impose on the executioner, in the case of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, a duty the very opposite of expiscation: he is not to make them confess what they do, but to make them deny what they are. We date the origin of our religion, as we have mentioned before, from the reign of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>. Truth and the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> come into our world together. As soon as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> appears, it is regarded as an enemy. It has as many foes as there are strangers to it: the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as was to be looked for, from a spirit of rivalry; the soldiers, out of a desire to extort money; our very domestics, by their nature. We are daily beset by foes, we are daily betrayed; we are oftentimes surprised in our meetings and congregations. Whoever happened withal upon an infant wailing, according to the common story? Whoever kept for the judge, just as he had found them, the gory mouths of Cyclops and Sirens? Whoever found any traces of uncleanness in their wives? Where is the man who, when he had discovered such atrocities, concealed them; or, in the act of dragging the culprits before the judge, was <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribed</a> into silence? If we always keep our secrets, when were our proceedings made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the world? Nay, by whom could they be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>? Not, surely, by the guilty parties themselves; even from the very idea of the thing, the fealty of silence being ever due to <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. The Samothracian and Eleusinian make no disclosures&mdash; how much more will silence be kept in regard to such as are sure, in their unveiling, to call forth punishment from man at once, while <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> divine is kept in store for the future? If, then, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are not themselves the publishers of their crime, it follows of course it must be strangers. And whence have they their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, when it is also a universal custom in religious initiations to keep the profane aloof, and to beware of witnesses, unless it be that those who are so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> have less <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> than their neighbors? Every one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what sort of thing rumour is. It is one of your own sayings, that <q>among all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, none flies so fast as rumour.</q> Why is rumour such an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing? Is it because it is fleet? Is it because it carries information? Or is it because it is in the highest degree mendacious?&mdash; a thing, not even when it brings some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to us, without a taint of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, either detracting, or adding, or changing from the simple fact? Nay more, it is the very law of its being to continue only while it lies, and to live but so long as there is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>; for when the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is given, it ceases to exist; and, as having done its work of merely spreading a report, it delivers up a fact, and is henceforth held to be a fact, and called a fact. And then no one says, for instance, <q>They say that it took place at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>,</q> or, <q>There is a rumour that he has obtained a province,</q> but, <q>He has got a province,</q> and, <q>It took place at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</q> Rumour, the very designation of uncertainty, has no place when a thing is certain. Does any but a fool put his trust in it? For a wise man never believes the dubious. Everybody <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, however <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> it is spread abroad, on whatever strength of asseveration it rests, that some time or other from some one fountain it has its origin. Thence it must creep into propagating tongues and ears; and a small seminal blemish so darkens all the rest of the story, that no one can determine whether the lips, from which it first came forth, planted the seed of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, as often happens, from a spirit of opposition, or from a suspicious judgment, or from a confirmed, nay, in the case of some, an inborn, delight in lying. It is well that time brings all to light, as your proverbs and sayings testify, by a provision of Nature, which has so appointed things that nothing long is hidden, even though rumour has not disseminated it. It is just then as it should be, that fame for so long a period has been alone aware of the crimes of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. This is the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> you bring against us&mdash; one that has never been able to prove the accusation it some time or other sent abroad, and at last by mere continuance made into a settled opinion in the world; so that I confidently appeal to Nature herself, ever <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, against those who groundlessly hold that such things are to be credited.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>See now, we set before you the reward of these enormities. They give promise of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Hold it meanwhile as your own belief. I ask you, then, whether, so believing, you think it worth attaining with a <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> such as you will have. Come, plunge your knife into the babe, enemy of none, accused of none, child of all; or if that is another's work, simply take your place beside a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being dying before he has really lived, await the departure of the lately given <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, receive the fresh young blood, saturate your bread with it, freely partake. The while as you recline at table, take note of the places which your mother and your sister occupy; mark them well, so that when the dog-made darkness has fallen on you, you may make no mistake, for you will be guilty of a crime&mdash; unless you perpetrate a deed of incest. Initiated and sealed into things like these, you have life everlasting. Tell me, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> worth it? If it is not, then these things are not to be credited. Even although you had the belief, I deny the will; and even if you had the will, I deny the possibility. Why then can others do it, if you cannot? Why cannot you, if others can? I suppose we are of a different nature&mdash; are we Cynop&aelig; or Sciapodes?  You are a man yourself as well as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>: if you cannot do it, you ought not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it of others, for a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is a man as well as you. But the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, forsooth, are deceived and imposed on. They were quite unaware of anything of the kind being imputed to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, or they would certainly have looked into it for themselves, and searched the matter out. Instead of that, it is the custom for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> wishing initiation into sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, I think, to go first of all to the master of them, that he may explain what preparations are to be made. Then, in this case, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he would say, <q>You must have a child still of tender age, that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what it is to die, and can smile under your knife; bread, too, to collect the gushing blood; in addition to these, candlesticks, and lamps, and dogs&mdash; with tid-bits to draw them on to the extinguishing of the lights: above all things, you will require to bring your mother and your sister with you.</q> But what if mother and sister are unwilling? Or if there be neither the one nor the other? What if there are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>? He will not be counted, I suppose, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> follower of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who has not a brother or a son. And what now, if these things are all in store for them without their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? At least afterwards they come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them; and they bear with them, and pardon them. They <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, it may be said, lest they have to pay for it if they let the secret out: nay, but they will rather in that case have every claim to protection; they will even prefer, one might think, dying by their own hand, to living under the burden of such a dreadful <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Admit that they have this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; yet why do they still persevere? For it is plain enough that you will have no desire to continue what you would never have been, if you had had previous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>That I may refute more thoroughly these charges, I will show that in part openly, in part secretly, practices prevail among you which have led you perhaps to credit similar things about us. Children were openly <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> in Africa to Saturn as lately as the proconsulship of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, who exposed to public gaze the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> suspended on the sacred trees overshadowing their temple&mdash; so many crosses on which the punishment which <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> craved overtook their crimes, as the soldiers of our country still can testify who did that very work for that proconsul. And even now that sacred crime still continues to be done in secret. It is not only <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, you see, who despise you; for all that you do there is neither any crime thoroughly and abidingly eradicated, nor does any of your gods reform his ways. When Saturn did not spare his own children, he was not likely to spare the children of others; whom indeed the very <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> themselves were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of offering, gladly responding to the call which was made on them, and keeping the little ones pleased on the occasion, that they might not die in tears. At the same time, there is a vast difference between homicide and parricide. A more advanced age was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to Mercury in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>. I hand over the Tauric fables to their own theatres. Why, even in that most religious city of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> descendants of &AElig;neas, there is a certain Jupiter whom in their games they lave with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blood. It is the blood of a beast-fighter, you say. Is it less, because of that, the blood of a man?  Or is it viler blood because it is from the veins of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man? At any rate it is shed in <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. O Jove, yourself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> only son of your father in his cruelty! But in regard to child <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, as it does not matter whether it is committed for a sacred object, or merely at one's own self-impulse&mdash; although there is a great difference, as we have said, between parricide and homicide&mdash; I shall turn to the people generally. How many, think you, of those crowding around and gaping for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> blood,&mdash; how many even of your rulers, notable for their <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to you and for their severe measures against us, may I charge in their own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of putting their offspring to death? As to any difference in the kind of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, it is certainly the more cruel way to kill by drowning, or by exposure to cold and hunger and dogs. A maturer age has always preferred death by the sword. In our case, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> being once for all forbidden, we may not destroy even the f&oelig;tus in the womb, while as yet the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being derives blood from other parts of the body for its sustenance. To hinder a birth is merely a speedier man-killing; nor does it matter whether you take away a life that is born, or destroy one that is coming to the birth. That is a man which is going to be one; you have the fruit already in its seed. As to meals of blood and such tragic dishes, read&mdash; I am not sure where it is told (it is in Herodotus, I think)&mdash; how blood taken from the arms, and tasted by both parties, has been the treaty bond among some nations. I am not sure what it was that was tasted in the time of Catiline. They say, too, that among some Scythian tribes the dead are eaten by their friends. But I am going far from home. At this day, among ourselves, blood <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Bellona, blood drawn from a punctured thigh and then partaken of, seals initiation into the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of that goddess. Those, too, who at the gladiator shows, for the cure of epilepsy, quaff with greedy thirst the blood of criminals slain in the arena, as it flows fresh from the wound, and then rush off&mdash; to whom do they belong? Those, also, who make meals on the flesh of wild beasts at the place of combat&mdash; who have keen appetites for bear and stag? That bear in the struggle was bedewed with the blood of the man whom it lacerated: that stag rolled itself in the gladiator's gore. The entrails of the very bears, loaded with as yet undigested <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> viscera, are in great request. And you have men rifting up man-fed flesh? If you partake of food like this, how do your repasts differ from those you accuse us <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of? And do those, who, with savage <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, seize on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies, do less because they devour the living? Have they less the pollution of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blood on them because they only lick up what is to turn into blood? They make meals, it is plain, not so much of infants, as of grown-up men. Blush for your vile ways before the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who have not even the blood of animals at their meals of simple and natural food; who abstain from things strangled and that die a natural death, for no other reason than that they may not contract pollution, so much as from blood secreted in the viscera. To clench the matter with a single example, you tempt <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with sausages of blood, just because you are perfectly aware that the thing by which you thus try to get them to transgress they hold unlawful.  And how unreasonable it is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that those, of whom you are convinced that they regard with horror the idea of tasting the blood of oxen, are eager after blood of men; unless, perhaps, you have tried it, and found it sweeter to the taste! Nay, in fact, there is here a test you should apply to discover <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, as well as the fire-pan and the censer. They should be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by their appetite for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blood, as well as by their refusal to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; just as otherwise they should be affirmed to be free of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by their refusal to taste of blood, as by their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a>; and there would be no want of blood of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, amply supplied as that would be in the trial and condemnation of prisoners. Then who are more given to the crime of incest than those who have enjoyed the instruction of Jupiter himself? Ctesias tells us that the Persians have illicit intercourse with their mothers. The Macedonians, too, are suspected on this point; for on first hearing the tragedy of &OElig;dipus they made mirth of the incest-doer's grief, exclaiming, <span class="greek"><!--k29--&#x1FFE;&#x1F25;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B5; &#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x03BC;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x1F73;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;</span> . Even now reflect what opportunity there is for mistakes leading to incestuous comminglings&mdash; your promiscuous looseness supplying the materials. You first of all expose your children, that they may be taken up by any compassionate passer-by, to whom they are quite unknown; or you give them away, to be adopted by those who will do better to them the part of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Well, some time or other, all memory of the alienated progeny must be lost; and when once a mistake has been made, the transmission of incest thence will still go on&mdash; the race and the crime creeping on together. Then, further, wherever you are&mdash; at home, abroad, over the seas&mdash; your <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is an attendant, whose general indulgence, or even its indulgence in the most limited scale, may easily and unwittingly anywhere beget children, so that in this way a progeny scattered about in the commerce of life may have intercourse with those who are their own kin, and have no notion that there is any incest in the case. A persevering and steadfast <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> has protected us from anything like this: keeping as we do from adulteries and all post-matrimonial unfaithfulness, we are not exposed to incestuous mishaps. Some of us, making matters still more secure, beat away from them entirely the power of sensual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> continence, still boys in this respect when they are old. If you would but take notice that such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as I have mentioned prevail among you, that would lead you to see that they have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The same eyes would tell you of both facts. But the two blindnesses are apt to go together; so that those who do not see what is, think they see what is not. I shall show it to be so in everything. But now let me speak of matters which are more clear.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><q>You do not worship the gods,</q> you say; <q>and you do not offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for the emperors.</q> Well, we do not offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for others, for the same reason that we do not for ourselves&mdash;namely, that your gods are not at all the objects of our worship. So we are accused of sacrilege and treason. This is the chief ground of charge against us&mdash; nay, it is the sum-total of our offending; and it is worthy then of being inquired into, if neither prejudice nor <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> be the judge, the one of which has no idea of discovering the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the other simply and at once rejects it. We do not worship your gods, because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there are no such beings. This, therefore, is what you should do: you should call on us to demonstrate their non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and thereby prove that they have no claim to adoration; for only if your gods were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> so, would there be any obligation to render divine homage to them. And punishment even were due to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, if it were made plain that those to whom they refused all worship were indeed divine. But you say, They are gods. We protest and appeal from yourselves to your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; let that judge us; let that condemn us, if it can deny that all these gods of yours were but men. If even it venture to deny that, it will be confuted by its own books of antiquities, from which it has got its information about them, bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to this day, as they plainly do, both of the cities in which they were born, and the countries in which they have left traces of their exploits, as well as where also they are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have been buried. Shall I now, therefore, go over them one by one, so numerous and so various, new and old, barbarian, Grecian, Roman, foreign, captive and adopted, private and common, male and female, rural and urban, naval and military? It were useless even to hunt out all their names: so I may content myself with a compend; and this not for your information, but that you may have what you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> brought to your recollection, for undoubtedly you act as if you had forgotten all about them. No one of your gods is earlier than Saturn: from him you trace all your deities, even those of higher rank and better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. What, then, can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of the first, will apply to those that follow. So far, then, as books give us information, neither the Greek Diodorus or Thallus, neither Cassius Severus or Cornelius Nepos, nor any writer upon sacred antiquities, have ventured to say that Saturn was any but a man: so far as the question depends on facts, I find none more trustworthy than those&mdash; that in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> itself we have the country in which, after many expeditions, and after having partaken of Attic hospitalities, Saturn settled, obtaining cordial welcome from Janus, or, as the Salii will have it, Janis. The mountain on which he dwelt was called Saturnius; the city he founded is called Saturnia to this day; last of all, the whole of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, after having borne the name of Oenotria, was called Saturnia from him. He first gave you the art of writing, and a stamped coinage, and thence it is he presides over the public treasury. But if Saturn were a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he had undoubtedly a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> origin; and having a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> origin, he was not the offspring of heaven and earth. As his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were unknown, it was not unnatural that he should be spoken of as the son of those elements from which we might all seem to spring. For who does not speak of heaven and earth as father and mother, in a sort of way of veneration and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>? Or from the custom which prevails among us of saying that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of whom we have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or who make a sudden appearance, have fallen from the skies? In this way it came about that Saturn, everywhere a sudden and unlooked-for guest, got everywhere the name of the Heaven-born. For even the common folk call <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whose stock is unknown, sons of earth. I say nothing of how men in these rude times were wont to act, when they were impressed by the look of any stranger happening to appear among them, as though it were divine, since even at this day men of culture make gods of those whom, a day or two before, they acknowledged to be dead men by their public mourning for them. Let these notices of Saturn, brief as they are, suffice. It will thus also be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that Jupiter is as certainly a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as from a man he sprung; and that one after another the whole swarm is mortal like the primal stock.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>And since, as you dare not deny that these deities of yours once were men, you have taken it on you to assert that they were made gods after their decease, let us consider what necessity there was for this. In the first place, you must concede the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of one higher God&mdash; a certain wholesale dealer in divinity, who has made gods of men. For they could neither have assumed a divinity which was not theirs, nor could any but one himself possessing it have conferred it on them. If there was no one to make gods, it is vain to dream of gods being made when thus you have no god-maker. Most certainly, if they could have deified themselves, with a higher state at their command, they never would have been men. If, then, there be one who is able to make gods, I turn back to an examination of any reason there may be for making gods at all; and I find no other reason than this, that the great God has need of their ministrations and aids in performing the offices of Deity. But first it is an unworthy idea that He should need the help of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and in fact a dead man, when, if He was to be in want of this assistance from the dead, He might more fittingly have created some one a god at the beginning. Nor do I see any place for his action. For this entire world-mass&mdash; whether self-existent and uncreated, as Pythagoras maintains, or brought into being by a creator's hands, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> holds&mdash; was manifestly, once for all in its original construction, disposed, and furnished, and ordered, and supplied with a government of perfect wisdom. That cannot be imperfect which has made all perfect. There was nothing waiting on for Saturn and his race to do. Men will make fools of themselves if they refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that from the very first rain poured down from the sky, and stars gleamed, and light shone, and thunders roared, and Jove himself dreaded the lightnings you put in his hands; that in like manner before Bacchus, and Ceres, and Minerva, nay before the first man, whoever that was, every kind of fruit burst forth plentifully from the bosom of the earth, for nothing provided for the support and sustenance of man could be introduced after his entrance on the stage of being. Accordingly, these necessaries of life are said to have been discovered, not created. But the thing you discover <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before; and that which had a pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> must be regarded as belonging not to him who discovered it, but to him who made it, for of course it had a being before it could be found. But if, on account of his being the discoverer of the vine, Bacchus is raised to godship, Lucullus, who first introduced the cherry from <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, has not been fairly dealt with; for as the discoverer of a new fruit, he has not, as though he were its creator, been awarded divine honours. Wherefore, if the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from the beginning, thoroughly furnished with its system working under certain <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the performance of its functions, there is, in this respect, an entire absence of all reason for electing humanity to divinity; for the positions and powers which you have assigned to your deities have been from the beginning precisely what they would have been, although you had never deified them. But you turn to another reason, telling us that the conferring of deity was a way of rewarding worth. And hence you grant, I conclude, that the god-making God is of transcendent righteousness&mdash;one who will neither rashly, improperly, nor needlessly bestow a reward so great. I would have you then consider whether the merits of your deities are of a kind to have raised them to the heavens, and not rather to have sunk them down into lowest depths of Tartarus,&mdash; the place which you regard, with many, as the prison-house of infernal punishments. For into this dread place are wont to be cast all who offend against filial <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and such as are guilty of incest with sisters, and seducers of wives, and ravishers of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and boy-polluters, and men of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> tempers, and murderers, and thieves, and deceivers; all, in short, who tread in the footsteps of your gods, not one of whom you can prove free from crime or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, save by denying that they had ever a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But as you cannot deny that, you have those foul blots also as an added reason for not believing that they were made gods afterwards. For if you rule for the very purpose of punishing such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; if every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> man among you rejects all correspondence, converse, and intimacy with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and base, while, on the other hand, the high God has taken up their mates to a share of His majesty, on what ground is it that you thus condemn those whose fellow-actors you adore? Your goodness is an affront in the heavens. Deify your vilest criminals, if you would please your gods. You <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> them by giving divine honours to their fellows. But to say no more about a way of acting so unworthy, there have been men <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, and pure, and good. Yet how many of these nobler men you have left in the regions of doom! As Socrates, so renowned for his wisdom, <a href="../cathen/01712d.htm">Aristides</a> for his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, Themistocles for his warlike genius, Alexander for his sublimity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, Polycrates for his good fortune, Cr&oelig;sus for his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, Demosthenes for his eloquence. Which of these gods of yours is more remarkable for gravity and wisdom than Cato, more just and warlike than Scipio? Which of them more magnanimous than Pompey, more prosperous than Sylla, of greater <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> than Crassus, more eloquent than Tullius? How much better it would have been for the God Supreme to have waited that He might have taken such men as these to be His heavenly associates, prescient as He must have surely been of their worthier character! He was in a hurry, I suppose, and straightway shut heaven's gates; and now He must surely feel ashamed at these worthies murmuring over their lot in the regions below.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>But I pass from these remarks, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and I am going to show what your gods are not, by showing what they are. In reference, then, to these, I see only names of dead men of ancient times; I hear fabulous stories; I recognize sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> founded on mere myths. As to the actual images, I regard them as simply pieces of matter akin to the vessels and utensils in common use among us, or even undergoing in their consecration a hapless change from these useful articles at the hands of reckless art, which in the transforming process treats them with utter contempt, nay, in the very act commits sacrilege; so that it might be no slight solace to us in all our punishments, suffering as we do because of these same gods, that in their making they suffer as we do themselves. You put <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> on crosses and stakes:  what image is not formed from the clay in the first instance, set on cross and stake? The body of your god is first <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on the gibbet. You tear the sides of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with your claws; but in the case of your own gods, axes, and planes, and rasps are put to work more vigorously on every member of the body. We lay our heads upon the block; before the lead, and the glue, and the nails are put in requisition, your deities are headless. We are cast to the wild beasts, while you attach them to Bacchus, and Cybele, and C&aelig;lestis. We are burned in the flames; so, too, are they in their original lump. We are condemned to the mines; from these your gods originate. We are banished to islands; in islands it is a common thing for your gods to have their birth or die. If it is in this way a deity is made, it will follow that as many as are punished are deified, and tortures will have to be declared divinities. But plain it is these objects of your worship have no sense of the injuries and disgraces of their consecrating, as they are equally unconscious of the honours paid to them. O impious words! O <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> reproaches! Gnash your teeth upon us&mdash; foam with maddened rage against us&mdash; you are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, who censured a certain Seneca speaking of your <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> at much greater length and far more sharply! In a word, if we refuse our homage to <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and frigid images, the very counterpart of their dead originals, with which hawks, and mice, and spiders are so well acquainted, does it not merit praise instead of penalty, that we have rejected what we have come to see is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>? We cannot surely be made out to injure those who we are certain are nonentities. What does not exist, is in its nonexistence secure from suffering.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><q>But they are gods to us,</q> you say. And how is it, then, that in utter inconsistency with this, you are convicted of impious, <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>, and irreligious conduct to them, neglecting those you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> to exist, destroying those who are the objects of your <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, making mock of those whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> you avenge? See now if I go beyond the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. First, indeed, seeing you worship, some one god, and some another, of course you give offense to those you do not worship. You cannot continue to give preference to one without slighting another, for selection implies rejection. You despise, therefore, those whom you thus reject; for in your rejection of them, it is plain you have no dread of giving them offense. For, as we have already shown, every god depended on the decision of the senate for his godhead. No god was he whom man in his own counsels did not wish to be so, and thereby condemned. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> deities you call Lares, you exercise a domestic authority over, pledging them, selling them, changing them&mdash; making sometimes a cooking-pot of a Saturn, a firepan of a Minerva, as one or other happens to be worn down, or broken in its long sacred use, or as the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> head feels the pressure of some more sacred home necessity. In like manner, by public law you disgrace your state gods, putting them in the auction-catalogue, and making them a source of revenue. Men seek to get the Capitol, as they seek to get the herb market, under the voice of the crier, under the auction spear, under the registration of the qu&aelig;stor. Deity is struck off and farmed out to the highest bidder. But indeed lands burdened with tribute are of less value; men under the assessment of a poll-tax are less noble; for these things are the marks of servitude. In the case of the gods, on the other hand, the sacredness is great in proportion to the tribute which they yield; nay, the more sacred is a god, the larger is the tax he pays. Majesty is made a source of gain. Religion goes about the taverns begging. You demand a price for the privilege of standing on temple ground, for access to the sacred services; there is no gratuitous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of your divinities permitted&mdash; you must buy their favours with a price. What honours in any way do you render to them that you do not render to the dead? You have temples in the one case just as in the other; you have altars in the one case as in the other. Their <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> have the same dress, the same insignia. As the dead man had his age, his art, his occupation, so it is with the deity. In what respect does the funeral feast differ from the feast of Jupiter? Or the bowl of the gods from the ladle of the manes? Or the undertaker from the soothsayer, as in fact this latter personage also attends upon the dead? With perfect propriety you give divine honours to your departed emperors, as you worship them in life. The gods will count themselves indebted to you; nay, it will be matter of high rejoicing among them that their masters are made their equals. But when you adore Larentina, a public prostitute&mdash; I could have wished that it might at least have been Lais or Phryne&mdash; among your Junos, and Cereses, and Dianas; when you instal in your Pantheon <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>,  giving him a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> and the title of Holy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; when you make an <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> court page a god of the sacred synod, although your ancient deities are in reality no better, they will still think themselves affronted by you, that the privilege antiquity conferred on them alone, has been allowed to others.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>I wish now to review your sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>; and I pass no censure on your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a>, when you offer the worn-out, the scabbed, the corrupting; when you cut off from the fat and the sound the useless parts, such as the head and the hoofs, which in your house you would have assigned to the slaves or the dogs; when of the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of Hercules you do not lay a third upon his altar (I am disposed rather to praise your wisdom in rescuing something from being lost); but turning to your books, from which you get your training in wisdom and the nobler duties of life, what utterly ridiculous things I find!&mdash; that for Trojans and Greeks the gods fought among themselves like pairs of gladiators; that Venus was wounded by a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because she would rescue her son &AElig;neas when he was in peril of his life from the same Diomede; that Mars was almost wasted away by a thirteen months' imprisonment; that Jupiter was saved by a monster's aid from suffering the same <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> at the hands of the other gods; that he now laments the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of Sarpedon, now foully makes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to his own sister, recounting (to her) former mistresses, now for a long time past not so dear as she. After this, what poet is not found copying the example of his chief, to be a disgracer of the gods? One gives Apollo to king Admetus to tend his sheep; another hires out the building labours of Neptune to Laomedon. A well-known lyric poet, too&mdash; Pindar, I mean&mdash; sings of &AElig;sculapius deservedly stricken with lightning for his greed in practising wrongfully his art. A <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deed it was of Jupiter&mdash; if he hurled the bolt&mdash; unnatural to his grandson, and exhibiting <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> feeling to the Physician. Things like these should not be made public if they are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and if false, they should not be fabricated among people professing a great respect for religion. Nor indeed do either tragic or comic writers shrink from setting forth the gods as the origin of all <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> calamities and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. I do not dwell on the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, contenting myself with a reference to Socrates, who, in contempt of the gods, was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of swearing by an oak, and a goat, and a dog. In fact, for this very thing Socrates was condemned to death, that he overthrew the worship of the gods. Plainly, at one time as well as another, that is, always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is disliked. However, when rueing their judgment, the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> inflicted punishment on his accusers, and set up a golden image of him in a temple, the condemnation was in the very act rescinded, and his <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> was restored to its former value. Diogenes, too, makes utter mock of Hercules and the Roman cynic Varro brings forward three hundred Joves, or Jupiters they should be called, all headless.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>Others of your writers, in their wantonness, even minister to your pleasures by vilifying the gods. Examine those charming farces of your Lentuli and Hostilii, whether in the jokes and tricks it is the buffoons or the deities which afford you merriment; such farces I mean as Anubis the Adulterer, and Luna of the masculine gender, and Diana under the lash, and the reading the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Jupiter deceased, and the three famishing Herculeses held up to ridicule. Your dramatic literature, too, depicts all the vileness of your gods. The Sun mourns his offspring  cast down from heaven, and you are full of glee; Cybele sighs after the scornful swain,  and you do not blush; you brook the stage recital of Jupiter's misdeeds, and the shepherd  judging Juno, Venus, and Minerva. Then, again, when the likeness of a god is put on the head of an ignominious and <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> wretch, when one impure and trained up for the art in all effeminacy, represents a Minerva or a Hercules, is not the majesty of your gods insulted, and their deity dishonored? Yet you not merely look on, but applaud. You are, I suppose, more devout in the arena, where after the same fashion your deities dance on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blood, on the pollutions caused by inflicted punishments, as they act their themes and stories, doing their turn for the wretched criminals, except that these, too, often put on divinity and actually play the very gods. We have seen in our day a representation of the mutilation of Attis, that famous god of Pessinus, and a man burnt alive as Hercules. We have made merry amid the ludicrous cruelties of the noonday exhibition, at Mercury examining the bodies of the dead with his hot iron; we have witnessed Jove's brother,  mallet in hand, dragging out the corpses of the gladiators. But who can go into everything of this sort? If by such things as these the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of deity is assailed, if they go to blot out every trace of its majesty, we must explain them by the contempt in which the gods are held, alike by those who actually do them, and by those for whose enjoyment they are done. This it will be said, however, is all in sport. But if I add&mdash; it is what all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and will admit as readily to be the fact&mdash; that in the temples adulteries are arranged, that at the altars pimping is practised, that often in the houses of the temple-keepers and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, under the sacrificial fillets, and the sacred hats,  and the purple robes, amid the fumes of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of licentiousness are done, I am not sure but your gods have more reason to complain of you than of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. It is certainly among the votaries of your religion that the perpetrators of sacrilege are always found, for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do not enter your temples even in the day-time. Perhaps they too would be spoilers of them, if they worshipped in them. What then do they worship, since their objects of worship are different from yours? Already indeed it is implied, as the corollary from their rejection of the lie, that they render homage to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; nor continue longer in an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which they have given up in the very fact of recognizing it to be an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Take this in first of all, and when we have offered a preliminary refutation of some false opinions, go on to derive from it our entire religious system.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p>For, like some others, you are under the delusion that our god is an ass's head.  Cornelius  Tacitus first put this notion into people's minds. In the fifth book of his histories, beginning the (narrative of the) Jewish <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with an account of the origin of the nation; and theorizing at his pleasure about the origin, as well as the name and the religion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he states that having been delivered, or rather, in his opinion, expelled from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in crossing the vast plains of Arabia, where water is so scanty, they were in extremity from thirst; but taking the guidance of the wild asses, which it was thought might be seeking water after feeding, they discovered a fountain, and thereupon in their gratitude they <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> a head of this species of animal. And as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is nearly allied to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, from this, I suppose, it was taken for granted that we too are devoted to the worship of the same image. But the said Cornelius Tacitus (the very opposite of <em>tacit</em> in telling lies) informs us in the work already mentioned, that when Cneius Pompeius captured Jerusalem, he entered the temple to see the arcana of the Jewish religion, but found no image there. Yet surely if worship was rendered to any visible object, the very place for its exhibition would be the shrine; and that all the more that the worship, however unreasonable, had no need there to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> outside beholders. For entrance to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place was permitted to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> alone, while all vision was forbidden to others by an outspread curtain. You will not, however, deny that all beasts of burden, and not parts of them, but the animals entire, are with their goddess Epona objects of worship with you. It is this, perhaps, which displeases you in us, that while your worship here is universal, we do homage only to the ass. Then, if any of you think we render superstitious adoration to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, in that adoration he is sharer with us. If you offer homage to a piece of wood at all, it matters little what it is like when the substance is the same: it is of no consequence the form, if you have the very body of the god. And yet how far does the Athenian Pallas differ from the stock of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, or the Pharian Ceres as she is put up uncarved to sale, a mere rough stake and piece of shapeless wood? Every stake fixed in an upright position is a portion of the cross; we render our adoration, if you will have it so, to a god entire and complete. We have shown before that your deities are derived from shapes modelled from the cross. But you also worship victories, for in your trophies the cross is the heart of the trophy.  The camp religion of the Romans is all through a worship of the standards, a setting the standards above all gods. Well, as those images decking out the standards are ornaments of crosses. All those hangings of your standards and banners are robes of crosses. I praise your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>: you would not consecrate crosses unclothed and unadorned. Others, again, certainly with more information and greater verisimilitude, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the sun is our god. We shall be counted Persians perhaps, though we do not worship the orb of day painted on a piece of linen cloth, having himself everywhere in his own disk. The idea no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> has originated from our being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to turn to the east in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.  But you, many of you, also under pretence sometimes of worshipping the heavenly bodies, move your lips in the direction of the sunrise. In the same way, if we devote Sun-day to rejoicing, from a far different reason than Sun-worship, we have some resemblance to those of you who devote the day of Saturn to ease and luxury, though they too go far away from Jewish ways, of which indeed they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. But lately a new edition of our god has been given to the world in that great city: it originated with a certain vile man who was wont to hire himself out to cheat the wild beasts, and who exhibited a picture with this inscription: The God of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, born of an ass.  He had the ears of an ass, was hoofed in one foot, carried a book,  and wore a toga. Both the name and the figure gave us amusement. But our opponents ought straightway to have done homage to this biformed divinity, for they have acknowledged gods dog-headed and lion-headed, with horn of buck and ram, with goat-like loins, with serpent legs, with wings sprouting from back or foot. These things we have discussed <em>ex abundanti</em>, that we might not seem willingly to pass by any rumor against us unrefuted. Having thoroughly cleared ourselves, we turn now to an exhibition of what our religion really is.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>The object of our worship is the One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  He who by His commanding word, His arranging wisdom, His mighty power, brought forth from nothing this entire mass of our world, with all its array of elements, bodies, spirits, for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His majesty; whence also the Greeks have bestowed on it the name of <span class="greek">&#x039A;&#x1F79;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> . The eye cannot see Him, though He is (spiritually) visible. He is incomprehensible,  though in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He is manifested. He is beyond our utmost thought, though our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> faculties conceive of Him. He is therefore equally real and great. But that which, in the ordinary sense, can be seen and handled and conceived, is inferior to the eyes by which it is taken in, and the hands by which it is tainted, and the faculties by which it is discovered; but that which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only to itself. This it is which gives some notion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while yet beyond all our conceptions&mdash; our very incapacity of fully grasping Him affords us the idea of what He really is. He is presented to our minds in His transcendent greatness, as at once <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and unknown. And this is the crowning guilt of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that they will not recognize One, of whom they cannot possibly be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. Would you have the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from the works of His hands, so numerous and so great, which both contain you and sustain you, which minister at once to your enjoyment, and strike you with awe; or would you rather have it from the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself? Though under the oppressive bondage of the body, though led astray by depraving customs, though enervated by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, though in slavery to false gods; yet, whenever the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> comes to itself, as out of a surfeit, or a sleep, or a sickness, and attains something of its natural soundness, it speaks of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; using no other word, because this is the peculiar name of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is great and good</q>&mdash; <q>Which may God give,</q> are the words on every lip. It bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, too, that God is judge, exclaiming, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees,</q> and, <q>I commend myself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will repay me.</q> O noble testimony of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by nature  <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>! Then, too, in using such words as these, it looks not to the Capitol, but to the heavens. It <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that there is the throne of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as from Him and from thence itself came down.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p>But, that we might attain an ampler and more authoritative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> at once of Himself, and of His counsels and will, God has added a written revelation for the benefit of every one whose heart is set on seeking Him, that seeking he may find, and finding <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and believing <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. For from the first He sent messengers into the world&mdash;men whose stainless righteousness made them worthy to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Most High, and to reveal Him&mdash;men abundantly endowed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that they might proclaim that there is one God only who made all things, who formed man from the dust of the ground (for He is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prometheus who gave order to the world by arranging the seasons and their course)&mdash;these have further set before us the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> He has given of His majesty in His judgments by floods and fires, the rules appointed by Him for securing His favour, as well as the retribution in store for the ignoring, forsaking and keeping them, as being about at the end of all to adjudge His worshippers to everlasting life, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to the doom of fire at once without ending and without break, raising up again all the dead from the beginning, reforming and renewing them with the object of awarding either recompense. Once these things were with us, too, the theme of ridicule. We are of your stock and nature: men are made, not born, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The preachers of whom we have spoken are called <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, from the office which belongs to them of predicting the future. Their words, as well as the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which they performed, that men might have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in their divine authority, we have still in the literary treasures they have left, and which are open to all. Ptolemy, surnamed Philadelphus, the most learned of his race, a man of vast acquaintance with all literature, emulating, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, the book enthusiasm of Pisistratus, among other remains of the past which either their antiquity or something of peculiar interest made famous, at the suggestion of Demetrius Phalereus, who was renowned above all grammarians of his time, and to whom he had committed the management of these things, applied to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for their writings&mdash; I mean the writings peculiar to them and in their tongue, which they alone possessed, for from themselves, as a people dear to God for their fathers' sake, their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had ever sprung, and to them they had ever spoken. Now in ancient times the people we call <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> bare the name of Hebrews, and so both their writings and their speech were Hebrew. But that the understanding of their books might not be wanting, this also the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> supplied to Ptolemy; for they gave him seventy-two interpreters&mdash; men whom the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Menedemus, the well-known asserter of a Providence, regarded with respect as sharing in his views. The same account is given by Arist&aelig;us. So the king left these works unlocked to all, in the Greek language.  To this day, at the temple of Serapis, the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of Ptolemy are to be seen, with the identical Hebrew originals in them. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, too, read them publicly. Under a tribute-liberty, they are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of going to hear them every <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. Whoever gives ear will find God in them; whoever takes pains to understand, will be compelled to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p>Their high antiquity, first of all, claims authority for these writings. With you, too, it is a kind of religion to demand belief on this very ground. Well, all the substances, all the materials, the origins, classes, contents of your most ancient writings, even most nations and cities illustrious in the records of the past and noted for their antiquity in books of annals&mdash;the very forms of your letters, those revealers and custodiers of events, nay (I think I speak still within the mark), your very gods themselves, your very temples and oracles, and sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, are less ancient than the work of a single <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, in whom you have the <em>thesaurus</em> of the entire Jewish religion, and therefore too of ours. If you happen to have heard of a certain <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, I speak first of him: he is as far back as the Argive Inachus; by nearly four hundred years&mdash; only seven less&mdash; he precedes Danaus, your most ancient name; while he antedates by a millennium the death of Priam. I might affirm, too, that he is five hundred years earlier than Homer, and have supporters of that view. The other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also, though of later date, are, even the most recent of them, as far back as the first of your <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and legislators, and historians. It is not so much the difficulty of the subject, as its vastness, that stands in the way of a statement of the grounds on which these statements rest; the matter is not so arduous as it would be tedious. It would require the anxious study of many books, and the fingers busy reckoning. The histories of the most ancient nations, such as the Egyptians, the Chaldeans, the Ph&oelig;nicians, would need to be ransacked; the men of these various nations who have information to give, would have to be called in as witnesses. Manetho the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, and Berosus the Chaldean, and Hieromus the Ph&oelig;nician king of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>; their successors too, Ptolemy the Mendesian, and Demetrius Phalereus, and King Juba, and Apion, and Thallus, and their critic the Jew <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, the native vindicator of the ancient history of his people, who either authenticates or refutes the others. Also the Greek censors' lists must be compared, and the dates of events ascertained, that the chronological connections may be opened up, and thus the reckonings of the various annals be made to give forth light. We must go abroad into the histories and literature of all nations. And, in fact, we have already brought the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> in part before you, in giving those hints as to how it is to be effected. But it seems better to delay the full discussion of this, lest in our haste we do not sufficiently carry it out, or lest in its thorough handling we make too lengthened a digression.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p>To make up for our delay in this, we bring under your notice something of even greater importance; we point to the majesty of our Scriptures, if not to their antiquity. If you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they are as ancient as we say, we offer <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that they are divine. And you may convince yourselves of this at once, and without going very far. Your instructors, the world, and the age, and the event, are all before you. All that is taking place around you was fore-announced; all that you now see with your eye was previously heard by the ear. The swallowing up of cities by the earth; the theft of islands by the sea; <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, bringing external and internal convulsions; the collision of kingdoms with kingdoms; famines and pestilences, and local massacres, and widespread desolating mortalities; the exaltation of the lowly, and the humbling of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>; the decay of righteousness, the growth of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the slackening interest in all good ways; the very seasons and elements going out of their ordinary course, monsters and portents taking the place of nature's forms&mdash; it was all foreseen and predicted before it came to pass. While we suffer the calamities, we read of them in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; as we examine, they are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. Well, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, I think, is the demonstration of its being from above. Hence there is among us an assured <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in regard to coming events as things already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to us, for they were predicted along with what we have day by day fulfilled. They are uttered by the same voices, they are written in the same books&mdash; the same Spirit inspires them. All time is one to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> foretelling the future. Among men, it may be, a distinction of times is made while the fulfilment is going on: from being future we think of it as present, and then from being present we count it as belonging to the past. How are we to blame, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in things to come as though they already were, with the grounds we have for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in these two steps?</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p>But having asserted that our religion is supported by the writings of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the oldest which exist, though it is generally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and we fully admit that it dates from a comparatively recent period&mdash; no further back indeed than the reign of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>&mdash; a question may perhaps be raised on this ground about its standing, as if it were hiding something of its presumption under shadow of an illustrious religion, one which has at any rate undoubted allowance of the law, or because, apart from the question of age, we neither accord with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in their peculiarities in regard to food, nor in their sacred days, nor even in their well-known bodily sign, nor in the possession of a common name, which surely behooved to be the case if we did homage to the same God as they. Then, too, the common people have now some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and think of Him as but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, one indeed such as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> condemned, so that some may naturally enough have taken up the idea that we are worshippers of a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being. But we are neither ashamed of Christ&mdash; for we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to be counted His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and in His name to suffer&mdash; nor do we differ from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> concerning God. We must make, therefore, a remark or two as to Christ's divinity. In former times the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> enjoyed much of God's favour, when the fathers of their race were noted for their righteousness and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. So it was that as a people they flourished greatly, and their kingdom attained to a lofty eminence; and so highly blessed were they, that for their instruction God spoke to them in special revelations, pointing out to them beforehand how they should merit His favor and avoid His displeasure. But how deeply they have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, puffed up to their fall with a false trust in their noble ancestors, turning from God's way into a way of sheer impiety, though they themselves should refuse to admit it, their present national ruin would afford sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. Scattered abroad, a race of wanderers, exiles from their own land and clime, they roam over the whole world without either a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> or a heavenly king, not possessing even the stranger's right to set so much as a simple footstep in their native country. The sacred writers withal, in giving previous warning of these things, all with equal clearness ever declared that, in the last days of the world, God would, out of every nation, and people, and country, choose for Himself more faithful worshippers, upon whom He would bestow His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and that indeed in ampler measure, in keeping with the enlarged capacities of a nobler dispensation. Accordingly, He appeared among us, whose coming to renovate and illuminate man's nature was pre-announced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash; I mean Christ, that <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And so the supreme Head and Master of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and discipline, the Enlightener and Trainer of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, God's own Son, was announced among us, born&mdash; but not so born as to make Him ashamed of the name of Son or of His paternal origin. It was not His lot to have as His father, by incest with a sister, or by violation of a daughter or another's wife, a god in the shape of serpent, or ox, or bird, or lover, for his vile ends transmuting himself into the gold of Danaus. They are your divinities upon whom these base <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of Jupiter were done. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has no mother in any sense which involves impurity; she, whom men suppose to be His mother in the ordinary way, had never entered into the marriage bond.  But, first, I shall discuss His essential nature, and so the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His birth will be understood. We have already asserted that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the world, and all which it contains, by His Word, and Reason, and Power. It is abundantly plain that your <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, too, regard the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>&mdash; that is, the Word and Reason&mdash; as the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. For Zeno lays it down that he is the creator, having made all things according to a determinate plan; that his name is Fate, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Jupiter, and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of all things. Cleanthes ascribes all this to spirit, which he maintains pervades the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. And we, in like manner, hold that the Word, and Reason, and Power, by which we have said God made all, have spirit as their proper and essential <em>substratum</em>, in which the Word has in being to give forth utterances, and reason abides to dispose and arrange, and power is over all to execute. We have been taught that He proceeds forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in that procession He is generated; so that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and is called God from unity of substance with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, too, is a Spirit. Even when the ray is shot from the sun, it is still part of the parent mass; the sun will still be in the ray, because it is a ray of the sun&mdash; there is no division of substance, but merely an extension. Thus Christ is Spirit of Spirit, and God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as light of light is kindled.  The material matrix remains entire and unimpaired, though you derive from it any number of shoots possessed of its qualities; so, too, that which has come forth out of God is at once God and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and the two are one. In this way also, as He is Spirit of Spirit and God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is made a second in manner of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>&mdash; in position, not in nature; and He did not withdraw from the original source, but went forth. This ray of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, as it was always foretold in ancient times, descending into a certain virgin, and made flesh in her womb, is in His birth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> united. The flesh formed by the Spirit is nourished, grows up to manhood, speaks, teaches, works, and is the Christ. Receive meanwhile this fable, if you choose to call it so&mdash; it is like some of your own&mdash; while we go on to show how Christ's claims are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and who the parties are with you by whom such fables have been set a going to overthrow the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which they resemble. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, too, were well aware that Christ was coming, as those to whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> spoke. Nay, even now His advent is expected by them; nor is there any other contention between them and us, than that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the advent has not yet occurred. For two comings of Christ having been revealed to us: a first, which has been fulfilled in the lowliness of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> lot; a second, which impends over the world, now near its close, in all the majesty of Deity unveiled; and, by misunderstanding the first, they have concluded that the second&mdash; which, as matter of more manifest prediction, they set their hopes on&mdash; is the only one. It was the merited punishment of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not to understand the Lord's first advent: for if they had, they would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; and if they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, they would have obtained <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. They themselves read how it is written of them that they are deprived of wisdom and understanding&mdash; of the use of eyes and ears. <span class="stiki" id="note030106"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;6:10</a></span> As, then, under the force of their pre-judgment, they had convinced themselves from His lowly guise that Christ was no more than man, it followed from that, as a necessary consequence, that they should hold Him a magician from the powers which He displayed&mdash;expelling devils from men by a word, restoring vision to the blind, cleansing the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprous</a>, reinvigorating the paralytic, summoning the dead to life again, making the very elements of nature <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him, stilling the storms and walking on the sea; proving that He was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that primordial first-begotten Word, accompanied by power and reason, and based on Spirit,&mdash; that He who was now doing all things by His word, and He who had done that of old, were one and the same. But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were so exasperated by His teaching, by which their rulers and chiefs were convicted of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, chiefly because so many turned aside to Him, that at last they brought Him before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, at that time Roman governor of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>; and, by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of their outcries against Him, extorted a sentence giving Him up to them to be crucified. He Himself had predicted this; which, however, would have signified little had not the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of old done it as well. And yet, nailed upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, He exhibited many notable signs, by which His death was distinguished from all others. At His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, He with a word dismissed from Him His spirit, anticipating the executioner's work. In the same hour, too, the light of day was withdrawn, when the sun at the very time was in his meridian blaze. Those who were not aware that this had been predicted about Christ, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> thought it an eclipse. You yourselves have the account of the world-portent still in your archives.  Then, when His body was taken down from the cross and placed in a sepulchre, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in their eager watchfulness surrounded it with a large military guard, lest, as He had predicted His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the dead on the third day, His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> might remove by stealth His body, and deceive even the incredulous. But, lo, on the third day there a was a sudden shock of earthquake, and the stone which sealed the sepulchre was rolled away, and the guard fled off in terror: without a single <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> near, the grave was found empty of all but the clothes of the buried One. But nevertheless, the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whom it nearly concerned both to spread abroad a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, and keep back a people tributary and submissive to them from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, gave it out that the body of Christ had been stolen by His followers. For the Lord, you see, did not go forth into the public gaze, lest the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> should be delivered from their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also, destined to a great reward, might hold its ground in difficulty. But He spent forty days with some of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> down in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, a region of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, instructing them in the doctrines they were to teach to others. Thereafter, having given them commission to preach the gospel through the world, He was encompassed with a cloud and taken up to heaven,&mdash; a fact more certain far than the assertions of your Proculi concerning Romulus.  All these things <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> did to Christ; and now in fact a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in his own convictions, he sent word of Him to the reigning C&aelig;sar, who was at the time <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>. Yes, and the C&aelig;sars too would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Christ, if either the C&aelig;sars had not been necessary for the world, or if <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> could have been C&aelig;sars. His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also, spreading over the world, did as their Divine Master bade them; and after suffering greatly themselves from the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and with no unwilling heart, as having <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> undoubting in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, at last by <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> cruel sword sowed the seed of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> blood at Rome.  Yes, and we shall prove that even your own gods are effective witnesses for Christ. It is a great matter if, to give you <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, I can bring forward the authority of the very beings on account of whom you refuse them credit. Thus far we have carried out the plan we laid down. We have set forth this origin of our <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> and name, with this account of the Founder of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Let no one henceforth charge us with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; let no one think that it is otherwise than we have represented, for none may give a false account of his religion. For in the very fact that he says he worships another god than he really does, he is guilty of denying the object of his worship, and transferring his worship and homage to another; and, in the transference, he ceases to worship the god he has repudiated. We say, and before all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> we say, and torn and bleeding under your tortures, we cry out, <q>We worship God through Christ.</q> Count Christ a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if you please; by Him and in Him God would be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and be adored. If the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> object, we answer that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who was but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, taught them their religion; against the Greeks we urge that Orpheus at Pieria, Mus&aelig;us at Athens, Melampus at Argos, Trophonius in B&oelig;otia, imposed religious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>; turning to yourselves, who exercise sway over the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, it was the man Numa Pompilius who laid on the Romans a heavy load of costly <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>. Surely Christ, then, had a right to reveal Deity, which was in fact His own essential possession, not with the object of bringing boors and savages by the dread of multitudinous gods, whose favour must be won into some civilization, as was the case with Numa; but as one who aimed to enlighten men already civilized, and under illusions from their very culture, that they might come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Search, then, and see if that divinity of Christ be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. If it be of such a nature that the acceptance of it transforms a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and makes him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good, there is implied in that the duty of renouncing what is opposed to it as false; especially and on every ground that which, hiding itself under the names and images of dead, the labours to convince men of its divinity by certain signs, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and oracles.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p>And we affirm indeed the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of certain spiritual essences; nor is their name unfamiliar. The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> acknowledge there are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; Socrates himself waiting on a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon's</a> will. Why not? Since it is said an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit attached itself specially to him even from his childhood&mdash; turning his mind no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> from what was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. The poets are all acquainted with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> too; even the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> common people make frequent use of them in cursing. In fact, they call upon <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, the demon-chief, in their execrations, as though from some instinctive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of him. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> also admits the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The dealers in magic, no less, come forward as witnesses to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of both kinds of spirits. We are instructed, moreover, by our sacred books how from certain <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who fell of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, there sprang a more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> demon-brood, condemned of God along with the authors of their race, and that chief we have referred to. It will for the present be enough, however, that some account is given of their work. Their great business is the ruin of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. So, from the very first, spiritual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> sought our destruction. They inflict, accordingly, upon our bodies diseases and other grievous calamities, while by violent assaults they hurry the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into sudden and extraordinary excesses. Their marvellous subtleness and tenuity give them access to both parts of our nature. As spiritual, they can do no harm; for, invisible and intangible, we are not cognizant of their action save by its effects, as when some inexplicable, unseen poison in the breeze blights the apples and the grain while in the flower, or kills them in the bud, or destroys them when they have reached maturity; as though by the tainted atmosphere in some unknown way spreading abroad its pestilential exhalations. So, too, by an influence equally obscure, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> breathe into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and rouse up its corruptions with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and vile excesses; or with cruel <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> accompanied by various <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, of which the worst is that by which these deities are commended to the favour of deceived and deluded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, that they may get their proper food of flesh-fumes and blood when that is offered up to idol-images. What is daintier food to the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, than turning men's minds away from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God by the illusions of a false <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>? And here I explain how these illusions are managed. Every spirit is possessed of wings. This is a common property of both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. So they are everywhere in a single moment; the whole world is as one place to them; all that is done over the whole extent of it, it is as easy for them to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as to report. Their swiftness of motion is taken for divinity, because their nature is unknown. Thus they would have themselves thought sometimes the authors of the things which they announce; and sometimes, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the bad things are their doing, never the good. The purposes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, too, they took up of old from the lips of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, even as they spoke them; and they gather them still from their works, when they hear them read aloud. Thus getting, too, from this source some intimations of the future, they set themselves up as rivals of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while they steal His divinations. But the skill with which their responses are shaped to meet events, your Cr&oelig;si and Pyrrhi <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> too well. On the other hand, it was in that way we have explained, the Pythian was able to declare that they were cooking a tortoise  with the flesh of a lamb; in a moment he had been to Lydia. From dwelling in the air, and their nearness to the stars, and their commerce with the clouds, they have means of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the preparatory processes going on in these upper regions, and thus can give promise of the rains which they already feel. Very kind too, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, they are in regard to the healing of diseases. For, first of all, they make you ill; then, to get a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> out of it, they command the application of remedies either altogether new, or contrary to those in use, and straightway withdrawing hurtful influence, they are supposed to have wrought a cure. What need, then, to speak of their other artifices, or yet further of the deceptive power which they have as spirits: of these Castor apparitions,  of water carried by a sieve, and a ship drawn along by a girdle, and a beard reddened by a touch, all done with the one object of showing that men should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the deity of stones, and not seek after the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God?</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p>Moreover, if sorcerers call forth ghosts, and even make what seem the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead to appear; if they put boys to death, in order to get a response from the oracle; if, with their juggling illusions, they make a pretence of doing various <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; if they put dreams into people's minds by the power of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> whose aid they have invited, by whose influence, too, goats and tables are made to divine,&mdash; how much more likely is this power of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in doing with all its might, of its own inclination, and for its own objects, what it does to serve the ends of others! Or if both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> do just what your gods do, where in that case is the pre-eminence of deity, which we must surely think to be above all in might? Will it not then be more reasonable to hold that these spirits make themselves gods, giving as they do the very <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> which raise your gods to godhead, than that the gods are the equals of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? You make a distinction of places, I suppose, regarding as gods in their temple those whose divinity you do not recognize elsewhere; counting the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> which leads one man to leap from the sacred houses, to be something different from that which leads another to leap from an adjoining house; looking on one who cuts his arms and secret parts as under a different furor from another who cuts his throat. The result of the frenzy is the same, and the manner of instigation is one. But thus far we have been dealing only in words: we now proceed to a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of facts, in which we shall show that under different names you have real identity. Let a person be brought before your tribunals, who is plainly under <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demoniacal</a> possession. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit, bidden to speak by a follower of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,  will as readily make the truthful confession that he is a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, as elsewhere he has <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> asserted that he is a god. Or, if you will, let there be produced one of the god-possessed, as they are supposed, who, inhaling at the altar, conceive divinity from the fumes, who are delivered of it by retching, who vent it forth in agonies of gasping. Let that same Virgin C&aelig;lestis herself the rain-promiser, let &AElig;sculapius discoverer of medicines, ready to prolong the life of Socordius, and Tenatius, and Asclepiodotus, now in the last extremity, if they would not confess, in their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of lying to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, that they were <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, then and there shed the blood of that most impudent follower of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. What clearer than a work like that? What more trustworthy than such a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>? The simplicity of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is thus set forth; its own worth sustains it; no ground remains for the least suspicion. Do you say that it is done by magic, or some trick of that sort? You will not say anything of the sort, if you have been allowed the use of your ears and eyes. For what argument can you bring against a thing that is exhibited to the eye in its naked reality? If, on the one hand, they are really gods, why do they pretend to be <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? Is it from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of us? In that case your divinity is put in subjection to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; and you surely can never ascribe deity to that which is under authority of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nay (if it adds anything to the disgrace) of its very enemies. If, on the other hand, they are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, why, inconsistently with this, do they presume to set themselves forth as acting the part of gods? For as beings who put themselves out as gods would never willingly call themselves <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, if they were gods indeed, that they might not thereby in fact abdicate their dignity; so those whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be no more than <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, would not dare to act as gods, if those whose names they take and use were really divine. For they would not dare to treat with disrespect the higher majesty of beings, whose displeasure they would feel was to be dreaded. So this divinity of yours is no divinity; for if it were, it would not be pretended to by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and it would not be denied by gods. But since on both sides there is a concurrent acknowledgment that they are not gods, gather from this that there is but a single race&mdash; I mean the race of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, the real race in both cases. Let your search, then, now be after gods; for those whom you had imagined to be so you find to be spirits of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, as we have thus not only shown from our own gods that neither themselves nor any others have claims to deity, you may see at once who is really <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and whether that is He and He alone whom we <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> own; as also whether you are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, and worship Him, after the manner of our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and discipline. But at once they will say, Who is this Christ with his fables? Is he an ordinary man? Is he a sorcerer? Was his body stolen by his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> from its tomb? Is he now in the realms below? Or is he not rather up in the heavens, thence about to come again, making the whole world shake, filling the earth with dread alarms, making all but <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> wail&mdash; as the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, as the Word, the Reason, the Wisdom, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? Mock as you like, but get the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> if you can to join you in your mocking; let <em>them</em> deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is coming to judge every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from the world's beginning, clothing it again with the body it laid aside at death; let <em>them</em> declare it, say, before your tribunal, that this work has been allotted to Minos and Rhadamanthus, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and the poets agree; let them put away from them at least the mark of ignominy and condemnation. They disclaim being unclean spirits, which yet we must hold as indubitably <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by their relish for the blood and fumes and f&oelig;tid carcasses of sacrificial animals, and even by the vile language of their ministers. Let them deny that, for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> condemned already, they are kept for that very judgment-day, with all their worshippers and their works. Why, all the authority and power we have over them is from our naming the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and recalling to their memory the woes with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> threatens them at the hands of Christ as Judge, and which they expect one day to overtake them. Fearing Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they become subject to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Christ. So at our touch and breathing, overwhelmed by the thought and realization of those judgment fires, they leave at our command the bodies they have entered, unwilling, and distressed, and before your very eyes put to an open shame. You <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them when they lie; give credit to them, then, when they speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about themselves. No one plays the liar to bring disgrace upon his own head, but for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> rather. You give a readier confidence to people making confessions against themselves, than denials in their own behalf. It has not been an unusual thing, accordingly, for those testimonies of your deities to convert men to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; for in giving full belief to them, we are led to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Yes, your very gods kindle up <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in our Scriptures, they build up the confidence of our hope. You do homage, as I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, to them also with the blood of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. On no account, then, would they lose those who are so useful and dutiful to them, anxious even to hold you fast, lest some day or other as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> you might put them to the rout,&mdash; if under the power of a follower of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who desires to prove to you the Truth, it were at all possible for them to lie.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p>This whole confession of these beings, in which they declare that they are not gods, and in which they tell you that there is no God but one, the God whom we adore, is quite sufficient to clear us from the crime of treason, chiefly against the Roman religion. For if it is certain the gods have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, there is no religion in the case. If there is no religion, because there are no gods, we are assuredly not guilty of any offense against religion. Instead of that, the charge recoils on your own head: worshipping a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, you are really guilty of the crime you charge on us, not merely by refusing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by going the further length of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> it. But now, granting that these objects of your worship are really gods, is it not generally held that there is one higher and more potent, as it were the world's chief ruler, endowed with absolute power and majesty? For the common way is to apportion deity, giving an imperial and supreme domination to one, while its offices are put into the hands of many, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> describes great Jupiter in the heavens, surrounded by an array at once of deities and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. It behooves us, therefore, to show equal respect to the procurators, prefects, and governors of the divine empire. And yet how great a crime does he commit, who, with the object of gaining higher favour with the C&aelig;sar, transfers his endeavours and his hopes to another, and does not confess that the appellation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as of Emperor belongs only to the Supreme Head, when it is held a capital offense among us to call, or hear called, by the highest title any other than C&aelig;sar himself! Let one man worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, another Jupiter; let one lift suppliant hands to the heavens, another to the altar of Fides; let one&mdash; if you choose to take this view of it&mdash; count in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the clouds, and another the ceiling panels; let one consecrate his own life to his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and another that of a goat. For see that you do not give a further ground for the charge of irreligion, by taking away religious liberty,  and forbidding free choice of deity, so that I may no longer worship according to my inclination, but am compelled to worship against it. Not even a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being would care to have unwilling homage rendered him; and so the very Egyptians have been permitted the legal use of their ridiculous <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, liberty to make gods of birds and beasts, nay, to condemn to death any one who kills a god of their sort. Every province even, and every city, has its god. <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> has Astarte, Arabia has Dusares, the Norici have Belenus, Africa has its C&aelig;lestis, Mauritania has its own princes. I have spoken, I think, of Roman provinces, and yet I have not said their gods are Roman; for they are not worshipped at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> any more than others who are ranked as deities over <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> itself by municipal consecration, such as Delventinus of Casinum, Visidianus of Narnia, Ancharia of Asculum, Nortia of Volsinii, Valentia of Ocriculum, Hostia of Satrium, Father Curis of Falisci, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of whom, too, Juno got her surname. In, fact, we alone are prevented having a religion of our own. We give offense to the Romans, we are excluded from the rights and privileges of Romans, because we do not worship the gods of Rome. It is well that there is a God of all, whose we all are, whether we will or no. But with you liberty is given to worship any god but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as though He were not rather the God all should worship, to whom all belong.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p>I think I have offered sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> upon the question of false and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> divinity, having shown that the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> rests not merely on debate and argument, but on the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the very beings whom you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> are gods, so that the point needs no further handling. However, having been led thus naturally to speak of the Romans, I shall not avoid the controversy which is invited by the groundless assertion of those who maintain that, as a reward of their singular homage to religion, the Romans have been raised to such heights of power as to have become masters of the world; and that so certainly divine are the beings they worship, that those prosper beyond all others, who beyond all others <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> them.  This, forsooth, is the wages the gods have paid the Romans for their devotion. The progress of the empire is to be ascribed to Sterculus, the Mutunus, and Larentina! For I can hardly think that foreign gods would have been disposed to show more favour to an alien race than to their own, and given their own fatherland, in which they had their birth, grew up to manhood, became illustrious, and at last were buried, over to invaders from another shore! As for Cybele, if she set her affections on the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as sprung of the Trojan stock saved from the arms of Greece, she herself forsooth being of the same race&mdash;if she foresaw her transference  to the avenging people by whom Greece the conqueror of Phrygia was to be subdued, let her look to it (in regard of her native country's conquest by Greece). Why, too, even in these days the <em>Mater Magna</em> has given a notable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of her greatness which she has conferred as a boon upon the city; when, after the loss to the State of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> at Sirmium, on the sixteenth before the Kalends of April, that most sacred <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of hers was offering, a week after, impure libations of blood drawn from his own arms, and issuing his commands that the ordinary <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> should be made for the safety of the emperor already dead. O tardy messengers! O sleepy dispatches! Through whose fault Cybele had not an earlier <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the imperial decease, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> might have no occasion to ridicule a goddess so unworthy. Jupiter, again, would surely never have permitted his own Crete to fall at once before the Roman Fasces, forgetful of that Idean cave and the Corybantian cymbals, and the sweet odour of her who nursed him there. Would he not have exalted his own tomb above the entire Capitol, that the land which covered the ashes of Jove might rather be the mistress of the world? Would Juno have desired the destruction of the Punic city, beloved even to the neglect of Samos, and that by a nation of &AElig;nead&aelig;? As to that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, <q>Here were her arms, here was her chariot, this kingdom, if the Fates permit, the goddess tends and cherishes to be mistress of the nations.</q>  Jove's hapless wife and sister had no power to prevail against the Fates! <q>Jupiter himself is sustained by <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>.</q> And yet the Romans have never done such homage to the Fates, which gave them <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> against the purpose and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Juno, as to the abandoned harlot Larentina. It is undoubted that not a few of your gods have reigned on earth as kings. If, then, they now possess the power of bestowing empire, when they were kings themselves, from whence had they received their kingly honours? Whom did Jupiter and Saturn worship? A Sterculus, I suppose. But did the Romans, along with the native-born inhabitants, afterwards adore also some who were never kings? In that case, however, they were under the reign of others, who did not yet bow down to them, as not yet raised to godhead. It belongs to others, then, to make gift of kingdoms, since there were kings before these gods had their names on the roll of divinities. But how utterly foolish it is to attribute the greatness of the Roman name to religious merits, since it was after Rome became an empire, or call it still a kingdom, that the religion she professes made its chief progress! Is it the case now? Has its religion been the source of the prosperity of Rome? Though Numa set agoing an eagerness after superstitious observances, yet religion among the Romans was not yet a matter of images or temples. It was frugal in its ways, its <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> were simple, and there were no capitols struggling to the heavens; but the altars were offhand ones of turf, and the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> were yet of Samian earthen-ware, and from these the odours rose, and no likeness of God was to be seen. For at that time the skill of the Greeks and Tuscans in image-making had not yet overrun the city with the products of their art. The Romans, therefore, were not distinguished for their devotion to the gods before they attained to greatness; and so their greatness was not the result of their religion. Indeed, how could religion make a people great who have owed their greatness to their irreligion? For, if I am not mistaken, kingdoms and empires are acquired by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and are extended by victories. More than that, you cannot have <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and victories without the taking, and often the destruction, of cities. That is a thing in which the gods have their share of calamity. Houses and temples suffer alike; there is indiscriminate slaughter of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and citizens; the hand of rapine is laid equally upon sacred and on common treasure. Thus the sacrileges of the Romans are as numerous as their trophies. They boast as many triumphs over the gods as over the nations; as many spoils of battle they have still, as there remain images of captive deities. And the poor gods submit to be adored by their enemies, and they ordain illimitable empire to those whose injuries rather than their simulated homage should have had retribution at their hands. But divinities unconscious are with impunity dishonoured, just as in vain they are adored. You certainly never can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that devotion to religion has evidently advanced to greatness a people who, as we have put it, have either grown by injuring religion, or have injured religion by their growth. Those, too, whose kingdoms have become part of the one great whole of the Roman empire, were not without religion when their kingdoms were taken from them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p>Examine then, and see if <em>He</em> be not the dispenser of kingdoms, who is Lord at once of the world which is ruled, and of man himself who rules; if He have not ordained the changes of dynasties, with their appointed seasons, who was before all time, and made the world a body of times; if the rise and the fall of states are not the work of Him, under whose sovereignty the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> once <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> without states at all. How do you allow yourselves to fall into such <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>? Why, the Rome of rural simplicity is older than some of her gods; she reigned before her <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, vast Capitol was built. The <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a> exercised dominion, too, before the days of the Pontiffs; and the Medes before the Quindecemvirs; and the Egyptians before the Salii; and the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> before the Luperci; and the Amazons before the Vestal Virgins. And to add another point: if the <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a> of Rome give empire, ancient <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> would never have been a kingdom, despising as it did one and all these idol deities; <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, whose God you Romans once honoured with victims, and its temple with gifts, and its people with treaties; and which would never have been beneath your sceptre but for that last and crowning offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in rejecting and crucifying Christ.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

<p>Enough has been said in these remarks to confute the charge of treason against your religion:  for we cannot be held to do harm to that which has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. When we are called therefore to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, we resolutely refuse, relying on the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> we possess, by which we are well assured of the real objects to whom these services are offered, under profaning of images and the deification of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> names. Some, indeed, think it a piece of insanity that, when it is in our power to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> at once, and go away unharmed, holding as ever our convictions, we prefer an obstinate persistence in our confession to our safety. You advise us, forsooth, to take <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> advantage of you; but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence such suggestions come, who is at the bottom of it all, and how every effort is made, now by cunning suasion, and now by merciless <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, to overthrow our constancy. No other than that spirit, half <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and half <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who, hating us because of his own separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and stirred with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> for the favour God has shown us, turns your minds against us by an occult influence, moulding and instigating them to all that perversity in judgment, and that unrighteous cruelty, which we have mentioned at the beginning of our work, when entering on this discussion. For, though the whole power of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and kindred spirits is subject to us, yet still, as ill-disposed slaves sometimes conjoin contumacy with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and delight to injure those of whom they at the same time stand in awe, so is it here. For <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> also inspires <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Besides, in their desperate condition, as already under condemnation, it gives them some comfort, while punishment delays, to have the usufruct of their malignant dispositions. And yet, when hands are laid on them, they are subdued at once, and submit to their lot; and those whom at a distance they oppose, in close quarters they supplicate for mercy. So when, like insurrectionary workhouses, or prisons, or mines, or any such penal slaveries, they break forth against us their masters, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the while that they are not a match for us, and just on that account, indeed, rush the more recklessly to destruction. We resist them, unwillingly, as though they were equals, and contend against them by persevering in that which they assail; and our triumph over them is never more complete than when we are condemned for resolute adherence to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<p>But as it was easily seen to be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to compel freemen against their will to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> (for even in other acts of religious service a willing mind is required), it should be counted quite absurd for one man to compel another to do <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the gods, when he ought ever voluntarily, and in the sense of his own need, to seek their favour, lest in the liberty which is his right he should be ready to say, <q>I want none of Jupiter's favours; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> who are you? Let Janus meet me with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> looks, with whichever of his faces he likes; what have you to do with me?</q> You have been led, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, by these same <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> to compel us to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for the well-being of the emperor; and you are under a necessity of using force, just as we are under an obligation to face the dangers of it. This brings us, then, to the second ground of accusation, that we are guilty of treason against a majesty more august; for you do homage with a greater dread and an intenser reverence to C&aelig;sar, than Olympian Jove himself. And if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it, upon sufficient grounds. For is not any living man better than a dead one, whoever he be? But this is not done by you on any other ground than regard to a power whose presence you vividly realize; so that also in this you are convicted of impiety to your gods, inasmuch as you show a greater reverence to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sovereignty than you do to them. Then, too, among you, people far more readily <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> a false <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in the name of all the gods, than in the name of the single genius of C&aelig;sar.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>

<p>Let it be made clear, then, first of all, if those to whom <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is offered are really able to protect either emperor or anybody else, and so adjudge us guilty of treason, if <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, spirits of most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> nature, do any good, if the lost save, if the condemned give liberty, if the dead (I refer to what you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well enough) defend the living. For surely the first thing they would look to would be the protection of their <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, and images, and temples, which rather owe their safety, I think, to the watch kept by C&aelig;sar's guards. Nay, I think the very materials of which these are made come from C&aelig;sar's mines, and there is not a temple but depends on C&aelig;sar's will. Yes, and many gods have felt the displeasure of the C&aelig;sar. It makes for my argument if they are also partakers of his favour, when he bestows on them some gift or privilege. How shall they who are thus in C&aelig;sar's power, who belong entirely to him, have C&aelig;sar's protection in their hands, so that you can <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> them able to give to C&aelig;sar what they more readily get from him? This, then, is the ground on which we are charged with treason against the imperial majesty, to wit, that we do not put the emperors under their own possessions; that we do not offer a mere mock service on their behalf, as not believing their safety rests in leaden hands. But you are impious in a high degree who look for it where it is not, who seek it from those who have it not to give, passing by Him who has it entirely in His power. Besides this, you <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> where to seek for it, and who, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> where to seek for it, are able as well to secure it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>

<p>For we offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the safety of our princes to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose favour, beyond all others, they must themselves desire. They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from whom they have obtained their power; they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, as they are men, from whom they have received life itself; they are convinced that He is God alone, on whose power alone they are entirely dependent, to whom they are second, after whom they occupy the highest places, before and above all the gods. Why not, since they are above all living men, and the living, as living, are superior to the dead? They reflect upon the extent of their power, and so they come to understand the highest; they acknowledge that they have all their might from Him against whom their might is nought. Let the emperor make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on heaven; let him lead heaven captive in his triumph; let him put guards on heaven; let him impose taxes on heaven! He cannot. Just because he is less than heaven, he is great. For he himself is His to whom heaven and every creature appertains. He gets his sceptre where he first got his humanity; his power where he got the breath of life. Thither we lift our eyes, with hands outstretched, because free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; with head uncovered, for we have nothing whereof to be ashamed; finally, without a monitor, because it is from the heart we supplicate. Without ceasing, for all our emperors we offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for life prolonged; for security to the empire; for protection to the imperial house; for brave armies, a faithful senate, a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> people, the world at rest, whatever, as man or C&aelig;sar, an emperor would wish. These things I cannot ask from any but the God from whom I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I shall obtain them, both because He alone bestows them and because I have claims upon Him for their gift, as being a servant of His, rendering homage to Him alone, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for His doctrine, offering to Him, at His own requirement, that costly and noble <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>  dispatched from the chaste body, an unstained <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, a sanctified spirit, not the few grains of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> a farthing buys &mdash; tears of an <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> tree&mdash;not a few drops of wine,&mdash; not the blood of some worthless ox to which death is a relief, and, in addition to other offensive things, a polluted <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, so that one wonders, when your victims are examined by these vile <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, why the examination is not rather of the sacrificers than the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. With our hands thus stretched out and up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, rend us with your iron claws, hang us up on crosses, wrap us in flames, take our heads from us with the sword, let loose the wild beasts on us&mdash;the very attitude of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> is one of preparation for all punishment.  Let this, good rulers, be your work: wring from us the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, beseeching God on the emperor's behalf. Upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and devotion to His name, put the brand of crime.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>

<p>But we merely, you say, flatter the emperor, and feign these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of ours to escape <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Thank you for your mistake, for you give us the opportunity of proving our allegations. Do you, then, who think that we care nothing for the welfare of C&aelig;sar, look into God's revelations, examine our sacred books, which we do not keep in hiding, and which many accidents put into the hands of those who are not of us. Learn from them that a large benevolence is enjoined upon us, even so far as to supplicate God for our enemies, and to beseech blessings on our persecutors. <span class="stiki" id="note030120"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44</a></span> Who, then, are greater enemies and persecutors of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, than the very parties with treason against whom we are charged? Nay, even in terms, and most clearly, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>Pray for kings, and rulers, and powers, that all may be peace with you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030121"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:2</a></span> For when there is disturbance in the empire, if the commotion is felt by its other members, surely we too, though we are not thought to be given to disorder, are to be found in some place or other which the calamity affects.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>

<p>There is also another and a greater necessity for our offering <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in behalf of the emperors, nay, for the complete stability of the empire, and for Roman interests in general. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that a mighty shock impending  over the whole earth&mdash; in fact, the very end of all things threatening dreadful woes&mdash; is only retarded by the continued <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the Roman empire.  We have no desire, then, to be overtaken by these dire events; and in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that their coming may be delayed, we are lending our aid to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome's</a> duration. More than this, though we decline to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the genii of the C&aelig;sars, we <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by their safety, which is worth far more than all your genii. Are you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that these genii are called <q>D&aelig;mones,</q> and thence the diminutive name <q>D&aelig;monia</q> is applied to them? We respect in the emperors the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has set them over the nations. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is that in them which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has willed; and to what God has willed we desire all safety, and we count an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by it a great <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. But as for <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, that is, your genii, we have been in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of exorcising them, not of swearing by them, and thereby conferring on them divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33</h2>

<p>But why dwell longer on the reverence and sacred respect of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to the emperor, whom we cannot but look up to as called by our Lord to his office? So that on valid grounds I might say C&aelig;sar is more ours than yours, for our God has appointed him. Therefore, as having this propriety in him, I do more than you for his welfare, not merely because I ask it of Him who can give it, or because I ask it as one who deserves to get it, but also because, in keeping the majesty of C&aelig;sar within due limits, and putting it under the Most High, and making it less than divine, I commend him the more to the favour of Deity, to whom I make him alone inferior. But I place him in subjection to one I regard as more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than himself. Never will I call the emperor <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that either because it is not in me to be guilty of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>; or that I dare not turn him into ridicule; or that not even himself will desire to have that high name applied to him. If he is but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it is his interest as man to give God His higher place. Let him think it enough to bear the name of emperor. That, too, is a great name of God's giving. To call him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> him of his title. If he is not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, emperor he cannot be. Even when, amid the honours of a triumph, he sits on that lofty chariot, he is reminded that he is only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. A voice at his back keeps whispering in his ear, <q>Look behind you; remember you are but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> And it only adds to his exultation, that he shines with a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> so surpassing as to require an admonitory reference to his condition.  It adds to his greatness that he needs such a reminiscence, lest he should think himself divine.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>

<p>Augustus, the founder of the empire, would not even have the title Lord; for that, too, is a name of Deity. For my part, I am willing to give the emperor this designation, but in the common acceptation of the word, and when I am not forced to call him Lord as in God's place. But my relation to him is one of freedom; for I have but one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lord, the God <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, who is Lord of the emperor as well. How can he, who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> father of his country, be its lord? The name of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is more grateful than the name of power; so the heads of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> are called fathers rather than lords. Far less should the emperor have the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We can only profess our belief that he is that by the most unworthy, nay, a fatal flattery; it is just as if, having an emperor, you call another by the name, in which case will you not give great and unappeasable offense to him who actually reigns?&mdash; an offense he, too, needs to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> on whom you have bestowed the title. Give all reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if you wish Him to be propitious to the emperor. Give up all worship of, and belief in, any other being as divine. Cease also to give the sacred name to him who has need of God himself. If such adulation is not ashamed of its lie, in addressing a man as divine, let it have some dread at least of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> omen which it bears. It is the invocation of a curse, to give C&aelig;sar the name of god before his apotheosis.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35</h2>

<p>This is the reason, then, why <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are counted public enemies: that they pay no vain, nor false, nor foolish honours to the emperor; that, as men believing in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, they prefer to celebrate their festal days with a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, instead of with the common wantonness. It is, forsooth, a notable homage to bring fires and couches out before the public, to have feasting from street to street, to turn the city into one great tavern, to make mud with wine, to run in troops to acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of shamelessness to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> allurements! What! Is public <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> manifested by public disgrace? Do things unseemly at other times beseem the festal days of princes? Do they who observe the rules of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> out of reverence for C&aelig;sar, for his sake turn aside from them? Shall <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> be a license to immoral <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and shall religion be regarded as affording the occasion for all riotous extravagance? Poor we, worthy of all condemnation! For why do we keep the votive days and high rejoicings in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the C&aelig;sars with <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, sobriety, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>? Why, on the day of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, do we neither cover our door-posts with laurels, nor intrude upon the day with lamps? It is a proper thing, at the call of a public festivity, to dress your house up like some new brothel.  However, in the matter of this homage to a lesser majesty, in reference to which we are accused of a lower sacrilege, because we do not celebrate along with you the holidays of the C&aelig;sars in a manner forbidden alike by modesty, decency, and purity&mdash;in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they have been established rather as affording opportunities for licentiousness than from any worthy motive&mdash;in this matter I am anxious to point out how faithful and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <em>you</em> are, lest perchance here also those who will not have us counted Romans, but enemies of Rome's chief rulers, be found themselves worse than we <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>! I appeal to the inhabitants of Rome themselves, to the native population of the seven hills: does that Roman vernacular of theirs ever spare a C&aelig;sar? The Tiber and the wild beasts' schools bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. Say now if nature had covered our hearts with a transparent substance through which the light could pass, whose hearts, all graven over, would not betray the scene of another and another C&aelig;sar presiding at the distribution of a largess? And this at the very time they are shouting, <q>May Jupiter take years from us, and with them lengthen like to you,</q>&mdash; words as foreign to the lips of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> as it is out of keeping with his character to desire a change of emperor. But this is the rabble, you say; yet, as the rabble, they still are Romans, and none more frequently than they demand the death of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.  Of course, then, the other classes, as befits their higher rank, are religiously faithful. No breath of treason is there ever in the senate, in the equestrian order, in the camp, in the palace. Whence, then, came a Cassius, a Niger, an Albinus? Whence they who beset the C&aelig;sar  between the two laurel groves? Whence they who practised wrestling, that they might acquire skill to strangle him? Whence they who in full armour broke into the palace,  more audacious than all your Tigerii and Parthenii.  If I mistake not, they were Romans; that is, they were not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Yet all of them, on the very eve of their traitorous outbreak, offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for the safety of the emperor, and swore by his genius, one thing in profession, and another in the heart; and no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of calling <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> enemies of the state. Yes, and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are now daily brought to light as confederates or approvers of these crimes and treasons, the still remnant gleanings after a vintage of traitors, with what verdant and branching laurels they clad their door-posts, with what lofty and brilliant lamps they smoked their porches, with what most exquisite and gaudy couches they divided the Forum among themselves; not that they might celebrate public rejoicings, but that they might get a foretaste of their own votive seasons in partaking of the festivities of another, and inaugurate the model and image of their hope, changing in their minds the emperor's name. The same homage is paid, dutifully too, by those who consult astrologers, and soothsayers, and augurs, and magicians, about the life of the C&aelig;sars,&mdash; arts which, as made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and forbidden by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do not even make use of in their own affairs. But who has any occasion to inquire about the life of the emperor, if he have not some wish or thought against it, or some hopes and expectations after it? For consultations of this sort have not the same motive in the case of friends as in the case of sovereigns. The anxiety of a kinsman is something very different from that of a subject.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36</h2>

<p>If it is the fact that men bearing the name of Romans are found to be enemies of Rome, why are we, on the ground that we are regarded as enemies, denied the name of Romans? <em>We</em> may be at once Romans and foes of Rome, when men passing for Romans are discovered to be enemies of their country. So the affection, and fealty, and reverence, due to the emperors do not consist in such tokens of homage as these, which even hostility may be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in performing, chiefly as a cloak to its purposes; but in those ways which Deity as certainly enjoins on us, as they are held to be necessary in the case of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as well as emperors. Deeds of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart-goodness are not due by us to emperors alone. We never do good with respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; for in our own interest we conduct ourselves as those who take no payment either of praise or premium from man, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who both requires and remunerates an impartial benevolence.  We are the same to emperors as to our ordinary neighbors. For we are equally forbidden to wish ill, to do ill, to speak ill, to think ill of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The thing we must not do to an emperor, we must not do to any one else: what we would not do to anybody, a <em>fortiori</em>, perhaps we should not do to him whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has been pleased so highly to exalt.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37</h2>

<p>If we are enjoined, then, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our enemies, as I have remarked above, whom have we to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>? If injured, we are forbidden to retaliate, lest we become as bad ourselves: who can suffer injury at our hands? In regard to this, recall your own experiences. How often you inflict gross cruelties on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, partly because it is your own inclination, and partly in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>! How often, too, the hostile mob, paying no regard to you, takes the law into its own hand, and assails us with stones and flames! With the very frenzy of the Bacchanals, they do not even spare the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> dead, but tear them, now sadly changed, no longer entire, from the rest of the tomb, from the asylum we might say of death, cutting them in pieces, rending them asunder. Yet, banded together as we are, ever so ready to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> our lives, what single case of revenge for injury are you able to point to, though, if it were held right among us to repay <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, a single night with a torch or two could achieve an ample vengeance? But away with the idea of a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> divine avenging itself by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fires, or shrinking from the sufferings in which it is tried. If we desired, indeed, to act the part of open enemies, not merely of secret avengers, would there be any lacking in strength, whether of numbers or resources? The Moors, the Marcomanni, the Parthians themselves, or any single people, however great, inhabiting a distinct territory, and confined within its own boundaries, surpasses, forsooth, in numbers, one spread over all the world! We are but of yesterday, and we have filled every place among you&mdash; cities, islands, fortresses, towns, market-places, the very camp, tribes, companies, palace, senate, forum&mdash;we have left nothing to you but the temples of your gods. For what <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> should we not be fit, not eager, even with unequal forces, we who so willingly yield ourselves to the sword, if in our religion it were not counted better to be slain than to slay? Without arms even, and raising no insurrectionary banner, but simply in enmity to you, we could carry on the contest with you by an ill-willed severance alone. For if such multitudes of men were to break away from you, and betake themselves to some remote corner of the world, why, the very loss of so many citizens, whatever sort they were, would cover the empire with shame; nay, in the very forsaking, vengeance would be inflicted. Why, you would be horror-struck at the solitude in which you would find yourselves, at such an all-prevailing silence, and that stupor as of a dead world. You would have to seek subjects to govern. You would have more enemies than citizens remaining. For now it is the immense number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> which makes your enemies so few&mdash;almost all the inhabitants of your various cities being followers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  Yet you choose to call us enemies of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, rather than of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Nay, who would deliver you from those secret foes, ever busy both destroying your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and ruining your health? Who would save you, I mean, from the attacks of those spirits of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which without reward or hire we <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcise</a>? This alone would be revenge enough for us, that you were henceforth left free to the possession of unclean spirits. But instead of taking into account what is due to us for the important protection we afford you, and though we are not merely no trouble to you, but in fact necessary to your well-being, you prefer to hold us enemies, as indeed we are, yet not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but rather of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38</h2>

<p>Ought not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, therefore, to receive not merely a somewhat milder treatment, but to have a place among the law-tolerated societies, seeing they are not chargeable with any such crimes as are commonly dreaded from societies of the illicit class? For, unless I mistake the matter, the prevention of such associations is based on a prudential regard to public order, that the state may not be divided into parties, which would naturally lead to disturbance in the electoral assemblies, the councils, the curi&aelig;, the special conventions, even in the public shows by the hostile collisions of rival parties; especially when now, in pursuit of gain, men have begun to consider their <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> an article to be bought and sold. But as those in whom all ardour in the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is dead, we have no pressing inducement to take part in your public meetings; nor is there anything more entirely foreign to us than affairs of state. We acknowledge  one all-embracing commonwealth&mdash; the world. We renounce all your spectacles, as strongly as we renounce the matters originating them, which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> were conceived of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, when we give up the very things which are the basis of their representations. Among us nothing is ever said, or seen, or heard, which has anything in common with the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of the circus, the immodesty of the theatre, the atrocities of the arena, the useless exercises of the wrestling-ground. Why do you take offense at us because we differ from you in regard to your pleasures? If we will not partake of your enjoyments, the loss is ours, if there be loss in the case, not yours. We reject what pleases you. You, on the other hand, have no taste for what is our delight. The <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> were allowed by you to decide for themselves one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> source of pleasure&mdash; I mean equanimity; the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, on his part, has many such enjoyments&mdash; what harm in that?</p>

<h2>Chapter 39</h2>

<p>I shall at once go on, then, to exhibit the peculiarities of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> society, that, as I have refuted the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> charged against it, I may point out its positive good.  We are a body knit together as such by a common religious profession, by unity of discipline, and by the bond of a common hope. We meet together as an assembly and congregation, that, offering up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to God as with united force, we may wrestle with Him in our supplications. This <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> God delights in. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, too, for the emperors, for their ministers and for all in authority, for the welfare of the world, for the prevalence of peace, for the delay of the final consummation.  We assemble to read our sacred writings, if any peculiarity of the times makes either forewarning or reminiscence needful.  However it be in that respect, with the sacred words we nourish our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we animate our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, we make our confidence more steadfast; and no less by inculcations of God's precepts we confirm good habits. In the same place also exhortations are made, rebukes and sacred censures are administered. For with a great gravity is the work of judging carried on among us, as befits those who feel assured that they are in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and you have the most notable example of judgment to come when any one has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> so grievously as to require his severance from us in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in the congregation and in all sacred intercourse. The tried men of our elders preside over us, obtaining that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> not by purchase, but by established character. There is no buying and selling of any sort in the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Though we have our treasure-chest, it is not made up of purchase-money, as of a religion that has its price. On the monthly day,  if he likes, each puts in a small donation; but only if it be his pleasure, and only if he be able: for there is no compulsion; all is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. These gifts are, as it were, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety's</a> deposit fund. For they are not taken thence and spent on feasts, and drinking-bouts, and eating-houses, but to support and bury poor people, to supply the wants of boys and girls destitute of means and <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and of old <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> confined now to the house; such, too, as have suffered shipwreck; and if there happen to be any in the mines, or banished to the islands, or shut up in the prisons, for nothing but their fidelity to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of God's Church, they become the nurslings of their confession. But it is mainly the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> so noble that lead many to put a brand upon us. <em>See</em>, they say, <em>how they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one</em>  <em>another</em>, for themselves are animated by mutual <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; how they are ready even to die for one another, for they themselves will sooner <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. And they are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with us, too, because we call each other brethren; for no other reason, as I think, than because among themselves names of consanguinity are assumed in mere pretence of affection. But we are your brethren as well, by the law of our common mother nature, though you are hardly men, because brothers so unkind. At the same time, how much more fittingly they are called and counted brothers who have been led to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God as their common Father, who have drunk in one spirit of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, who from the same womb of a common <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> have agonized into the same light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>! But on this very account, perhaps, we are regarded as having less claim to be held <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> brothers, that no tragedy makes a noise about our brotherhood, or that the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> possessions, which generally destroy brotherhood among you, create fraternal bonds among us. One in mind and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, we do not hesitate to share our earthly goods with one another. All things are common among us but our wives. We give up our community where it is practised alone by others, who not only take possession of the wives of their friends, but most tolerantly also accommodate their friends with theirs, following the example, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, of those wise men of ancient times, the Greek Socrates and the Roman Cato, who shared with their friends the wives whom they had married, it seems for the sake of progeny both to themselves and to others; whether in this acting against their partners' wishes, I am not able to say. Why should they have any care over their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, when their husbands so readily bestowed it away? O noble example of Attic wisdom, of Roman gravity&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and the censor playing pimps! What wonder if that great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> towards one another is desecrated by you! For you abuse also our <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> feasts, on the ground that they are extravagant as well as infamously <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. To us, it seems, applies the saying of Diogenes: <q>The people of Megara feast as though they were going to die on the morrow; they build as though they were never to die!</q> But one sees more readily the mote in another's eye than the beam in his own. Why, the very air is soured with the eructations of so many tribes, and <em>curi&aelig;</em>, and <em>decuri&aelig;</em>. The Salii cannot have their feast without going into debt; you must get the accountants to tell you what the tenths of Hercules and the sacrificial banquets cost; the choicest cook is appointed for the Apaturia, the Dionysia, the Attic <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; the smoke from the banquet of Serapis will call out the firemen. Yet about the modest supper-room of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> alone a great ado is made. Our feast explains itself by its name. The Greeks call it <em>agap&egrave;</em>, i.e., affection. Whatever it costs, our outlay in the name of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is gain, since with the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the feast we benefit the needy; not as it is with you, do parasites aspire to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of satisfying their licentious propensities, selling themselves for a belly-feast to all disgraceful treatment&mdash;but as it is with God himself, a peculiar respect is shown to the lowly. If the object of our feast be good, in the light of that consider its further regulations. As it is an act of religious service, it permits no vileness or immodesty. The participants, before reclining, taste first of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As much is eaten as satisfies the cravings of hunger; as much is drunk as befits the chaste. They say it is enough, as those who remember that even during the night they have to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; they talk as those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Lord is one of their auditors. After manual ablution, and the bringing in of lights, each  is asked to stand forth and sing, as he can, a hymn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either one from the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> or one of his own composing&mdash;a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the measure of our drinking. As the feast commenced with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, so with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> it is closed. We go from it, not like troops of mischief-doers, nor bands of vagabonds, nor to break out into licentious acts, but to have as much care of our modesty and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> as if we had been at a school of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> rather than a banquet. Give the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> its due, and hold it unlawful, if it is like assemblies of the illicit sort: by all means let it be condemned, if any complaint can be validly laid against it, such as lies against secret factions. But who has ever suffered harm from our assemblies? We are in our congregations just what we are when separated from each other; we are as a community what we are individuals; we injure nobody, we trouble nobody. When the upright, when the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> meet together, when the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, when the pure assemble in congregation, you ought not to call that a faction, but a <em>curia</em>&mdash; [i.e., the court of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.]</p>

<h2>Chapter 40</h2>

<p>On the contrary, <em>they</em> deserve the name of faction who conspire to bring odium on good men and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, who cry out against innocent blood, offering as the justification of their enmity the baseless plea, that they think the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every public disaster, of every affliction with which the people are visited. If the Tiber rises as high as the city walls, if the Nile does not send its waters up over the fields, if the heavens give no rain, if there is an earthquake, if there is famine or pestilence, straightway the cry  is, <q>Away with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to the lion!</q> What! shall you give such multitudes to a single beast? Pray, tell me how many calamities befell the world and particular cities before <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> reigned&mdash; before the coming, that is, of Christ? We read of the islands of Hiera, and Anaphe, and Delos, and Rhodes, and Cos, with many thousands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, having been swallowed up. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> informs us that a region larger than Asia or Africa was seized by the Atlantic Ocean. An earthquake, too, drank up the Corinthian sea; and the force of the waves cut off a part of Lucania, whence it obtained the name of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. These things surely could not have taken place without the inhabitants suffering by them. But where&mdash; I do not say were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, those despisers of your gods&mdash; but where were your gods themselves in those days, when the flood poured its destroying waters over all the world, or, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> thought, merely the level portion of it? For that they are of later date than that calamity, the very cities in which they were born and died, nay, which they founded, bear ample testimony; for the cities could have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> at this day unless as belonging to postdiluvian times. Palestine had not yet received from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> its Jewish swarm (of emigrants), nor had the race from which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> sprung yet settled down there, when its neighbors <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> were consumed by fire from heaven. The country yet smells of that conflagration; and if there are apples there upon the trees, it is only a promise to the eye they give&mdash; you but touch them, and they turn to ashes. Nor had Tuscia and Campania to complain of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the days when fire from heaven overwhelmed Vulsinii, and Pompeii was destroyed by fire from its own mountain. No one yet worshipped the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, when Hannibal at Cann&aelig; counted the Roman slain by the pecks of Roman rings. Your gods were all objects of adoration, universally acknowledged, when the Senones closely besieged the very Capitol. And it is in keeping with all this, that if adversity has at any time befallen cities, the temples and the walls have equally shared in the disaster, so that it is clear to demonstration the thing was not the doing of the gods, seeing it also overtook themselves. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> has always deserved ill at God's hand. First of all, as undutiful to Him, because when it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him in part, it not only did not seek after Him, but even invented other gods of its own to worship; and further, because, as the result of their willing <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the Teacher of righteousness, the Judge and Avenger of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and crimes grew and flourished. But had men sought, they would have come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> object of their seeking; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> would have produced <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> would have found a gracious instead of an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> God. They ought then to see that the very same God is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them now as in ancient times, before <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were so much as spoken of. It was <em>His</em> blessings they enjoyed&mdash; created before they made any of their deities: and why can they not take it in, that their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> come from the Being whose goodness they have failed to recognize? They suffer at the hands of Him to whom they have been ungrateful. And, for all that is said, if we compare the calamities of former times, they fall on us more lightly now, since God gave <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to the world; for from that time <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> put some restraint on the world's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and men began to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the averting of God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. In a word, when the summer clouds give no rain, and the season is matter of anxiety, you indeed&mdash; full of feasting day by day, and ever eager for the banquet, baths and taverns and brothels always busy&mdash; offer up to Jupiter your rain-<a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; you enjoin on the people barefoot processions; you seek heaven at the Capitol; you look up to the temple-ceilings for the longed-for clouds&mdash; God and heaven not in all your thoughts. We, dried up with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, and our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> bound tightly up, holding back as long as possible from all the ordinary enjoyments of life, rolling in sackcloth and ashes, assail heaven with our importunities&mdash; touch God's heart&mdash; and when we have extorted divine compassion, why, Jupiter gets all the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>!</p>

<h2>Chapter 41</h2>

<p>You, therefore, are the sources of trouble in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs; on you lies the blame of public adversities, since you are ever attracting them&mdash; you by whom God is despised and images are worshipped. It should surely seem the more natural thing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it is the neglected One who is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and not they to whom all homage is paid; or most <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> they act, if, on account of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, they send trouble on their own devotees, whom they are bound to keep clear of the punishments of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. But this, you say, hits your God as well, since He permits His worshippers to suffer on account of those who dishonour Him. But admit first of all His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> arrangings, and you will not make this retort. For He who once for all appointed an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> judgment at the world's close, does not precipitate the separation, which is essential to judgment, before the end. Meanwhile He deals with all sorts of men alike, so that all together share His favours and reproofs. His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is, that outcasts and elect should have adversities and prosperities in common, that we should have all the same experience of His goodness and severity. Having learned these things from His own lips, we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> His goodness, we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, while both by you are treated with contempt; and hence the sufferings of life, so far as it is our lot to be overtaken by them, are in our case gracious admonitions, while in yours they are divine punishments. We indeed are not the least put about: for, first, only one thing in this life greatly concerns us, and that is, to get quickly out of it; and next, if any adversity befalls us, it is laid to the door of your transgressions. Nay, though we are likewise involved in troubles because of our close connection with you, we are rather glad of it, because we recognize in it divine foretellings, which, in fact, go to confirm the confidence and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of our hope. But if all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> you endure are inflicted on you by the gods you worship out of spite to us, why do you continue to pay homage to beings so ungrateful, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>; who, instead of being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with you, should rather have been aiding and abetting you by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>&mdash; keeping <em>you</em> clear of their sufferings?</p>

<h2>Chapter 42</h2>

<p>But we are called to account as harm-doers on another  ground, and are accused of being useless in the affairs of life. How in all the world can that be the case with people who are living among you, eating the same food, wearing the same attire, having the same habits, under the same necessities of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>? We are not Indian Brahmins or Gymnosophists, who dwell in woods and exile themselves from ordinary <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. We do not forget the debt of gratitude we owe to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our Lord and Creator; we reject no creature of His hands, though certainly we exercise restraint upon ourselves, lest of any gift of His we make an immoderate or sinful use. So we sojourn with you in the world, abjuring neither forum, nor shambles, nor bath, nor booth, nor workshop, nor inn, nor weekly market, nor any other places of commerce. We sail with you, and fight with you,  and till the ground with you; and in like manner we unite with you in your traffickings&mdash; even in the various arts we make public property of our works for your benefit. How it is we seem useless in your ordinary business, living with you and by you as we do, I am not able to understand. But if I do not frequent your religious ceremonies, I am still on the sacred day a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. I do not at the Saturnalia bathe myself at dawn, that I may not lose both day and night; yet I bathe at a decent and healthful hour, which preserves me both in heat and blood. I can be rigid and pallid like you after ablution when I am dead. I do not recline in public at the feast of Bacchus, after the manner of the beast-fighters at their final banquet. Yet of your resources I partake, <em>wherever</em> I may chance to eat. I do not buy a crown for my head. What matters it to you how I use them, if nevertheless the flowers are purchased? I think it more agreeable to have them free and loose, waving all about. Even if they are woven into a crown, we smell the crown with our nostrils: let those look to it who scent the perfume with their hair. We do not go to your spectacles; yet the articles that are sold there, if I need them, I will obtain more readily at their proper places. We certainly buy no frankincense. If the Arabias complain of this, let the Sab&aelig;ans be well assured that their more precious and costly merchandise is expended as largely in the burying of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>  as in the fumigating of the gods. At any rate, you say, the temple revenues are every day falling off:  how few now throw in a contribution! In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we are not able to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> both to your <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and your heavenly mendicants; nor do we think that we are required to give any but to those who ask for it. Let Jupiter then hold out his hand and get, for our compassion spends more in the streets than yours does in the temples. But your other taxes will acknowledge a debt of gratitude to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; for in the faithfulness which keeps us from fraud upon a brother, we make <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of paying all their dues: so that, by ascertaining how much is lost by fraud and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> in the census declarations&mdash; the calculation may easily be made&mdash; it would be seen that the ground of complaint in one department of revenue is compensated by the advantage which others derive.</p>

<h2>Chapter 43</h2>

<p>I will confess, however, without hesitation, that there are some who in a sense may complain of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that they are a sterile race: as, for instance, pimps, and panders, and bath-suppliers; assassins, and poisoners, and sorcerers; soothsayers, too, <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, and astrologers. But it is a noble fruit of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that they have no fruits for such as these. And yet, whatever loss your interests suffer from the religion we profess, the protection you have from us makes amply up for it. What value do you set on <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, I do not here urge who deliver you from <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, I do not urge who for your sakes present <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> before the throne of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for perhaps you have no belief in that&mdash; but from whom you can have nothing to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 44</h2>

<p>Yes, and no one considers what the loss is to the common good,&mdash; a loss as great as it is real, no one estimates the injury entailed upon the state, when, men of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as we are, we are <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in such numbers; when so many of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good suffer the last penalty. And here we call your own acts to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, you who are daily presiding at the trials of prisoners, and passing sentence upon crimes. Well, in your long lists of those accused  of many and various atrocities, has any assassin, any cutpurse, any man guilty of sacrilege, or seduction, or stealing bathers' clothes, his name entered as being a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> too? Or when <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are brought before you on the mere ground of their name, is there ever found among them an ill-doer of the sort? It is always with your folk the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> is steaming, the mines are sighing, the wild beasts are fed: it is from you the exhibitors of gladiatorial shows always get their herds of criminals to feed up for the occasion. You find no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> there, except simply as being such; or if one is there as something else, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> he is no longer. </p>

<h2>Chapter 45</h2>

<p>We, then, alone are without crime. Is there ought wonderful in that, if it be a very necessity with us? For a necessity indeed it is. Taught of God himself what goodness is, we have both a perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it as revealed to us by a perfect Master; and faithfully we do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as enjoined on us by a Judge we dare not despise. But your ideas of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> you have got from mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> opinion; on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> authority, too, its obligation rests: hence your system of practical morality is deficient, both in the fullness and authority requisite to produce a life of real <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Man's wisdom to point out what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is no greater than his authority to exact the keeping of it; the one is as easily deceived as the other is despised. And so, which is the ampler rule, to say, <q>You shall not kill,</q> or to teach, <q>Be not even <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>?</q> Which is more perfect, to forbid <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or to restrain from even a single lustful look? Which indicates the higher intelligence, interdicting evil-doing, or evil-speaking? Which is more thorough, not allowing an injury, or not even suffering an injury done to you to be repaid? Though withal you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these very <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> also of yours, which seem to lead to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, have been borrowed from the law of God as the ancient model. Of the age of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> we have already spoken. But what is the real authority of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, when it is in man's power both to evade them, by generally managing to hide himself out of sight in his crimes, and to despise them sometimes, if inclination or necessity leads him to offend? Think of these things, too, in the light of the brevity of any punishment you can inflict&mdash; never to last longer than till death. On this ground <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> makes light of all suffering and pain, maintaining that if it is small, it is contemptible; and if it is great, it is not long-continued. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about it, we, who receive our awards under the judgment of an all-seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who look forward to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment from Him for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash;we alone make real effort to attain a blameless life, under the influence of our ampler <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the impossibility of concealment, and the greatness of the threatened torment, not merely long-enduring but everlasting, fearing Him, whom he too should <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> who the fearing judges,&mdash; even <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I mean, and not the proconsul.</p>

<h2>Chapter 46</h2>

<p>We have sufficiently met, as I think, the accusation of the various crimes on the ground of which these fierce demands are made for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> blood. We have made a full exhibition of our case; and we have shown you how we are able to prove that our statement is correct, from the trustworthiness, I mean, and antiquity of our sacred writings, and from the confession likewise of the powers of spiritual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> themselves. Who will venture to undertake our refutation; not with skill of words, but, as we have managed our demonstration, on the basis of reality? But while the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we hold is made clear to all, unbelief meanwhile, at the very time it is convinced of the worth of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, which has now become well known for its benefits as well as from the intercourse of life, takes up the notion that it is not really a thing divine, but rather a kind of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. These are the very things, it says, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> counsel and profess&mdash; innocence, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, patience, sobriety, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Why, then, are we not permitted an equal liberty and impunity for our doctrines as they have, with whom, in respect of what we teach, we are compared? Or why are not they, as so like us, not pressed to the same offices, for declining which our lives are imperilled? For who compels a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> or take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, or put out useless lamps at midday? Nay, they openly overthrow your gods, and in their writings they attack your <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>; and you applaud them for it. Many of them even, with your countenance, bark out against your rulers, and are rewarded with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and salaries, instead of being given to the wild beasts. And very right it should be so. For they are called <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. This name of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> has no power to put <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to the rout. Why are they not able to do that too? Since <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> count <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> inferior to gods. Socrates used to say, <q>If the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> grant permission.</q> Yet he, too, though in denying the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of your divinities he had a glimpse of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, at his dying ordered a cock to be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to &AElig;sculapius, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his father,  for Apollo pronounced Socrates the wisest of men. Thoughtless Apollo! Testifying to the wisdom of the man who denied the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of his race. In proportion to the enmity the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> awakens, you give offense by faithfully standing by it; but the man who corrupts and makes a mere pretence of it precisely on this ground gains favour with its persecutors. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, these mockers and corrupters of it, with hostile ends merely affect to hold, and in doing so deprave, caring for nought but <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> both intensely and intimately long for and maintain in its integrity, as those who have a real concern about their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. So that we are like each other neither in our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> nor our ways, as you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>. For what certain information did Thales, the first of natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, give in reply to the inquiry of Cr&oelig;sus regarding Deity, the delay for further thought so often proving in vain? There is not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> workman but finds out <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and manifests Him, and hence assigns to Him all those attributes which go to constitute a divine being, though <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> affirms that it is far from easy to discover the Maker of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; and when He is found, it is difficult to make Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all. But if we challenge you to comparison in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, I turn to a part of the sentence passed by the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> against Socrates, who was pronounced a corrupter of youth. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> confines himself to the female sex. I have read also how the harlot Phryne kindled in Diogenes the fires of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and how a certain Speusippus, of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> school, perished in the adulterous act. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> husband has nothing to do with any but his own wife. Democritus, in putting out his eyes, because he could not look on <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> without lusting after them, and was pained if his passion was not satisfied, owns plainly, by the punishment he inflicts, his incontinence. But a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> with grace-healed eyes is sightless in this matter; he is mentally blind against the assaults of passion. If I maintain our superior modesty of behaviour, there at once occurs to me Diogenes with filth-covered feet trampling on the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> couches of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, under the influence of another <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>: the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not even play the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> man to the pauper. If sobriety of spirit be the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in debate, why, there are Pythagoras at Thurii, and Zeno at Priene, ambitious of the supreme power: the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not aspire to the &aelig;dileship. If equanimity be the contention, you have Lycurgus choosing death by self-starvation, because the Lacons had made some emendation of his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>: the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, even when he is condemned, gives thanks.  If the comparison be made in regard to trustworthiness, Anaxagoras denied the deposit of his enemies: the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is noted for his fidelity even among those who are not of his religion. If the matter of sincerity is to be brought to trial, Aristotle basely thrust his friend Hermias from his place: the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does no harm even to his foe. With equal baseness does Aristotle play the sycophant to Alexander, instead of exercising to keep him in the right way, and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> allows himself to be bought by Dionysius for his belly's sake. Aristippus in the purple, with all his great show of gravity, gives way to extravagance; and Hippias is <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> laying plots against the state: no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ever attempted such a thing in behalf of his brethren, even when <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was scattering them abroad with every atrocity. But it will be said that some of us, too, depart from the rules of our discipline. In that case, however, we count them no longer <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who do such things retain still the name and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of wisdom. So, then, where is there any likeness between the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>? Between the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Greece and of heaven? Between the man whose object is fame, and whose object is life? Between the talker and the doer? Between the man who builds up and the man who pulls down? Between the friend and the foe of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>? Between one who corrupts the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and one who restores and teaches it? Between its chief and its custodier?</p>

<h2>Chapter 47</h2>

<p>Unless I am utterly mistaken, there is nothing so old as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and the already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> antiquity of the divine writings is so far of use to me, that it leads men more easily to take it in that they are the treasure-source whence all later wisdom has been taken. And were it not necessary to keep my work to a moderate size, I might launch forth also into the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this. What poet or sophist has not drunk at the fountain of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? Thence, accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> watered their arid minds, so that it is the things they have from us which bring us into comparison with them. For this reason, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was banished by certain states&mdash; I mean by the Thebans, by the Spartans also, and the Argives&mdash; its <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> sought to imitate our doctrines; and ambitious, as I have said, of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and eloquence alone, if they fell upon anything in the collection of sacred Scriptures which displeased them, in their own peculiar style of research, they perverted it to serve their purpose: for they had no adequate <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in their divinity to keep them from changing them, nor had they any sufficient understanding of them, either, as being still at the time under veil&mdash; even obscure to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves, whose peculiar possession they seemed to be. For so, too, if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was distinguished by its simplicity, the more on that account the fastidiousness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, too <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, set to altering it; so that even what they found certain they made uncertain by their admixtures. Finding a simple revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they proceeded to dispute about Him, not as He had revealed to them, but turned aside to debate about His properties, His nature, His abode. Some assert Him to be incorporeal; others maintain He has a body&mdash;the Platonists teaching the one doctrine, and the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> the other. Some think that He is composed of atoms, others of numbers: such are the different views of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> and Pythagoras. One thinks He is made of fire; so it appeared to Heraclitus. The Platonists, again, hold that He administers the affairs of the world; the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, on the contrary, that He is idle and inactive, and, so to speak, a nobody in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things. Then the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> represent Him as placed outside the world, and whirling round this huge mass from without like a potter; while the Platonists place Him within the world, as a pilot is in the ship he steers. So, in like manner, they differ in their views about the world itself, whether it is created or uncreated, whether it is destined to pass away or to remain for ever. So again it is debated concerning the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which some contend is divine and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, while others hold that it is dissoluble. According to each one's fancy, He has introduced either something new, or refashioned the old. Nor need we wonder if the speculations of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have perverted the older Scriptures. Some of their brood, with their opinions, have even adulterated our new-given <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> revelation, and corrupted it into a system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> doctrines, and from the one path have struck off many and inexplicable by-roads.  And I have alluded to this, lest any one becoming acquainted with the variety of parties among us, this might seem to him to put us on a level with the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and he might condemn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the different ways in which it is defended. But we at once put in a plea in bar against these tainters of our purity, asserting that this is the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which comes down from Christ by transmission through His companions, to whom we shall prove that those devisers of different doctrines are all posterior. Everything opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has been got up from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, the spirits of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> carrying on this system of opposition. By them all corruptions of wholesome discipline have been secretly instigated; by them, too, certain fables have been introduced, that, by their resemblance to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they might impair its credibility, or vindicate their own higher claims to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; so that people might think <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> unworthy of credit because the poets or <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are so, or might regard the poets and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> as worthier of confidence from their not being followers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Accordingly, we get ourselves laughed at for proclaiming that God will one day judge the world. For, like us, the poets and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> set up a judgment-seat in the realms below. And if we threaten Gehenna, which is a reservoir of secret fire under the earth for purposes of punishment, we have in the same way derision heaped on us. For so, too, they have their Pyriphlegethon, a river of flame in the regions of the dead. And if we speak of Paradise,  the place of heavenly bliss appointed to receive the spirits of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, severed from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this world by that fiery zone as by a sort of enclosure, the Elysian plains have taken possession of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Whence is it, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you have all this, so like us, in the poets and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>? The reason simply is, that they have been taken from our religion. But if they are taken from our sacred things, as being of earlier date, then ours are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a>, and have higher claims upon belief, since even their imitations find <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among you. If they maintain their sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> to have sprung from their own minds, in that case ours will be reflections of what are later than themselves, which by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things is impossible, for never does the shadow precede the body which casts it, or the image the reality. </p>

<h2>Chapter 48</h2>

<p>Come now, if some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> affirms, as Laberius holds, following an opinion of Pythagoras, that a man may have his origin from a mule, a serpent from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and with skill of speech twists every argument to prove his view, will he not gain acceptance for and work in some the conviction that, on account of this, they should even abstain from eating animal food? May any one have the persuasion that he should so abstain, lest by chance in his beef he eats of some ancestor of his? But if a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> promises the return of a man from a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the very actual Gaius from Gaius,  the cry of the people will be to have him <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>; they will not even so much as grant him a hearing. If there is any ground for the moving to and fro of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> into different bodies, why may they not return into the very substance they have left, seeing this is to be restored, to be that which had been? They are no longer the very things they had been; for they could not be what they were not, without first ceasing to be what they had been. If we were inclined to give all rein upon this point, discussing into what various beasts one and another might probably be changed, we would need at our leisure to take up many points. But this we would do chiefly in our own defence, as setting forth what is greatly worthier of belief, that a man will come back from a man&mdash; any given person from any given person, still retaining his humanity; so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, with its qualities unchanged, may be restored to the same condition, thought not to the same outward framework. Assuredly, as the reason why restoration takes place at all is the appointed judgment, every man must needs come forth the very same who had once <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, that he may receive at God's hands a judgment, whether of good desert or the opposite. And therefore the body too will appear; for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not capable of suffering without the solid substance (that is, the flesh; and for this reason, also) that it is not right that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> should have all the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God to bear: they did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without the body, within which all was done by them. But how, you say, can a substance which has been dissolved be made to reappear again? Consider yourself, O man, and you will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in it! Reflect on what you were before you came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Nothing. For if you had been anything, you would have remembered it. You, then, who were nothing before you <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, reduced to nothing also when you cease to be, why may you not come into being again out of nothing, at the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the same Creator whose will created you out of nothing at the first? Will it be anything new in your case? You who were not, <em>were</em> made; when you cease to be again, you <em>shall</em> be made. Explain, if you can, your original creation, and then demand to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how you shall be re-created. Indeed, it will be still easier surely to make you what you were once, when the very same creative power made you without difficulty what you never were before. There will be doubts, perhaps, as to the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of Him who hung in its place this huge body of our world, made out of what had never <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, as from a death of emptiness and inanity, animated by the Spirit who quickens all living things, its very self the unmistakable type of the resurrection, that it might be to you a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>&mdash; nay, the exact image of the resurrection. Light, every day extinguished, shines out again; and, with like alternation, darkness succeeds light's outgoing. The defunct stars re-live; the seasons, as soon as they are finished, renew their course; the fruits are brought to maturity, and then are reproduced. The seeds do not spring up with abundant produce, save as they rot and dissolve away&mdash;all things are preserved by perishing, all things are refashioned out of death. You, man of nature so exalted, if you understand yourself, taught even by the Pythian  words, lord of all these things that die and rise,&mdash; shall you die to perish evermore? Wherever your dissolution shall have taken place, whatever material agent has destroyed you, or swallowed you up, or swept you away, or reduced you to nothingness, it shall again restore you. Even nothingness is His who is Lord of <em>all</em>. You ask, Shall we then be always dying, and rising up from death? If so the Lord of all things had appointed, you would have to submit, though unwillingly, to the law of your creation. But, in fact, He has no other purpose than that of which He has informed us. The Reason which made the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> out of diverse elements, so that all things might be composed of opposite substances in unity&mdash; of void and solid, of animate and inanimate, of comprehensible and incomprehensible, of light and darkness, of life itself and death&mdash; has also disposed time into order, by fixing and distinguishing its mode, according to which this first portion of it, which we inhabit from the beginning of the world, flows down by a temporal course to a close; but the portion which succeeds, and to which we look forward continues forever. When, therefore, the boundary and limit, that millennial interspace, has been passed, when even the outward fashion of the world itself&mdash; which has been spread like a veil over the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> economy, equally a thing of time&mdash; passes away, then the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> shall be raised again, to have its dues meted out according as it has merited in the period of good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and thereafter to have these paid out through the immeasurable ages of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Therefore after this there is neither death nor repeated resurrections, but we shall be the same that we are now, and still unchanged&mdash; the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ever with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, clothed upon with the proper substance of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; but the profane, and all who are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worshippers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in like manner shall be consigned to the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>&mdash; that fire which, from its very nature indeed, directly ministers to their incorruptibility. The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are familiar as well as we with the distinction between a common and a secret fire. Thus that which is in common use is far different from that which we see in divine judgments, whether striking as thunderbolts from heaven, or bursting up out of the earth through mountain-tops; for it does not consume what it scorches, but while it burns it repairs. So the mountains continue ever burning; and a person struck by lighting is even now kept safe from any destroying flame. A notable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> this of the fire <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>! A notable example of the endless judgment which still supplies punishment with fuel! The mountains burn, and last. How will it be with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and the enemies of God? </p>

<h2>Chapter 49</h2>

<p>These are what are called presumptuous speculations in our case alone; in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and poets they are regarded as sublime speculations and illustrious discoveries. They are men of wisdom, we are fools. They are worthy of all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, we are folk to have the finger pointed at; nay, besides that, we are even to have punishments inflicted on us. But let things which are the defence of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if you will, have no foundation, and give them duly the name of fancies, yet still they are necessary; let them be absurd if you will, yet they are of use: they make all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them better men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, under the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of never-ending punishment and the hope of never-ending bliss. It is not, then, wise to brand as false, nor to regard as absurd, things the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of which it is expedient to presume. On no ground is it right positively to condemn as bad what beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is profitable. Thus, in fact, you are guilty of the very presumption of which you accuse us, in condemning what is useful. It is equally out of the question to regard them as nonsensical; at any rate, if they are false and foolish, they hurt nobody. For they are just (in that case) like many other things on which you inflict no penalties&mdash; foolish and fabulous things, I mean, which, as quite innocuous, are never charged as crimes or punished. But in a thing of the kind, if this be so indeed, we should be adjudged to ridicule, not to swords, and flames, and crosses, and wild beasts, in which iniquitous cruelty not only the blinded populace exults and insults over us, but in which some of you too <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, not scrupling to gain the popular favour by your <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. As though all you can do to us did not depend upon our pleasure. It is assuredly a matter of my own inclination, being a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Your condemnation, then, will only reach me in that case, if I wish to be condemned; but when all you can do to me, you can do only at my will, all you can do is dependent on my will, and is not in your power. The <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the people in our trouble is therefore utterly reasonless. For it is our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> they appropriate to themselves, since we would far rather be condemned than <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; on the contrary, our haters should be sorry rather than <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, as we have obtained the very thing of our own choice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 50</h2>

<p>In that case, you say, why do you complain of our <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>? You ought rather to be grateful to us for giving you the sufferings you want. Well, it is quite <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that it is our desire to suffer, but it is in the way that the soldier longs for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. No one indeed suffers willingly, since suffering necessarily implies <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and danger. Yet the man who objected to the conflict, both fights with all his strength, and when victorious, he rejoices in the battle, because he reaps from it <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and spoil. It is our battle to be summoned to your tribunals that there, under <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of execution, we may battle for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But the day is won when the object of the struggle is gained. This victory of ours gives us the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of pleasing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the spoil of life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But we are overcome. Yes, when we have obtained our wishes. Therefore we conquer in dying;  we go forth victorious at the very time we are subdued. Call us, if you like, <em>Sarmenticii</em> and <em>Semaxii</em>, because, bound to a half-axle stake, we are burned in a circle-heap of fagots. This is the attitude in which we conquer, it is our victory-robe, it is for us a sort of triumphal car. Naturally enough, therefore, we do not please the vanquished; on account of this, indeed, we are counted a desperate, reckless race. But the very desperation and recklessness you object to in us, among yourselves lift high the standard of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and of fame. Mucius of his own will left his right hand on the altar: what sublimity of mind! Empedocles gave his whole body at Catana to the fires of &AElig;tna: what mental resolution! A certain foundress of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> gave herself away in second marriage to the funeral pile: what a noble <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>! Regulus, not wishing that his one life should count for the lives of many enemies, endured these crosses over all his frame: how brave a man&mdash; even in captivity a conqueror! Anaxarchus, when he was being beaten to death by a barley-pounder, cried out, <q>Beat on, beat on at the case of Anaxarchus; no stroke falls on Anaxarchus himself.</q> O magnanimity of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, who even in such an end had jokes upon his lips! I omit all reference to those who with their own sword, or with any other milder form of death, have bargained for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Nay, see how even torture contests are crowned by you. The Athenian courtezan, having wearied out the executioner, at last bit off her tongue and spat it in the face of the raging tyrant, that she might at the same time spit away her power of speech, nor be longer able to confess her fellow-conspirators, if even overcome, that might be her inclination. Zeno the Eleatic, when he was asked by Dionysius what good <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> did, on answering that it gave contempt of death, was all unquailing, given over to the tyrant's scourge, and sealed his opinion even to the death. We all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how the Spartan lash, applied with the utmost cruelty under the very eyes of friends encouraging, confers on those who bear it <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> proportionate to the blood which the young men shed. O <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> legitimate, because it is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, for whose sake it is counted neither reckless foolhardiness, nor desperate obstinacy, to despise death itself and all sorts of savage treatment; for whose sake you may for your native place, for the empire, for friendship, endure all you are forbidden to do for God! And you cast <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> such as these, and you put inscriptions upon images, and cut out epitaphs on tombs, that their names may never perish. In so far you can by your monuments, you yourselves afford a sort of resurrection to the dead. Yet he who expects the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> resurrection from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is insane, if for God he suffers! But go <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> on, good presidents, you will stand higher with the people if you <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at their wish, kill us, torture us, condemn us, grind us to dust; your <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that we are innocent. Therefore God suffers that we thus suffer; for but very lately, in condemning a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to the <em>leno</em> rather than to the <em>leo</em> you made confession that a taint on our purity is considered among us something more terrible than any punishment and any death.  Nor does your cruelty, however exquisite, avail you; it is rather a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to us. The oftener we are mown down by you, the more in number we grow; <em>the blood of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is seed</em>.  Many of your writers exhort to the courageous bearing of pain and death, as Cicero in the <em>Tusculans</em>, as Seneca in his <em>Chances</em>, as Diogenes, Pyrrhus, Callinicus; and yet their words do not find so many <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do, teachers not by words, but by their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. That very obstinacy you rail against is the preceptress. For who that contemplates it, is not excited to inquire what is at the bottom of it? Who, after inquiry, does not embrace our doctrines? And when he has embraced them, desires not to suffer that he may become partaker of the fullness of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that he may obtain from God complete forgiveness, by giving in exchange his blood? For that secures the remission of all offenses. On this account it is that we return thanks on the very spot for your sentences. As the divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> are ever opposed to each other, when we are condemned by you, we are acquitted by the Highest.</p>
