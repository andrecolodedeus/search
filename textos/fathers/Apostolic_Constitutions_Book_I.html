<h1>Apostolic Constitutions (Book I)</h1>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Concerning the Laity.</strong></p>

<h2>Section 1. General Commandments</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and elders to all those who from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>; <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and peace from Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, be multiplied unto you in the acknowledgment of Him. </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the plantation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His beloved vineyard; <span class="stiki" id="note072538"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;5:7,&nbsp;2</a></span> containing those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His unerring divine religion; who are the heirs by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of His everlasting kingdom; who are partakers of His divine influence, and of the communication of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; who are armed through Jesus, and have received His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> into their hearts; who enjoy the benefit of the sprinkling of the precious and innocent blood of Christ; who have free liberty to call Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Father; being fellow-heirs and joint-partakers of His beloved Son: hearken to this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> doctrine, you who enjoy His promises, as being delivered by the command of your Saviour, and agreeable to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> words. Take care, you children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to do all things in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in all things please Christ our Lord.  For if any man follows unrighteousness, and does those things that are contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, such a one will be esteemed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the disobedient <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. </p>
<h3>Concerning Covetousness.</h3>

<p>I. Abstain, therefore, from all unlawful desires and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. For it is written in the law, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> your neighbour's wife, nor his field, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is your neighbour's;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072540"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse17">Exodus&nbsp;20:17</a></span> for all <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> of these things is from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one. For he that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> his neighbour's wife, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, is already in his mind an adulterer and a thief; and if he does not repent, is condemned by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>: through whom  <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be to God for ever, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. For He says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, recapitulating, and confirming, and fulfilling the ten commandments of the law: <q>It is written in the law, You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: but I say unto you, that is, I said in the law, by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. But now I say unto you myself, Whosoever shall look on his neighbour's wife to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her, has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her already in his heart.</q>  Such a one is condemned of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, who <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> his neighbour's wife in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. But does not he that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> an ox or an ass design to steal them? To apply them to his own use, and to lead them away? Or, again, does not he that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> a field, and continues in such a disposition, wickedly contrive how to remove the landmarks, and to compel the possessor to part with somewhat for nothing? For as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> somewhere speaks: <q>Woe to those who join house to house, and lay field to field, that they may deprive their neighbour of somewhat which was his.</q>  Wherefore he says: <q>Must you alone inhabit the earth? For these things have been heard in the ears of the Lord of hosts.</q> And elsewhere: <q>Cursed be he who removes his neighbour's landmarks: and all the people shall say, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072544"><a href="../bible/deu027.htm">Deuteronomy&nbsp;27:17</a></span> Wherefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says: <q>You shall not remove your neighbour's landmarks <span class="stiki" id="note072545"><a href="../bible/deu019.htm#verse14">Deuteronomy&nbsp;19:14</a></span> <span style="italic">which your fathers have set</span> .</q>  Upon this account, therefore, terrors, death, tribunals, and condemnations follow such as these from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But as to those who are <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is one law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span style="italic">simple,</span>  <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, living, which is this: <q>Do not that to another which you hate another should do to you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072548"><a href="../bible/tob004.htm#verse16">Tobit&nbsp;4:16</a></span> You would not that any one should look upon your wife with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> design to corrupt her; do not, therefore, look upon your neighbour's wife with a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> intention. You would not that your garment should be taken away; do not, therefore, take away another's. You would not be beaten, reproached, affronted; do not, therefore, serve any other in the like manner. </p>
<h3>That We Ought Not to Return Injuries, Nor Revenge Ourselves on Him that Does Us Wrong.</h3>

<p>II. But if any one curse you, bless him. For it is written in the book of Numbers: <q>He that blesses you is blessed, and he that curses you is cursed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072549"><a href="../bible/num024.htm#verse9">Numbers&nbsp;24:9</a></span> In the same manner it is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Bless those who curse you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072550"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;6:28</a></span> Being injured, do not avenge yourselves, but bear it with patience; for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> speaks thus: <q>Say not, I will avenge myself on my enemy for what injuries he has offered me; but acquiesce under them, that the Lord may right you, and bring vengeance upon him who injures you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072551"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;20:22</a></span> For so says He again in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Love your enemies, do good to those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them which despitefully use you and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you; and you shall be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for He makes His sun to shine on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and on the good, and rains on the just and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072552"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44-45</a></span> Let us therefore, beloved, attend to these commandments, that we may be found to be the children of light by doing them. Bear, therefore, with one another, you servants and sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<h2>Section 2. Commandments to Men</h2>

<h3>Concerning the Adornment of Ourselves, and the Sin Which Arises from Thence.</h3>

<p>Let the husband not be insolent nor arrogant towards his wife; but compassionate, bountiful, willing to please his own wife <span style="italic">alone,</span>  and treat her honourably and obligingly, endeavouring to be agreeable to her; (III.) not adorning yourself in such a manner as may entice another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to you. For if you are overcome by her, and sinnest with her, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death will overtake you from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and you will be punished with sensible and bitter torments. Or if you do not perpetrate such a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> act, but shakest her off, and refusest her, in this case you are not wholly innocent, even though you are not guilty of the crime itself, but only in so far as through your adorning you enticed the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to desire you. For you are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was so affected, and by her lusting after you was guilty of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with you: yet are you not so guilty, because you did not send to her, who was ensnared by you; nor did you desire her. Since, therefore, you did not deliver up yourself to her, you shall find mercy with the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has said, <q>You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>,</q> and, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>.</q>  For if such a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, upon sight of you, or unseasonable meeting with you, was smitten in her <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and sent to you, but you as a religious person refused her,  if she was wounded in her heart by your beauty, and youth, and adorning, and fell in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with you, you will be found guilty of her transgressions, as having been the occasion of scandal to her, <span class="stiki" id="note072556"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;18:7</a></span> <span style="italic">and shall inherit a woe.</span>  Wherefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the Lord God that no mischief may befall you upon this account: for you are not to please men, so as to commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so as to attain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life, and be partaker of everlasting rest. That beauty which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and nature has bestowed on you, do not further beautify; but modestly diminish it before men. Thus, do not permit the hair of your head to grow too long, but rather cut it short; lest by a nice combing your hair, and wearing it long, and anointing yourself, you draw upon yourself such ensnared or ensnaring <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Neither do you wear over-fine garments to seduce any; neither do you, with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> subtlety, affect over-fine stockings or shoes for your feet, but only such as suit the measures of decency and usefulness. Neither do you put a gold ring upon your fingers; for all these ornaments are the signs of lasciviousness, which if you be solicitous about in an indecent manner, you will not act as becomes a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man: for it is not lawful for you, a believer and a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to permit the hair of your head to grow long, and to brush it up together, nor to suffer it to spread abroad, nor to puff it up, nor by nice combing and platting to make it curl and shine; since that is contrary to the law, which says thus, in its additional precepts: <q>You shall not make to yourselves curls and round rasures.</q>  Nor may men destroy the hair of their beards, and unnaturally change the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For the law says: <q>You shall not mar your beards.</q>  For God the Creator has made this decent for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, but has determined that it is unsuitable for men. But if you do these things to please men, in contradiction to the law, you will be abominable with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who created you after His own image. If, therefore, you will be acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, abstain from all those things which He <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, and do none of those things that are unpleasing to Him. </p>
<h3>That We Ought Not to Be Over-Curious About Those Who Live Wickedly, But to Be Intent Upon Our Own Proper Employment.</h3>

<p>IV. You shall not be as a wanderer and drifter abroad, rambling about the streets, without just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, to spy out such as live wickedly. But by minding your own trade and employment, endeavour to do what is acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And keeping in mind the oracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, meditate in the same continually. For so the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says to you: <q>You shall meditate in His law day and night; when you walk in the field, and when you sit in your house, and when you lie down, and when you rise up, that you may have understanding in all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072560"><a href="../bible/jos001.htm#verse8">Joshua&nbsp;1:8</a>; <a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse7">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:7</a></span> Nay, although you are rich, and so do not want a trade for your maintenance, be not one that wanders about, and walks abroad at random; but either go to some that are <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and of the same religion, and confer and discourse with them about the lively oracles of God:&mdash; </p>
<h3>What Books of Scripture We Ought to Read.</h3>

<p>V. Or if you stay at home, read the books of the Law, of the Kings, with the Prophets; sing the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of David; and peruse diligently the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which is the completion of the other. </p>
<h3>That We Ought to Abstain from All the Books of Those that are Out of the Church.</h3>

<p>VI. Abstain from all the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> books. For what have you to do with such foreign discourses, or <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, which subvert the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the unstable? For what defect do you find in the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you should have recourse to those heathenish fables? For if you have a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to read history, you have the books of the Kings; if books of wisdom or poetry, you have those of the Prophets, of Job, and the Proverbs, in which you will find greater depth of sagacity than in all the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> poets and sophisters, because these are the words of the Lord, the only wise God. If you desire something to sing, you have the Psalms; if the origin of things, you have Genesis; if <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and statutes, you have the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> law of the Lord God. Therefore utterly abstain from all strange and diabolical books. Nay, when you read the law, think not yourself bound to observe the additional precepts; though not all of them, yet some of them. Read those barely for the sake of history, in order to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them, and to glorify God that He has delivered you from such great and so many bonds. Propose to yourself to distinguish what rules were from the law of nature, and what were added afterwards, or were such additional rules as were introduced and given in the wilderness to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> after the making of the calf; for the law contains those precepts which were spoken by the Lord God before the people fell into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and made a calf like the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Apis&mdash; that is, the ten commandments. But as to those bonds which were further laid upon them after they had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, do not draw them upon yourself: for our Saviour came for no other reason but that <span style="italic">He might deliver those that were obnoxious thereto from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> which was reserved far them, that</span>  He might fulfil the Law and the Prophets, and that He might abrogate or change those secondary bonds which were superadded to the rest of the law. For therefore did He call to us and say, <q>Come <em>unto me</em>,  all you that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072563"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;11:28</a></span> When, therefore, you have read the Law, which is agreeable to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and to the Prophets, read also the books of the Kings, that you may thereby learn which of the kings were righteous, and how they were prospered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and how the promise of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life continued with them from Him; but those kings which went a-whoring from God did soon perish in their <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> by the righteous judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and were deprived of His life, inheriting, instead of rest, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment. Wherefore by reading these books you will be mightily strengthened in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and edified in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whose body and member you are. Moreover, when you walk abroad in public, and have a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to bathe, make use of that bath which is appropriated to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, lest, by discovering your body in an unseemly manner to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, or by seeing a sight not seemly for men, either you get ensnared, or you ensnare and entice to yourself <span style="italic">those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who easily yield to such <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>.</span>  Take care, therefore, and avoid such things, lest you admit a snare upon your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. </p>
<h3>Concerning a Bad Woman.</h3>

<p>VII. For let us learn what the sacred word says in the book of Wisdom: <q>My son, keep my words, and hide my commandments with you. Say unto Wisdom, You are my sister; and make understanding familiar with you: that she may keep you from the strange and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, in case such a one accost you with sweet words. For from the window of her house she looks into the street, to see if she can espy some young man among the foolish children, without understanding, walking in the market-place, in the meeting of the street near her house, and talking in the dusk of the evening, or in the silence and darkness of the night. A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> meets him in the appearance of an harlot, who steals away the hearts of young <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. She rambles about, and is dissolute; her feet abide not in her house: sometimes she is without, sometimes in the streets, and lies in wait at every corner. Then she catches him, and kisses him, and with an impudent face says unto him, I have peace-offerings with me; this day do I pay my vows: therefore came I forth to meet you; earnestly I have desired your face, and I have found you. I have decked my bed with coverings; with tapestry from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> have I adorned it. I have perfumed my bed with saffron, and my house with cinnamon. Come, let us take our fill of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> until the morning; come, let us solace ourselves with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> etc. To which he adds: <q>With much discourse she seduced him, with snares from her lips she forced him. He goes after her like a silly bird.</q>  And again: <q>Do not hearken to a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; for though the lips of an harlot are like drops from an honey-comb, which for a while is smooth in your throat, yet afterwards you will find her more bitter than gall, and sharper than any two-edged sword.</q>  And again: <q>But get away quickly, and tarry not; fix not your eyes upon her: for she has thrown down many wounded; yea, innumerable multitudes have been slain by her.</q>  <q>If not,</q> says he, <q>yet you will repent at the last, when your flesh and your body are consumed, and will say, How have I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> instruction, and my heart has avoided the reproofs of the righteous! I have not hearkened to the voice of my instructor, nor inclined mine ear to my teacher. I have almost been in all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  But we will make no more quotations; and if we have omitted any, be so <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> as to select the most valuable out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, and confirm yourselves with them, rejecting all things that are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that so you may be found <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> with God in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. </p>

<h2>Section 3. Commandments to Women</h2>

<h3>Concerning the Subjection of a Wife to Her Husband, and that She Must Be Loving and Modest.</h3>

<p>VIII. Let the wife be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to her own proper husband, because <q>the husband is the head of the wife.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072569"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> But Christ is the head of that husband who walks in the way of righteousness; and <q>the head of Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> even His Father. Therefore, O wife, next after the Almighty, our God and Father, the Lord of the present world and of the world to come, the Maker of everything that breathes, and of every power; and after His beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through whom  <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> your husband, and reverence him, pleasing him alone, rendering yourself acceptable to him in the several affairs of life, that so on your account your husband may be called blessed, according to the Wisdom of Solomon, which thus speaks: <q>Who can find a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? For such a one is more precious than costly stones. The heart of her husband does safely trust in her, so that she shall have no need of spoil: for she does good to her husband all the days of her life. She buys wool and flax, and works profitable things with her hands. She is like the merchants' ships, she brings her food from far. She rises also while it is yet night, and gives meat to her household, and food to her maidens. She considers a field, and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard. She girds her loins with strength, and strengthens her arms. She tastes that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to labour; her lamp goes not out all the whole night. She stretches out her arms for useful work, and lays her hands to the spindle. She opens her hands to the needy; yea, she reaches forth her hands to the poor. Her husband takes no care of the affairs of his house; for all that are with her are clothed with double garments. She makes coats for her husband, clothings of silk and purple. Her husband is eminent in the gates, when he sits with the elders of the land. She makes fine linen, and sells it to the Ph&oelig;nicians, and girdles to the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaanites</a>. She is clothed with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and beauty, and she rejoices in the last days. She opens her mouth with wisdom and discretion, and puts her words in order. The ways of her household are strict; she eats not the bread of idleness. She will open her mouth with wisdom and caution, and upon her tongue are the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of mercy. Her children arise up and praise her for her riches, and her husband joins in her praises. Many daughters have obtained <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and done worthily, but you surpass and excellest them all. May lying flatteries and the vain beauty of a wife be far from you. For a religious wife is blessed. Let her praise the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord:  give her of the fruits of her lips, and let her husband be praised in the gates.</q>  And again: <q>A <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> wife is a crown to her husband.</q>  And again: <q>Many wives have built an house.</q>  You have learned what great commendations a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> and loving wife receives from the Lord God. If you desire to be one of the faithful, and to please the Lord, O wife, do not superadd ornaments to your beauty, in order to please other men; neither affect to wear fine broidering, garments, or shoes, to entice those who are allured by such things. For although you do not do these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> things with design of sinning yourself, but only for the sake of ornament and beauty, yet will you not so escape future punishment, as having compelled another to look so hard at you as to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after you, and as not having taken care both to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> yourself, and the affording scandal to others. But if you yield yourself up, and commit the crime, you are both guilty of your own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the ruin of the other's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also. Besides, when you have committed lewdness with one man, and beginnest to despair, you will again turn away from your duty, and follow others, and grow past feeling; as says the divine word: <q>When a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man comes into the depth of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he becomes a scorner, and then disgrace and reproach come upon him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072575"><a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse3">Proverbs&nbsp;18:3</a></span> For such a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> afterward being wounded, ensnares without restraint the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the foolish. Let us learn, therefore, how the divine word triumphs over such <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, saying: <q>I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is a snare and net to the heart of men worse than death; her hands are fetters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072576"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse26">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:26</a></span> And in another passage: <q>As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is beauty in a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072577"><a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;11:22</a></span> And again: <q>As a worm in wood, so does a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> destroy her husband.</q>  And again: <q>It is better to dwell in the corner of the house-top, than with a contentious and an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q>  You, therefore, who are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, do not imitate such as these. But you who design to be faithful to your own husband, take care to please him alone. And when you are in the streets, cover your head; for by such a covering you will avoid being viewed of idle <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Do not paint your face, which is God's workmanship; for there is no part of you which wants ornament, inasmuch as all things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made are very good. But the lascivious additional adorning of what is already good is an affront to the bounty of the Creator. Look downward when you walk abroad, veiling yourself as becomes <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. </p>
<h3>That a Woman Must Not Bathe with Men.</h3>

<p>IX. Avoid also that disorderly practice of bathing in the same place with men; for many are the nets of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one. And let not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> bathe with an hermaphrodite; for if she is to veil her face, and conceal it with modesty from strange men, how can she bear to enter naked into the bath together with men? But if the bath be appropriated to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, let her bathe orderly, modestly, and moderately. But let her not bathe without occasion, nor much, nor often, nor in the middle of the day, nor, if possible, every day; and let the tenth hour of the day be the set time for such seasonable bathing. For it is convenient that you, who are a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, should ever constantly avoid a curiosity which has many eyes. </p>
<h3>Concerning a Contentious and Brawling Woman.</h3>

<p>X. But as to a spirit of contention, be sure to curb it as to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but principally as to your husband; lest, if he be an unbeliever or an <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, he may have an occasion of scandal or of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you be partaker of a woe from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, says He, <q>Woe to him by whom My name is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>;</q>  and lest, if your husband be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, he be forced, from his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, to say that which is written in the book of Wisdom: <q>It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q>  You wives, therefore, demonstrate your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> by your modesty and meekness to all without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whether they be <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> or men, in order to their conversion and improvement in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And since we have warned you, and instructed you briefly, whom we do esteem our sisters, daughters, and members, as being wise yourselves, persevere all your lives in an unblameable course of life. Seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> such kinds of learning whereby you may arrive at the kingdom of our Lord, and please Him, and so rest for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>
