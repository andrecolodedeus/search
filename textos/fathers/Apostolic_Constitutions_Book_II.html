<p><strong>Of Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons.</strong></p>

<h2>Section 1. On Examining Candidates for the Episcopal Office</h2>

<h3>That a Bishop Must Be Well Instructed and Experienced in the Word.</h3>

<p>I. But concerning <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, we have heard from our Lord, that a pastor who is to be ordained a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the churches in every parish, must be unblameable, unreprovable, free from all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> common among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not under fifty years of age; for such a one is in good part past youthful disorders, and the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, as well as the reproaches which are sometimes cast upon many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by some false brethren, who do not consider the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Whosoever speaks an idle word shall give an account thereof to the Lord in the day of judgment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072582"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;12:36</a></span> And again: <q>By your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072583"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;12:37</a></span> Let him therefore, <span style="italic">if it is possible</span>, be well <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>; <span style="italic">but if he be unlettered, let him at any rate be</span>  skilful in the word, and of competent age. But if in a small parish one advanced in years is not to be found,  let some younger person, who has a good report among his neighbours, and is esteemed by them worthy of the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>&mdash;who has carried himself from his youth with meekness and regularity, like a much elder person,&mdash; after examination, and a general good report, be ordained in peace. For Solomon at twelve years of age was king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,  and Josiah at eight years of age reigned righteously, <span class="stiki" id="note072587"><a href="../bible/2ki022.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;22:1</a></span> and in like manner Joash governed the people at seven years of age. <span class="stiki" id="note072588"><a href="../bible/2ch024.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;24:1</a>; <a href="../bible/2ki011.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;11:3-4</a></span> Wherefore, although the person be young, let him be meek, gentle, and quiet. For the Lord God says by Esaias: <q>Upon whom will I look, but upon him who is <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and quiet, and always trembles at my words?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072589"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;66:2</a></span> In like manner it is in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> also: <q>Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072590"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;5:5</a></span> Let him also be merciful; for again it is said: <q>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072591"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;5:7</a></span> Let him also be a peacemaker; for again it is said: <q>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the sons of God.</q>  Let him also be one of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, purified from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and unrighteousness; for it is said again: <q>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072593"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> </p>
<h3>What Ought to Be the Characters of a Bishop and of the Rest of the Clergy.</h3>

<p>II. Let him therefore be sober, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, decent, firm, stable, not given to wine; no striker, but gentle; not a brawler, not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>; <q>not a novice, lest, being puffed up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, he fall into condemnation, and the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: for every one that exalts himself shall be abased.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072594"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:6</a>; <a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;14:11</a></span> Such a one a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ought to be, who has been the <q>husband of one wife,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072595"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:2</a></span> who also has herself had no other husband, <q>ruling well his own house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072596"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:4</a></span> In this manner let examination be made when he is to receive ordination, and to be placed in his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>, whether he be grave, faithful, decent; whether he has a grave and faithful wife, or has formerly had such a one; whether he has <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> his children piously, and has <q>brought them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072597"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;6:4</a></span> whether his domestics do <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and reverence him, and are all <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to him: for if those who are immediately about him for worldly concerns are seditious and disobedient, how will others not of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, when they are under his management, become <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to him? </p>
<h3>In What Things a Bishop is to Be Examined Before He is Ordained.</h3>

<p>III. Let examination also be made whether he be unblameable as to the concerns of this life; for it is written: <q>Search diligently for all the faults of him who is to be ordained for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.</q>  </p>

<h2>Section 2. On the Character and Teaching of the Bishop</h2>

<p>On which account let him also be void of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; for Wisdom says: <q>Anger destroys even the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>.</q>  Let him also be merciful, of a generous and loving temper; for our Lord says: <q>By this shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072600"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;13:35</a></span> Let him be also ready to give, a lover of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> and the stranger; ready to serve, and minister, and attend; resolute in his duty; and let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who is the most worthy of his assistance. </p>
<h3>That Charitable Distributions are Not to Be Made to Every Widow, But that Sometimes a Woman Who Has a Husband is to Be Preferred: and that No Distributions are to Be Made to Any One Who is Given to Gluttony, Drunkenness, and Idleness.</h3>

<p>IV. For if there be a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who is able to support herself, and another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is not a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, but is needy by reason of sickness, or the bringing up many children, or infirmity of her hands, let him stretch out his hand in charity rather to this latter. But if any one be in want by <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, or idleness, he does not deserve any assistance, or <span style="italic">to be esteemed a member of</span> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, speaking of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, says: <q>The <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> hides his hand in his bosom, and is not able to bring it to his mouth again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072601"><a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse24">Proverbs&nbsp;19:24</a></span> And again: <q>The sluggard folds up his hands, and eats his own flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072602"><a href="../bible/ecc004.htm#verse5">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;4:5</a></span> <q>For every drunkard and whoremonger shall come to poverty, and every drowsy person shall be clothed with tatters <span style="italic">and rags</span> .</q>  And in another passage: <q>If you give your eyes to drinking and cups, you shall afterwards walk more naked than a pestle.</q>  For certainly idleness is the mother of famine. </p>
<h3>That a Bishop Must Be No Accepter of Persons in Judgment; That He Must Possess a Gentle Disposition, and Be Temperate in His Mode of Life.</h3>

<p>V. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be no accepter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; neither revering nor flattering a rich man contrary to what is right, nor overlooking nor domineering over a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man. For, says God to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>You shall not accept the person of the rich, nor shall you pity a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man in his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: for the judgment is the Lord's.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072605"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse15">Leviticus&nbsp;19:15</a>; <a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse3">Exodus&nbsp;23:3</a></span> And again: <q>You shall with exact <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> follow that which is right.</q>  Let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be frugal, and contented with a little in his meat and drink, that he may be ever in a sober frame, and disposed to instruct and admonish the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; and let him not be costly in his diet, a pamperer of himself, given to pleasure, or fond of delicacies. Let him he patient and gentle in his admonitions, well instructed himself, meditating in and diligently studying the Lord's books, and reading them frequently, that so he may be able carefully to interpret the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, expounding the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in correspondence with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and with the law; and let the expositions from the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For the Lord Jesus says: <q>Search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; for they are those which testify of me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072607"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;5:39</a></span> And again: <q>For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wrote of me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072608"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse46">John&nbsp;5:46</a></span> But, above all, let him carefully distinguish between the original law and the additional precepts, and show which are the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and which the bonds for the unbelievers, lest any should fall under those bonds. Be careful, therefore, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to study the word, that you may be able to explain everything exactly, and that you may copiously nourish your people with much doctrine, and enlighten them with the light of the law; for God says: <q>Enlighten yourselves with the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, while we have yet opportunity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072609"><a href="../bible/hos010.htm#verse12">Hosea&nbsp;10:12</a></span> </p>
<h3>That a Bishop Must Not Be Given to Filthy Lucre, Nor Be a Surety Nor an Advocate.</h3>

<p>VI. Let not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be given to filthy lucre, especially before the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, rather suffering than offering injuries; not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, nor rapacious; no purloiner; no admirer of the rich, nor hater of the poor; no evil-speaker, nor false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; not given to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; no brawler; not entangled with the affairs of this life; not a surety for any one, nor an accuser in suits about money; not ambitious; not double-minded, nor double-tongued; not ready to hearken to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> or evil-speaking; not a dissembler; not addicted to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> festivals; not given to vain deceits; not eager after worldly things, nor a lover of money. For all these things are opposite to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and pleasing to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> earnestly give all these precepts in charge to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> also, persuading them to imitate his conduct. For, says He, <q>Make the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072610"><a href="../bible/lev015.htm#verse31">Leviticus&nbsp;15:31</a></span> Let him be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, apt to admonish with the instructions of the Lord, well-disposed, one who has renounced all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> projects of this world, and all heathenish <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>; let hint be orderly, sharp in observing the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and taking heed of them, but yet a friend to all; just, discerning; and whatsoever qualities are commendable among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> possess them in himself. For if the pastor be unblameable as to any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, he will compel his own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and by his very mode of life press them to become worthy imitators of his own actions. As the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> somewhere says, <q>And it will be, as is the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, so is the people;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072611"><a href="../bible/hos004.htm#verse9">Hosea&nbsp;4:9</a></span> for our Lord and Teacher <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <span style="italic">the Son</span>  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, began first to do, and then to teach, <span style="italic">as Luke somewhere</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"> says:</span> <span class="stiki" id="note072613"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;1:1</a></span> <q><span style="italic">which Jesus began</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"> to do and to teach</span> .</q>  Wherefore he says: <q>Whosoever shall do and teach, he shall be called great in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072615"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;5:19</a></span> For you <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are to be guides and watchmen to the people, as you yourselves have Christ for your guide and watchman. Do you therefore become good guides and watchmen to the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the Lord says by Ezekiel, speaking to every one of you: <q><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, I have given you for a watchman to the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and you shall hear the word from my mouth, and shall observe, and shall declare it from me. When I say unto the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, You shall surely die; if you do not speak to warn the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man shall die in his iniquity, and his blood will I require at your hand. But if you warn the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> from his way, that he may turn from it, and he does not turn from it, he shall die in his iniquity, and you have delivered your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  <q>In the same manner, if the sword of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> be approaching, and the people set a watchman to watch, and he see the same approach, and does not forewarn them, and the sword come and take one of them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood shall be required at the watchman's hand, because he did not blow the trumpet. But if he blew the trumpet, and he who heard it would not take warning, and the sword come and take him away, his blood shall be upon him, because he heard the trumpet and took not warning. But he who took warning has delivered his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and the watchman, because he gave warning, shall surely live.</q>  The sword here is the judgment; the trumpet is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; the watchman is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who is set in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by his preaching to testify <span style="italic">and vehemently to forewarn</span>  concerning that judgment. If you do not declare and testify this to the people, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it will be found upon you. Wherefore do you warn and reprove the uninstructed with boldness, teach the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, confirm those that understand, bring back those that go astray. If we repeat the very same things on the same occasions, brethren, we shall not do amiss. For by frequent hearing it is to be hoped that some will be made ashamed, and at least do some good action, and avoid some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one. For says God by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Testify those things to them; perhaps they will hear your voice.</q>  And again: <q>If perhaps they will hear, if perhaps they will submit.</q>  <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also says to the people: <q><span style="italic">If hearing you will hear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, and do that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and right in His eyes</span> .</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072621"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse26">Exodus&nbsp;15:26</a></span> <span style="italic">And again:</span>  <q>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; the Lord our God is one Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072623"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:4</a>; <a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse29">Mark&nbsp;12:29</a></span> And our Lord is often recorded in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to have said: <q>He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</q>  And wise Solomon says: <q>My son, hear the instruction of your father, and reject not the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of your mother.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072625"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse8">Proverbs&nbsp;1:8</a></span> And, indeed, to this day men have not heard; for while they seem to have heard, they have not heard aright, as appears by their having left the one and only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and their being drawn into destructive and dangerous <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, concerning which we shall speak again afterwards. </p>

Beloved, be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you that those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into the death of our Lord Jesus are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to go on no longer in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for as those who are dead cannot work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> any longer, so those who are dead with Christ cannot practice <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. We do not therefore <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, brethren, that any one who has received the washing of life continues in the practice of the licentious acts of transgressors. Now he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> after his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, unless he repent and forsake his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, shall be condemned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a>.  </p>
<h3>Concerning a Person Falsely Accused, or a Person Convicted.</h3>

<p>VIII. But if any one be maliciously prosecuted by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, because he will not still go along with them to the same excess of riot, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that such a one is blessed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according as our Lord says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Blessed are you when men shall reproach you, or <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you, or say all manner of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for your reward is great in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072626"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;5:11-12</a></span> If, therefore, any one be <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accused, such a one is blessed; for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>A man that is a reprobate is not tried by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  But if any one be convicted as having done a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> action, such a one not only hurts himself, but occasions the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its doctrine to be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>; as if we <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> did not practice those things that we declare to be good and honest, and we ourselves shall be reproached by the Lord, that <q>they say and do not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072628"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;23:3</a></span> Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must boldly reject such as these upon full conviction, unless they change their course of life. </p>
<h3>That a Bishop Ought Not to Receive Bribes.</h3>

<p>IX . For the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must not only himself give no offense, but must be no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; in meekness instructing those that offend. But if he himself has not a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and is a respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for the sake of filthy lucre, and receiving of <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>, and spares the open offender, and permits him to continue in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he disregards the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our Lord, which says, <q>You shall exactly execute right judgment.</q>  <q>You shall not accept <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in judgment: you shall not justify the ungodly.</q>  <q>You shall not receive gifts against any one's life; for gifts do blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072631"><a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse8">Exodus&nbsp;23:8</a></span> And elsewhere He says: <q>Take away from among yourselves that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> person.</q>  And Solomon says in his Proverbs: <q>Cast out a pestilent fellow from the congregation, and strife will go out along with him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072633"><a href="../bible/pro022.htm#verse10">Proverbs&nbsp;22:10</a></span> </p>
<h3>That a Bishop Who by Wrong Judgment Spares an Offender is Himself Guilty.</h3>

<p>X . But he who does not consider these things, will, contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, spare him who deserves punishment; as Saul spared Agag,  and Eli  his sons, <q>who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the Lord.</q> Such a one profanes his own dignity, and that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> which is in his parish. Such a one is esteemed <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> before God and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, as affording occasion of scandal to many of the newly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>; as also to the youth of both sexes, to whom a woe belongs, add <q>a mill-stone about his neck,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072636"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;18:6-7</a></span> and drowning, on account of his guilt. For, observing what a person their governor is, through his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and neglect of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> they will grow sceptical, and, indulging the same disease, will be compelled to perish with him; as was the case of the people joining with <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>,  and those which were in the conspiracy with Corah.  But if the offender sees that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> are innocent and unblameable, and the flock pure, he will either not venture to despise their authority, and to enter into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> at all, as one smitten by his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>: or if he values nothing, and ventures to enter in, either he will be convicted immediately, as Uzza  at the ark, when he touched it to support it; and as Achan,  when he stole the accursed thing; and as Gehazi,  when he <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> the money of Naaman, and so will be immediately punished: or else he will be admonished by the pastor, and drawn to repentance. For when he looks round the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> one by one, and can spy no blemish, neither in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> nor in the people who are under his care, he will be put to confusion, and pricked at the heart, and in a peaceable manner will go his way with shame and many tears, and the flock will remain pure. He will apply himself to God with tears, and will repent of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and have hope. Nay, the whole flock, at the sight of his tears, will be instructed, because a sinner avoids destruction by repentance. </p>
<h3>How a Bishop Ought to Judge Offenders.</h3>

<p>XI. Upon this account, therefore, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, endeavour to be pure in your actions, and to adorn your place and dignity, which is that of one sustaining the character of God among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as being set over all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, over <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, kings, rulers, fathers, children, teachers, and in general over all those who are subject to you: and so sit in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> when you speak, as having authority to judge offenders. For to you, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, it is said: <q>Whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072642"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;18:18</a></span>  </p>
<h3>Instruction as to How a Bishop Ought to Behave Himself to the Penitent.</h3>

<p>XII. Therefore, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, judge with authority like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet receive the penitent; for God is a God of mercy. Rebuke those that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, admonish those that are not converted, exhort those that stand to persevere in their goodness, receive the penitent; for the Lord God has promised with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to afford remission to the penitent for what things they have done amiss. For He says by Ezekiel: <q>Speak unto them, As I live, says the Lord, I would not the death of a sinner, but that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> turn from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> way, and live. Turn therefore from your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways; for why will you die, O house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072643"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse11">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:11</a></span> Here <span style="italic">the word</span>  affords hope to sinners, that if they will repent they shall have hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, lest otherwise out of despair they yield themselves up to their transgressions; but that, having hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, they may he converted, and may address to God with tears, on account of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and may repent from their hearts, and so appease His displeasure towards them; so shall they receive a pardon from Him, as from a merciful Father. </p>
<h3>That We Ought to Beware How We Make Trial of Any Sinful Course.</h3>

<p>XIII. Yet it is very necessary that those who are yet innocent should continue so, and not make an experiment what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is, that they may not have occasion for trouble, sorrow, and those lamentations which are in order to forgiveness. For how do you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O man, when you sin, whether you shall live any number of days in this present state, that you may have time to repent? For the time of your departure out of this world is uncertain; and if you die in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there will remain no repentance for you; as God says by David, <q>In the grave who will confess to You?</q>  It behooves us, therefore, to be ready in the doing of our duty, that so we may await our passage into another world without sorrow. Wherefore also the Divine Word exhorts, <span style="italic">speaking to you by the wise Solomon</span>,  <q>Prepare your works against your exit, and provide all beforehand in the field,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072647"><a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse27">Proverbs&nbsp;24:27</a></span> lest some of the things necessary to your journey be wanting; as the oil of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was deficient in the five foolish <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>  mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, when they, on account of their having extinguished their lamps of divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, were shut out of the bride-chamber. Wherefore he who values the security of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will take care to be out of danger, by keeping free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that so he may preserve the advantage of his former good works to himself. Therefore, so judge as executing judgment for God. For, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>the judgment is the Lord's.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072649"><a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy&nbsp;1:17</a></span> In the first place, therefore, condemn the guilty person with authority; afterwards try to bring him home with mercy and compassion, and readiness to receive him, promising him <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> if he will change his course of life, and become a penitent; and when he does repent, and has submitted to his chastisement, receive him: remembering that our Lord has said, <q>There is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in heaven over one sinner that <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072650"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;15:7</a></span> </p>
<h3>Concerning Those Who Affirm that Penitents are Not to Be Received into the Church. That a Righteous Person, Although He Converse with a Sinner, Will Not Perish with Him. That No Person is Punished for Another, But Every One Must Give an Account of Himself. That We Must Assist Those Who are Weak in the Faith; And that a Bishop Must Not Be Governed by Any Turbulent Person Among the Laity.</h3>

<p>XIV. But if you refuse to receive him that repents, you expose him to those who lie in wait to destroy, forgetting what David says: <q>Deliver not my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which confesses to You, unto destroying beasts.</q>  Wherefore Jeremiah, when he is exhorting men to repentance, says thus: <q>Shall not he that falls arise? Or he that turns away, cannot he return? Wherefore have my people gone back by a shameless backsliding? And they are hardened in their purpose. <span class="stiki" id="note072652"><a href="../bible/jer008.htm#verse4">Jeremiah&nbsp;8:4-5</a></span> Turn, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072653"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse22">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:22</a></span> Receive, therefore, without any doubting, him that repents. Be not hindered by such unmerciful men, who say that we must not be defiled with such as those, nor so much as speak to them: for such advice is from men that are unacquainted with God and His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and are unreasonable judges, and unmerciful brutes. These men are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that we ought to avoid society with offenders, not in discourse, but in actions: for <q>the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be upon him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072654"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse20">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:20</a></span> And again: <q>If a land <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against me by trespassing grievously, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of bread upon it, and send famine upon it, and destroy man and beast therein: though these three men, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, Job, and Daniel, were in the midst of it, they shall only save their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by their righteousness, says the Lord God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072655"><a href="../bible/eze014.htm#verse13">Ezekiel&nbsp;14:13-14</a></span> The Scripture most clearly shows that a righteous man that converses with a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man does not perish with him. For in the present world the righteous and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are mingled together in the common affairs of life, but not in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> communion: and in this the friends and favourites of God are guilty of no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For they do but imitate <q>their Farther which is in heaven, who makes His sun to rise on the righteous and unrighteous, and sends His rain on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and on the good;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072656"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> and the righteous man undergoes no peril on this account. For those who conquer and those who are conquered are in the same place of running, but only those who have bravely undergone the race are where the garland is bestowed; and <q>no one is crowned, unless he strive lawfully.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072657"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> For every one shall give account of himself, and God will not destroy the righteous with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; for with Him it is a constant rule, that innocence is never punished. For neither did He drown <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, nor burn up <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, nor destroy Rahab for company. And if you desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how this matter was among us, Judas was one of us, and took the like part of the ministry which we had; and <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon the Magician</a> received the seal of the Lord. Yet both the one and the other proving <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, the former hanged himself, and the latter, as he flew in the air in a manner unnatural, was dashed against the earth. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and his sons with him were in the ark; but Ham, who alone was found <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, received punishment in his son.  But if fathers are not punished for their children, nor children for their fathers, it is thence clear that neither will wives be punished for their husbands, nor servants for their masters, nor one relation for another, nor one friend for another, nor the righteous for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. But every one will be required an account of his own doing. For neither was punishment inflicted on <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> for the world, nor was <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> destroyed by fire for the Sodomites, nor was Rahab slain for the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for the Egyptians. For not the dwelling together, but the agreement in their sentiments, alone could condemn the righteous with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. We ought not therefore to hearken to such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who call for death, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> accusations, and under fair pretences bring men to death. For one man shall not die for another, but <q>every one is held with the chains of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072659"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;5:22</a></span> And, <q>behold, the man and his work is before his face.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072660"><a href="../bible/isa062.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;62:11</a></span> Now we ought to assist those who are with us,  and are in danger, and fall, and, as far as lies in our power, to reduce them to sobriety by our exhortations, and so save them from death. For <q>the whole have no need of the physician, but the sick;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072662"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;9:12</a></span> since <q>it is not pleasing in the sight of your Father that one of these little ones should perish.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072663"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;18:14</a></span> For we ought not to establish the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of hard-hearted men, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the God and Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, which is revealed to us by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>

<p>For it is not equitable that you, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who art the head, should submit to the tail, that is, to some seditious person among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, to the destruction of another, but to God alone. For it is your privilege to govern those under you, but not to be governed by them. For neither does a son, who is subject by the course of generation, govern his father; nor a slave, who is subject by law, govern his master; nor does a scholar govern his teacher, nor a soldier his king, nor any of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. For that there is no reason to suppose that such as converse with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, in order to their instruction in the word, are defiled by or partake of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, Ezekiel, as it were on purpose preventing the suspicions of ill-disposed <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, says thus: <q>Why do you speak this proverb concerning the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge. As I live, says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, you shall not henceforth have occasion to use this proverb in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. For all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are mine, in like manner as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the father, so also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the son is mine: the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it shall die. But the man who is righteous, and does judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a></q> (and so the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> reckons up the rest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and then adds for a conclusion, <q>Such a one is just</q>), <q>he shall surely live, says the Lord God. And if he beget a son who is a robber, a shedder of blood, and walks not in the way of his righteous father</q> (and when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had added what follows, he adds in the conclusion), <q>he shall certainly not live: he has done all this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him. Yet they will ask you, Why? Does not the son bear the iniquity of the father; or his righteousness, having exercised righteousness and mercy himself? And you shall say unto them, The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be upon him.</q>  And a little after he says: <q>When the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, all his righteousness, by reason of all his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> which he has committed, shall not be mentioned to him: in his iniquity which he has committed, and in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, in them shall he die.</q> And a little after he adds: <q>When the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> turns away from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> which he has committed, and does judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, he has preserved his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he has turned away from all his ungodliness which he has done; he shall surely live, he shall not die.</q> And afterwards: <q>I will judge every one of you according to his ways, O house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, says the Lord God.</q> </p>
<h3>That a Priest Must Neither Overlook Offences, Nor Be Rash in Punishing Them.</h3>

<p>XV. Observe, you who are our beloved sons, how merciful yet righteous the Lord our God is; how gracious and kind to men; and yet most certainly <q>He will not acquit the guilty:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072665"><a href="../bible/nah001.htm#verse3">Nahum&nbsp;1:3</a></span> though He welcomes the returning sinner, and revives him, leaving no room for suspicion to such as wish to judge sternly and to reject offenders entirely, and to refuse to vouchsafe to them exhortations which might bring them to repentance. In contradiction to such, God by Isaiah says to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: <q>Comfort, comfort my people, you <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: speak comfortably to Jerusalem.</q> It therefore behooves you, upon hearing those words of His, to encourage those who have offended, and lead them to repentance, and afford them hope, and not vainly to suppose that you shall be partakers of their offenses on account of such your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to them. Receive the penitent with alacrity, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over them, and with mercy and bowels of compassion judge the sinners. For if a person was walking by the side of a river, and ready to stumble, and you should push him and thrust him into the river, instead of offering him your hand for his assistance, you would be guilty of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of your brother; whereas you ought rather to lend your helping hand as he was ready to fall, lest he perish without remedy, that both the people may take warning, and the offender may not utterly perish. It is your duty, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, neither to overlook the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people, nor to reject those who are penitent, that you may not unskilfully destroy the Lord's flock, or dishonour His new name, which is imposed on His people, and you yourself beest reproached as those ancient pastors were, of whom God speaks thus to Jeremiah: <q>Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard; they have polluted my heritage.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072666"><a href="../bible/jer012.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;12:10</a></span> And in another passage: <q>My <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is growing hot against the shepherds, and against the lambs shall I have indignation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072667"><a href="../bible/zec010.htm#verse3">Zechariah&nbsp;10:3</a></span> And elsewhere: <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that dishonour my name.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072668"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse6">Malachi&nbsp;1:6</a></span> </p>
<h3>Of Repentance, the Manner of It, and Rules About It.</h3>

<p>XVI. When you see the offender, with severity command him to be cast out; and as he is going out, let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> also treat him with severity, and then let them go and seek for him, and detain him out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and when they come in, let them entreat you for him. For our Saviour Himself entreated His Father for those who had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Father, forgive them; for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072669"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> Then order the offender to come in; and if upon examination you find that he is penitent, and fit to be received at all into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> when you have afflicted him his days of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, according to the degree of his offense&mdash; as two, three, five, or seven weeks&mdash; so set him at liberty, and speak such things to him as are fit to be said in way of reproof, instruction, and exhortation to a sinner for his reformation, that so he may continue privately in his humility, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to God to be merciful to him, saying: <q>If You, O Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who should stand? For with You there is propitiation.</q>  Of this sort of declaration is that which is said in the book of Genesis to Cain: <q>You have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; be quiet;</q>  that is, do not go on in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For that a sinner ought to be ashamed for his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that oracle of God delivered to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> concerning Miriam is a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that she might be forgiven. For says God to him: <q>If her father had spit in her face, should she not be ashamed? Let her be shut out of the camp seven days, and afterwards let her come in again.</q>  We therefore ought to do so with offenders, when they profess their repentance,&mdash; namely, to separate them some determinate time, according to the proportion of their offense, and afterwards, like fathers to children, receive them again upon their repentance. </p>
<h3>That a Bishop Must Be Unblameable, and a Pattern for Those Who are Under His Charge.</h3>

<p>XVII. But if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself be an offender, how will he be able any longer to prosecute the offense of another? Or how will he be able to reprove another, either he or his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, if by accepting of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or receiving of <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>, they have not all a clear <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>? For when the ruler asks, and the judge receives, judgment is not brought to perfection; but when both are <q>companions of thieves, and regardless of doing <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072673"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse23">Isaiah&nbsp;1:23</a></span> those who are under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> will not be able to support and vindicate him: for they will say to him what is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>Why do you behold the mote that is in your brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in your own eye?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072674"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;6:41</a></span> Let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, therefore, with his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, dread to bear any such thing; that is, let him give no occasion for it. For an offender, when he sees any other doing as bad as himself, will be encouraged to do the very same things; and then the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one, taking occasion from a single instance, works in others, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid: and by that means the flock will be destroyed. For the greater number of offenders there are, the greater is the mischief that is done by them: for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which passes without correction grows worse and worse, and spreads to others; since <q>a little leaven infects the whole lump,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072675"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;5:9</a></span> and one thief spreads the abomination over a whole nation and <q>dead flies spoil the whole pot of sweet ointment;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072676"><a href="../bible/ecc010.htm#verse1">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;10:1</a></span> and <q>when a king hearkens to unrighteous counsel, all the servants under him are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072677"><a href="../bible/pro029.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;29:12</a></span> So one scabbed sheep, if not separated from those that are whole, infects the rest with the same distemper; and a man infected with the plague is to be avoided by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and a mad dog is dangerous to every one that he touches. If, therefore, we neglect to separate the transgressor from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, we shall make the <q>Lord's house a den of thieves.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072678"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;21:13</a></span> For it is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> duty not to be silent in the case of offenders, but to rebuke them, to exhort them, to beat them down, to afflict them with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, that so he may strike a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> dread into the rest: for, as He says, <q>make the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072679"><a href="../bible/lev015.htm#verse31">Leviticus&nbsp;15:31</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be one who discourages <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by his exhortations, and sets a pattern of righteousness, and proclaims those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which are prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and declares that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> which will come at the day of judgment, lest he contemn and neglect the plantation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and, on account of his carelessness, hear that which is said in Hosea: <q>Why have you held your peace at impiety, and have reaped the fruit thereof?</q>  </p>
<h3>That a Bishop Must Take Care that His People Do Not Sin, Considering that He is Set for a Watchman Among Them.</h3>

<p>XVIII. Let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, therefore, extend his concern to all sorts of people: to those who have not offended, that they may continue innocent; to those who offend, that they may repent. For to you does the Lord speak thus: <q>Take heed that you offend not one of these little ones.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072681"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;18:10</a></span> It is your duty also to give remission to the penitent. For as soon as ever one who has offended says, in the sincerity of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the Lord,</q> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> answers, <q>The Lord also has forgiven your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; be of good cheer, you shall not die.</q>  Be sensible, therefore, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, of the dignity of your place, that as you have received the power of binding, so have you also that of loosing. Having therefore the power of loosing, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> yourself, and behave yourself in this world as becomes your place, being aware that you have a great account to give. <q>For to whom,</q> as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>men have entrusted much, of him they will require the more.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072683"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;12:48</a></span> For no one man is free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, excepting Him that was made man for us; since it is written: <q>No man is pure from filthiness; no, not though he be but one day old.</q>  Upon which account the lives and conduct of the ancient <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men and patriarchs are described; not that we may reproach them from our reading, but that we ourselves may repent, and have hope that we also shall obtain forgiveness. For their blemishes are to us both security and admonition, because we hence learn, when we have offended, that if we repent we shall have pardon. For it is written: <q>Who can boast that he has a clean heart? And who dare affirm that he is pure from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072685"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse9">Proverbs&nbsp;20:9</a></span> No man, therefore, is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore labour to the utmost of your power to be unblameable; and be solicitous of all the parts of your flock, lest any one be scandalized on your account, and thereby perish. For the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> is solicitous only for himself, but you for all, as having a greater burden, and carrying a heavier load. For it is written: <q>And the Lord said unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, You and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> shall bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072686"><a href="../bible/num018.htm#verse1">Numbers&nbsp;18:1</a></span> Since, therefore, you are to give an account of all, take care of all. Preserve those that are sound, admonish those that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and when you have afflicted them with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, give them ease by remission; and when with tears the offender begs readmission, receive him, and let the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him; and when by imposition of your hand you have admitted him, give him leave to abide afterwards in the flock. But for the drowsy and the careless, endeavour to convert and confirm, and warn and cure them, as sensible how great a reward you shall have for doing so, and how great danger you will incur if you are negligent therein. For Ezekiel speaks thus to those overseers who take no care of the people: <q>Woe unto the shepherds of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, for they have fed themselves; the shepherds feed not the sheep, but themselves. You eat the milk, and are clothed with the wool; you slay the strong, you do not feed the sheep. The weak you have not strengthened, neither have you healed that which was sick, neither have you bound up that which was broken, neither have you brought again that which was driven away, neither have you sought that which was lost; but, violently you chastised them with insult: and they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became meat to all the beasts of the forest.</q> And again: <q>The shepherds did not search for my sheep; and the shepherds fed themselves, but they fed not my sheep.</q> And a little after: <q>Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my sheep at their hands, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to cease from feeding my sheep, neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; and I will deliver my sheep out of their hands, and they shall not be meat for them.</q> And he also adds, speaking to the people: Behold, I will judge between sheep and sheep, and between rams and rams. Seemed it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, and to have trodden down with your feet the residue of your pasture, and that the sheep have eaten what was trodden down with your feet? And a little after He adds: <q>And you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the Lord, and you the sheep of my pasture; you are my men, and I am your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, says the Lord God.</q>  </p>
<h3>That a Shepherd Who is Careless of His Sheep Will Be Condemned, and that a Sheep Which Will Not Be Led by the Shepherd is to Be Punished.</h3>

<p>XIX . Hear, O you <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and hear, O you of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, how God speaks: <q>I will judge between ram and ram, and between sheep and sheep.</q> And He says to the shepherds: <q>You shall be judged for your unskilfulness, and for destroying the sheep.</q> That is, I will judge between one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and another, and between one lay person and another, and between one ruler and another (for these sheep and these rams are not irrational, but rational creatures): lest at any time a lay person should say, I am a sheep and not a shepherd, and I am not concerned for myself; let the shepherd look to that, for he alone will be required to give an account for me. For as that sheep that will not follow its good shepherd is exposed to the wolves, to its destruction; so that which follows a bad shepherd is also exposed to unavoidable death, since his shepherd will devour him. Wherefore care must be had to avoid destructive shepherds. </p>
<h3>How the Governed are to Obey the Bishops Who are Set Over Them.</h3>

<p>XX . As to a good shepherd, let the lay person <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him, reverence him as his lord, as his master, as the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as a teacher of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. For he that hears him, hears Christ; and he that rejects him, rejects Christ; and he who does not receive Christ, does not receive His God and Father: for, says He, <q>He that hears you, hears me; and he that rejects you, rejects me; and he that rejects me, rejects Him that sent me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072688"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;10:16</a></span> In like manner, let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> as his children, fostering and cherishing them with affectionate diligence; as eggs, in order to the hatching of young ones; or as young ones, taking them in his arms, to the rearing them into birds: admonishing all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; reproving all who stand in need of reproof; reproving, that is, but not striking; beating them down to make them ashamed, but not overthrowing them; warning them in order to their conversion: chiding them in order to their reformation and better course of life; watching the strong, that is, keeping him firm in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> who is already strong; feeding the people peaceably; strengthening the weak, that is, confirming with exhortation that which is tempted; healing that which is sick, that is, curing by instruction that which is weak in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> through doubtfulness of mind; binding up that which is broken, that is, binding up by comfortable admonitions that which is gone astray, or wounded, bruised, or broken by their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and put out of the way; leasing it of its offenses, and giving hope: by this means restore it in strength to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, bringing it back into the flock. Bring again that which is driven away, that is, do not permit that which is in its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and is cast out by way of punishment, to continue excluded; but receiving it, and bringing it back, restore it to the flock, that is, to the people of the undefiled Church. Seek for that which is lost, that is, do not suffer that which desponds of its <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, by reason of the multitude of its offenses, utterly to perish. Search for that which is grown sleepy, drowsy, and sluggish, and that which is unmindful of its own life, through the depth of its sleep, and which is at a great distance from its own flock, so as to be in danger of falling among the wolves, and being devoured by them. Bring it back by admonition, exhort it to be watchful; and insinuate hope, not permitting it to say that which was said by some: <q>Our impieties are upon us, and we pine away in them; how shall we then live?</q>  As far as possible, therefore, let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> make the offense his own, and say to the sinner, Do thou but return, and I will undertake to suffer death for you, as our Lord suffered death for me, and for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For <q>the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep; but he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, that is, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and he leaves the sheep, and flees, and the wolf seizes upon them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072690"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;10:11-12</a></span> We must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, therefore, that God is very merciful to those who have offended, and has promised repentance with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. But he who has offended, and is unacquainted with this promise of God concerning repentance, and does not understand His long-suffering and forbearance, and besides is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, which proclaim repentance, inasmuch as he has never learned them from you, perishes through his folly. But &mdash; like a compassionate shepherd, and a diligent feeder of the flock &mdash; search out, and keep an account of your flock. Seek that which is wanting; <span class="stiki" id="note072691"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;18:12</a></span> as the Lord God our gracious Father has sent His own Son, the good Shepherd and Saviour, our Master Jesus, and has commanded Him to <q>leave the ninety-nine upon the mountains, and to go in search after that which was lost, and when He had found it, to take it upon His shoulders, and to carry it into the flock, rejoicing that He had found that which was lost.</q>  In like manner, be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and seek that which was lost, guide that which has wandered out of the right way, bring back that which is gone astray: for you have authority to bring them back, and to deliver those that are broken-hearted by remission. For by you does our Saviour say to him who is discouraged under the sense of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you: your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has saved you; go in peace.</q>  But this peace and haven of tranquillity is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, into which do you, when you have loosed them from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, restore them, as being now sound and unblameable, of good hope, diligent, laborious in good works. As a skilful and compassionate physician, heal all such as have wandered in the ways of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for <q>they that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.

<h3>That It is a Dangerous Thing to Judge Without Hearing Both Sides, or to Determine of Punishment Against a Person Before He is Convicted.</h3>

<p>XXI. Be gentle, gracious, mild, without guile, without <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>; not rigid, not insolent, not severe, not arrogant, not unmerciful, not puffed up, not a man-pleaser, not timorous, not double-minded, not one that insults over the people that are under you, not one that conceals the divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and the promises to repentance, not hasty in thrusting out and expelling, but steady, not one that delights in severity, not heady. Do not admit less evidence to convict any one than that of three witnesses, and those of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and established <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>; inquire whether they do not accuse out of ill-will or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>: for there are many that delight in mischief, forward in discourse, <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a>, haters of the brethren, making it their business to scatter the sheep of Christ; whose affirmation if you admit without nice scanning the same, you will disperse your flock, and betray it to be devoured by wolves, that is, by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, or rather not men, but wild beasts in the shape of men&mdash; by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and by the atheistic <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For those destroying wolves soon address themselves to any one that is cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and esteem him as a lamb delivered for them to devour, reckoning his destruction their own gain. For he that is <q>their father, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, is a murderer.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072697"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> He also who is separated <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> by your want of care in judging will be overwhelmed with sorrow, and be disconsolate, and so will either wander over to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, or be entangled in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and so will be altogether estranged from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and from hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and will be entangled in impiety, whereby you will be guilty of his perdition: for it is not fair to be too hasty in casting out an offender, but slow in receiving him when he returns; to be forward in cutting off, but unmerciful when he is sorrowful, and ought to be healed. For of such as these speaks the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>: <q>Their feet run to mischief; they are hasty to shed blood. Destruction and misery are in their ways, and the way of peace have they not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God is not before their eyes.</q>  Now the way of peace is our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who has taught us, saying: <q>Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.

As also He instructed us by His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to say unto God: <q>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072700"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> If, therefore, you do not forgive offenders, how can you expect the remission of your own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Do not you rather bind yourselves faster, by pretending in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to forgive, when you really do not forgive? Will you not be confronted with your own words, when you say you forgive and do not forgive? For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he who casts out one who has not behaved himself wickedly, or who will not receive him that returns, is a murderer of his brother, and sheds his blood, as Cain did that of his brother Abel, and his <q>blood cries to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072701"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;4:10</a></span> and will be required. For a righteous man <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> slain by any one will be in rest with God for ever. The same is the case of him who without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is separated by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He who has cast him out as a pestilent fellow when he was innocent, is more <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> than a murderer. Such a one has no regard to the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor is mindful of His goodness to those that are penitent, nor keeping in his eye the examples of those who, having been once great offenders, received forgiveness upon their repentance. Upon which account, he who casts off an innocent person is more cruel than he that murders the body. In like manner, he who does not receive the penitent, scatters the flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, being really against Him. For as God is just in judging of sinners, so is He merciful in receiving them when they return. For David, the man after God's own heart, in his <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> ascribes both mercy and judgment to Him. </p>
<h3>That David, the Ninevites, Hezekiah, and His Son Manasseh, are Eminent Examples of Repentance, the Prayer of Manasseh King of Judah.</h3>

<p>XXII. It is also your duty, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to have before your eyes the examples of those that have gone before, and to apply them skilfully to the cases of those who want words of severity or of consolation. Besides, it is reasonable that in your administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> you should follow the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and as God deals with sinners, and with those who return, that you should act accordingly in your judging. Now, did not God by Nathan reproach David for his offense? And yet as soon as he said he repented, He delivered him from death, saying, <q>Be of good cheer; you shall not die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072702"><a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;12:13</a></span> So also, when God had caused Jonah  to be swallowed up by the sea and the whale, upon his refusal to preach to the Ninevites, when yet he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to Him out of the belly of the whale, He retrieved his life from corruption. And when Hezekiah had been puffed up for a while, yet, as soon as he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with lamentation, He remitted his offense. But, O you <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, hearken to an instance useful upon this occasion. For it is written thus in the fourth book of Kings and the second book of Chronicles: <q>And Hezekiah died; and Manasseh his son reigned. He was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hephzibah. And he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the Lord: he did not abstain from the abominations of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, whom the Lord destroyed from the face of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And Manasseh returned and built the high places which Hezekiah his father had overthrown; and he reared pillars for <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and set up an altar for <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and made groves, as did Ahab king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And he made altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord spoke to David and to Solomon his son, saying, Therein will I put my name. And Manasseh set up altars, and by them served <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and said, My name shall continue for ever.  And he built altars to the <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">host</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in the two courts of the house of the Lord; and he made his children pass through the fire in a place named Ge Benennom;  and he consulted enchanters, and dealt with wizards and familiar spirits, and with conjurers and observers of times, and with teraphim. And he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> exceedingly in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke Him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. And he set a molten and a graven image, the image of his grove, which he made in the house of the Lord, wherein the Lord had chosen to put His name in Jerusalem, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city, for ever, and had said, I will no more remove my foot from the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which I gave to their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the precepts that my servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commanded them. And they hearkened not. And Manasseh seduced them to do more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the Lord than did the nations whom the Lord cast out from the face of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And the Lord spoke concerning Manasseh and concerning His people by the hand of His servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, saying, Because Manasseh king of Judah has done all these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> abominations in a higher degree than the Amorite did which was before him, and has made Judah to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with his <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, thus says the Lord God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, Behold, I bring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever hears of them, both his ears shall tingle. And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will blot out Jerusalem as a table-book is blotted out by wiping it. And I will turn it upside down; and I will give up the remnant of my inheritance, and will deliver them into the hands of their enemies, and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies, because of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which they have done in my eyes, and have provoked me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> from the day that I brought their fathers out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> even until this day. Moreover, Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, beside his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> wherewith he made Judah to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the Lord. And the Lord brought upon him the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, and they caught Manasseh in bonds, and they bound him in fetters of brass, and brought him to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>; and he was bound and shackled with iron all over in the house of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. And bread made of bran was given unto him scantily, and by weight, and water mixed with vinegar but a little and by measure, so much as would keep him alive; and he was in straits and sore affliction. And when he was violently afflicted, he besought the face of the Lord his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and humbled himself greatly before the face of the Lord God of his fathers. And he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> unto the Lord, saying, O Lord, almighty God of our fathers <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed, who has made heaven and earth, with all the ornament thereof, who has bound the sea by the word of Your commandment, who has shut up the deep, and sealed it by Your terrible and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> name, whom all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and tremble before Your power; for the majesty of Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> cannot be borne, and Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> threatening towards sinners is insupportable. But Your merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; for You are <span style="italic">the most high Lord</span>,  of great compassion, long-suffering, very merciful, and repentest of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of men. You, O Lord, according to Your great goodness, have promised repentance and forgiveness to those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against You, and of Your <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> mercy have appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may be saved. You therefore, O Lord, that art the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the just, has not appointed repentance to the just as to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Isaac and Jacob, which have not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against You; but You have appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner: for I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied; my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine iniquity. I am bowed down with many iron bands; for I have provoked Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before You, setting up abominations, and multiplying offenses. Now, therefore, I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching You of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, O Lord, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and I acknowledge mine iniquities; wherefore I humbly beseech You, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquities. Be not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me for ever, by reserving <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for me; neither condemn me into the lower part of the earth. For You are the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of those who repent, and in me You will show Your goodness; for You will save me that am unworthy, according to Your great mercy. Therefore I will praise You for ever all the days of my life; for all the powers of the heavens do praise You, and Yours is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. And the Lord heard his voice, and had compassion upon him. And there appeared a flame of fire about him, and all the iron shackles and chains which were about him fell off; and the Lord healed Manasseh from his affliction, and brought him back to Jerusalem unto his kingdom: and Manasseh <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the Lord He is God alone. And he worshipped the Lord God alone with all his heart, and with all his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, all the days of his life; and he was esteemed righteous. And he took away the strange gods and the graven image out of the house of the Lord, and all the altars which he had built in the house of the Lord, and all the altars in Jerusalem, and he cast them out of the city. And he repaired the altar of the Lord, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> thereon peace-offerings and thank-offerings. And Manasseh spoke to Judah to serve the Lord God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And he slept in peace with his fathers; and Amon his son reigned in his stead. And he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the Lord according to all things that Manasseh his father had done in the former part of his reign. And he provoked the Lord his God to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q>  </p>

<p>You have heard, our beloved children, how the Lord God for a while punished him that was addicted to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and had slain many innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and yet that He received him when he repented, and forgave him his offenses, and restored him to his kingdom. For He not only forgives the penitent, but reinstates them in their former dignity.  </p>
<h3>Amon May be an Example to Such as Sin with an High Hand.</h3>

<p>XXIII. There is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievous than <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, for it is an impiety against God: and yet even this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been forgiven, upon sincere repentance. But if any one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in direct opposition, and on purpose to try whether God will punish the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> or not, such a one shall have no remission, although he say with himself, <q>All is well, and I will walk according to the conversation of my <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> heart.</q> Such a one was Amon the son of Manasseh. For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says: <q>And Amon reasoned an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> reasoning of transgression, and said, My father from his childhood was a great transgressor, and repented in his old age; and now I will walk as my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and afterwards I will return unto the Lord. And he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him. And the Lord God soon destroyed him utterly from His good land. And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house, and he reigned two years only.</q> </p>
<h3>That Christ Jesus Our Lord Came to Save Sinners by Repentance.</h3>

<p>XXIV. Take heed, therefore, you of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, lest any one of you fix the reasoning of Amon in his heart, and be suddenly cut off, and perish. In the same manner, let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> take all the care he can that those which are yet innocent may not fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and let him heal and receive those which turn from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But if he is pitiless, and will not receive the repenting sinner, he will <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the Lord his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, pretending to be more just than God's <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and not receiving him whom He has received, through Christ; for whose sake He sent His Son upon earth to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as a man; for whose sake God was pleased that He, who was the Maker of man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, should be born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; for whose sake He did not spare Him from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, from death, and burial, but permitted Him to die, who by nature could not suffer, His beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, the Angel of His great council, that he might deliver those from death who were obnoxious to death. Him do those provoke to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> who do not receive the penitent. For He was not ashamed of me, Matthew, who had been formerly a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>; and admitted of Peter, when he had through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> denied Him three times, but had appeased Him by repentance, and had wept bitterly; nay, He made him a shepherd to His own lambs. Moreover, He ordained <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, our fellow-apostle, to be of a persecutor an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, and declared him a chosen vessel, even when he had heaped many mischiefs upon us before, and had <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> His sacred name. He says also to another, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that was a sinner: <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are many, are forgiven, for you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> much.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072708"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;7:47</a></span> And when the elders had set another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> which had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before Him, and had left the sentence to Him, and had gone out, our Lord, the Searcher of the hearts, inquiring of her whether the elders had condemned her, and being answered No, He said unto her: <q>Go your way therefore, for neither do I condemn you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072709"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;8:11</a></span> This Jesus, O you <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, our Saviour, our King, and our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ought to be set before you as your pattern; and Him you ought to imitate, in being meek, quiet, compassionate, merciful, peaceable, without passion, apt to teach, and diligent to convert, willing to receive and to comfort; no strikers, not soon <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, not injurious, not arrogant, not supercilious, not wine-bibbers, not drunkards, not vainly expensive, not lovers of delicacies, not extravagant, using the gifts of God not as another's, but as their own, as good stewards appointed over them, as those who will be required by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to give an account of the same. </p>

<h2>Section 4. On the Management of the Resources Collected for the Support of the Clergy, and the Relief of the Poor</h2>

<p>Let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> esteem such food and raiment sufficient as suits necessity and decency. Let him not make use of the Lord's goods as another's, but moderately; <q>for the labourer is worthy of his reward.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072710"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;10:7</a></span> Let him not be luxurious in diet, or fond of idle furniture, but contented with so much alone as is necessary for his sustenance. </p>
<h3>Of First-Fruits and Tithes, and After What Manner the Bishop is Himself to Partake of Them, or to Distribute Them to Others.</h3>

<p>XXV. Let him use those tenths and <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, which are given according to the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as also let him dispense in a right manner the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> offerings which are brought in on account of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, the afflicted, and strangers in distress, as having that God for the examiner of his accounts who has committed the disposition to him. Distribute to all those in want with righteousness, and yourselves use the things which belong to the Lord, but do not abuse them; eating of them, but not eating them all up by yourselves: communicate with those that are in want, and thereby show yourselves unblameable before God. For if you shall consume them by yourselves, you will be reproached by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who says to such unsatiable people, who alone devour all, <q>You eat up the milk, and clothe yourselves with the wool;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072711"><a href="../bible/eze034.htm#verse3">Ezekiel&nbsp;34:3</a></span> and in another passage, <q>Must you alone live upon the earth</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note072712"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;5:8</a></span> Upon which account you are commanded in the law, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072713"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus&nbsp;19:18</a></span> Now we say these things, not as if you might not partake of the fruits of your labours; for it is written, <q>You shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox which treads out the grain;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072714"><a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;25:4</a>; <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:9</a></span> but that you should do it with moderation and righteousness. As, therefore, the ox that labours in the threshing-floor without a muzzle eats indeed, but does not eat all up; so do you who labour in the threshing-floor, that is, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, eat of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: which was also the case of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, who served in the tabernacle of the testimony, which was in all things a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nay, further, its very name implied that that tabernacle was fore-appointed for a testimony of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Here, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> also, who attended upon the tabernacle partook of those things that were offered to God by all the people&mdash;namely, gifts, offerings, and <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and oblations, without disturbance, they and their wives, and their sons and their daughters. Since their employment was the ministration to the tabernacle, therefore they had not any lot or inheritance in the land among the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because the oblations of the people were the lot of Levi, and the inheritance of their tribe. You, therefore, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, are to your people <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, ministering to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> tabernacle, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; who stand at the altar of the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and offer to Him reasonable and unbloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> through Jesus the great High Priest. You are to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, rulers, governors, and kings; the mediators between God and His faithful people, who receive and declare His word, well acquainted with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. You are the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and witnesses of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, who bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all, and intercede for all; whom, as you have heard, the word severely threatens if you hide the key of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from men, who are liable to perdition if you do not declare His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to the people that are under you; who shall have a certain reward from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and unspeakable <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, if you duly minister to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> tabernacle. For as yours is the burden, so you receive as your fruit the supply of food and other necessaries. For you imitate Christ the Lord; and as He <q>bare the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of us all upon the tree</q> at His crucifixion, the innocent for those who deserved punishment, so also you ought to make the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people your own.

As, therefore, you bear the weight, so have you a right to partake of the fruits before others, and to impart to those that are in want, as being to give an account to Him, who without bias will examine your accounts. For those who attend upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to be maintained by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as being <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, presidents, and ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as it is written in the book of Numbers concerning the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: <q>And the Lord said unto <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, You, and your sons, and the house of your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, shall bear the iniquities of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072717"><a href="../bible/num018.htm#verse1">Numbers&nbsp;18:1</a></span> <q>Behold, I have given unto you the charge of the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, from all that are sanctified to me by the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; I have given them for a reward to you, and to your sons after you, by an ordinance for ever.

Hear attentively now what was said formerly: oblations and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> belong to Christ our High Priest, and to those who minister to Him. Tenths of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> are the first letter of the name of Jesus.

<h3>According to What Patterns and Dignity Every Order of the Clergy is Appointed by God.</h3>

<p>XXVI. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he is the minister of the word, the keeper of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the mediator between God and you in the several parts of your divine worship. He is the teacher of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; and, next after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he is your father, who has begotten you again to the adoption of sons by water and the Spirit. He is your ruler and governor; he is your king and potentate; he is, next after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your earthly god, who has a right to be honoured by you. For concerning him, and such as he, it is that God pronounces, <q>I have said, You are gods; and you are all children of the Most High.</q>  And, <q>You shall not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the gods.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072725"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse28">Exodus&nbsp;22:28</a></span> For let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> preside over you as one honoured with the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he is to exercise over the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and by which he is to govern all the people. But let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> minister to him, as Christ does to His Father;  and let him serve him unblameably in all things, as Christ does nothing of Himself, but does always those things that please His Father. Let also the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> be honoured by you in the place of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and not do or say anything without the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>; as neither does the Comforter say or do anything of Himself, but gives <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to Christ by waiting for His pleasure. And as we cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ without the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, so let not any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> address herself to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> without the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a>. Let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> be esteemed by you to represent us the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and let them be the teachers of divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; since our Lord, when He sent us, said, <q>Go and make <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072727"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> Let the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> be esteemed as representing the altar of burnt-offering; and let the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> be honoured as representing the altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> itself. </p>
<h3>That It is a Horrible Thing for a Man to Thrust Himself into Any Sacerdotal Office, as Did Corah and His Company, Saul and Uzziah.</h3>

<p>XXVII. As, therefore, it was not lawful for one of another tribe, that was not a Levite, to offer anything, or to approach the altar without the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, so also do you do nothing without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>;  for if any one does anything without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he does it to no purpose. For it will not be esteemed as of any avail to him. For as Saul, when he had offered without Samuel, was told, <q>It will not avail for you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072729"><a href="../bible/1sa013.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;13:13</a></span> so every person among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, doing anything without the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, labours in vain. And as Uzziah the king,  who was not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and yet would exercise the functions of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, was smitten with <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> for his transgression; so every lay person shall not be unpunished who despises <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is so mad as to affront His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> to snatch that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to himself: not imitating Christ, <q>who <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> not Himself to be made an <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072731"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse5">Hebrews&nbsp;5:5</a></span> but waited till He heard from His Father, <q>The Lord swore, and will not repent, You are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever, after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>.</q>  If, therefore, Christ did not glorify Himself without the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, how dare any man thrust himself into the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> who has not received that dignity from his superior, and do such things which it is lawful only for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to do? Were not the followers of Corah, even though they were of the tribe of Levi, consumed with fire, because they rose up against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and meddled with such things as did not belong to them? And Dathan and Abiram went down quick into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; and the rod that budded put a stop to the readiness of the multitude, and demonstrated who was the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  You ought therefore, brethren, to bring your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and your oblations to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as to your <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, either by yourselves or by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>; and do you bring not those only, but also your <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> offerings to him. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> who they are that are in affliction, and gives to every one as is convenient, that so one may not receive <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> twice or oftener the same day, or the same week, while another has nothing at all. For it is reasonable rather to supply the wants of those who really are in distress, than of those who only appear to be so. </p>
<h3>Of an Entertainment, and After What Manner Each Distinct Order of the Clergy is to Be Treated by Those Who Invite Them to It.</h3>

<p>XXVIII. If any determine to invite elder <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to an entertainment of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, or a feast, as our Saviour calls it, <span class="stiki" id="note072734"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;14:13</a></span> let them most frequently send to such a one whom the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be in distress. But let what is the pastor's due, I mean the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>,  be set apart in the feast for him, even though he be not at the entertainment, as being your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of that God who has entrusted him with the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. But as much as is given to every one of the elder <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, let double so much be given to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Let also a double portion be set apart for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, as for such who labour continually about the word and doctrine, upon the account of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of our Lord, whose place they sustain, as the counsellors of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the crown of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For they are the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> and senate of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. If there be a reader there, let him receive a single portion, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and let the singer and the porter have as much. Let the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, therefore, pay proper honours in their presents, and utmost marks of respect to each distinct order. But let them not on all occasions trouble their governor, but let them signify their desires by those who minister to him, that is, by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, with whom they may be more free. For neither may we address ourselves to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only by Christ. In the same manner, therefore, let the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> all their desires to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and accordingly let them act as he shall direct them. For there was no <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing offered or done in the temple formerly without the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> lips shall keep <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and they shall seek the law at his mouth,</q> as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> somewhere says, <q>for he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072736"><a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse7">Malachi&nbsp;2:7</a></span> For if the worshippers of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, in their hateful, abominable, and impure performances, imitate the sacred rules till this very day (it is a wide comparison indeed, and there is a vast distance between their abominations and God's sacred worship), in their mockeries of worship they neither offer nor do anything without their pretended <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but esteem him as the very mouth of their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of stone, waiting to see what commands he will lay upon them. And whatsoever he commands them, that they do, and without him they do nothing; and they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him, their pretended <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and esteem his name as venerable in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of lifeless <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, and in order to the worship of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits. If these <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, therefore, who give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to lying vanities, and place their hope upon nothing that is firm, endeavour to imitate the sacred rules, how much more reasonable is it that you, who have a most certain <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and undoubted hope, and who expect <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and never-failing promises, should <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Lord God in those set over you, and esteem your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be the mouth of God! </p>
<h3>What is the Dignity of a Bishop and of a Deacon.</h3>

<p>XXIX . For if <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, because he declared to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> the words of God from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, is called a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself is called a god to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, on account of his being at once a king and a <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, as God says to him, <q>I have made you a god to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> your brother shall be your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072737"><a href="../bible/exo007.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;7:1</a></span> why do you not also esteem the mediators of the word to be <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and reverence them as gods? </p>
<h3>After What Manner the Laity are to Be Obedient to the Deacon.</h3>

<p>XXX . For now the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> is to you <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was called a god by the Lord, let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be honoured among you as a god, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> as his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. For as Christ does nothing without His Father, so neither does the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> do anything without his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and as the Son without His Father is nothing, so is the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> nothing without his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and as the Son is subject to His Father, so is every <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> subject to his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and as the Son is the messenger and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so is the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> the messenger and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Wherefore let all things that he is to do with any one be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and be finally ordered by him. </p>
<h3>That the Deacon Must Not Do Anything Without the Bishop.</h3>

<p>XXXI. Let him not do anything at all without his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, nor give anything without his consent. For if he gives to any one as to a person in distress without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he gives it so that it must tend to the reproach of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and he accuses him as careless of the distressed. But he that casts reproach on his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, either by word or deed, opposes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not hearkening to what He says: <q>You shall not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the gods.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072738"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse28">Exodus&nbsp;22:28</a></span> For He did not make that law concerning deities of wood and of stone, which are abominable, because they are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> called gods, but concerning the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the judges, to whom He also said, <q>You are gods, and children of the Most High.</q>  </p>
<h3>That the Deacon Must Not Make Any Distributions Without the Consent of the Bishop, Because that Will Turn to the Reproach of the Bishop.</h3>

<p>XXXII. If therefore, O <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, you know any one to be in distress, put the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in mind of him, and so give to him; but do nothing in a clandestine way, so as may tend to his reproach, lest you raise a murmur against him; for the murmur will not be against him, but against the Lord God: and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, with the rest, will hear what <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and Miriam heard, when they spoke against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>How is it that you were not afraid to speak against my servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072740"><a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse8">Numbers&nbsp;12:8</a></span> And again, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says to those who rose up against him: <q>Your murmuring is not against us, but against the Lord our God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072741"><a href="../bible/exo016.htm#verse8">Exodus&nbsp;16:8</a></span> For if he that calls one of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> Raka, <span class="stiki" id="note072742"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22</a></span> or fool, shall not be unpunished, as doing injury to the name  of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, how dare any man speak against his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, by whom the Lord gave the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> among you upon the laying on of his hands, by whom you have learned the sacred doctrines, and have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by whom you were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom you were sealed with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> and the ointment of understanding, by whom you were declared to be the children of light, by whom the Lord in your illumination testified by the imposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands, and sent out His sacred voice upon every one of you, saying, <q>You are my son, this day have I begotten you?</q>  By your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, O man, God adopts you for His child. Acknowledge, O son, that right hand which was a mother to you. Love him who, after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has become a father to you, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him. </p>
<h3>After What Manner the Bishops are to Be Honoured, and to Be Reverenced as Our Spiritual Parents.</h3>

<p>XXXIII. For if the divine oracle says, concerning our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> according to the flesh, <q>Honour your father and your mother, that it may be well with you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072745"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse12">Exodus&nbsp;20:12</a></span> and, <q>He that curses his father or his mother, let him die the death;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072746"><a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse17">Exodus&nbsp;21:17</a></span> how much more should the word exhort you to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> your spiritual <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them as your benefactors and ambassadors with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who have regenerated you by water, and endued you with the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who have fed you with the word as with milk, who have nourished you with doctrine, who have confirmed you by their admonitions, who have imparted to you the saving body and precious blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who have loosed you from your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, who have made you partakers of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and sacred eucharist, who have admitted you to be partakers and fellow-heirs of the promise of God! Reverence these, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> them with all kinds of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; for they have obtained from God the power of life and death, in their judging of sinners, and condemning them to the death of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, as also of loosing returning sinners from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and of restoring them to a new life. </p>
<h3>That Priests are to Be Preferred Before Rulers and Kings.</h3>

<p>XXXIV. Account these worthy to be esteemed your rulers and your kings, and bring them tribute as to kings; for by you they and their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> ought to be maintained. As Samuel made constitutions for the people concerning a king,  in the first book of Kings, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did so concerning <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in Leviticus, so do we also make constitutions for you concerning <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For if there the multitude distributed the inferior services in proportion to so great a king, ought not therefore the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> much more now to receive of you those things which are determined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the sustenance of himself and of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> belonging to him? But if we may add somewhat further, let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> receive more than the other received of old: for he only managed the affairs of the soldiery, being entrusted with <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and peace for the preservation of men's bodies; but the other is entrusted with the exercise of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order to preserve both body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from dangers. By how much, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more valuable than the body, so much the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office is beyond the kingly. For it binds and looses those that are worthy of punishment or of remission. Wherefore you ought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as your father, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> him as your king, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him as your lord, bringing to him your fruits and the works of your hands, for a blessing upon you, giving to him your <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and your oblations, and your gifts, as to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of your wheat, and wine, and oil, and autumnal fruits, and wool,  and all things which the Lord God gives you. And your offering shall be accepted as a savour of a sweet smell to the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the Lord will bless the works of your hands, and will multiply the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the land. <q>For a blessing is upon the head of him that gives.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072749"><a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse26">Proverbs&nbsp;11:26</a></span> </p>
<h3>That Both the Law and the Gospel Prescribe Offerings.</h3>

<p>XXXV. Now you ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that although the Lord has delivered you from the additional bonds, and has brought you out of them to your refreshment, and does not permit you to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> irrational creatures for sin-offerings, and purifications, and scapegoats, and continual washings and sprinklings, yet has He nowhere freed you from those oblations which you owe to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, nor from doing good to the poor. For the Lord says to you in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Unless your righteousness abound more than that of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, you shall by no means enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072750"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;5:20</a></span> Now herein will your righteousness exceed theirs, if you take greater care of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>; as it is written: <q>He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness remains for ever.</q>  And again: <q>By acts of righteousness and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> iniquities are purged.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072752"><a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse6">Proverbs&nbsp;16:6</a></span> And again: <q>Every bountiful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is blessed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072753"><a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse25">Proverbs&nbsp;11:25</a></span> So therefore shall you do as the Lord has appointed, and shall give to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> what things are due to him, the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of your floor, and of your wine-press, and sin-offerings, as to the mediator between God and such as stand in need of purgation and forgiveness. For it is your duty to give, and his to administer, as being the administrator and disposer of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. Yet shall you not call your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to account, nor watch his administration, how he does it, when, or to whom, or where, or whether he do it well or ill, or indifferently; for he has One who will call him to an account, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, who put this administration into his hands, and thought him worthy of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of so great dignity. </p>
<h3>The Recital of the Ten Commandments, and After What Manner They Do Here Prescribe to Us.</h3>

<p>XXXVI. Have before your eyes the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and always remember the ten commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the one and only Lord God with all your strength; to give no heed to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, or any other beings, as being lifeless gods, or irrational beings or d&aelig;mons. Consider the manifold workmanship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which received its beginning through Christ. You shall observe the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, on account of Him who ceased from His work of creation, but ceased not from His work of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>: it is a rest for meditation of the law, not for idleness of the hands. Reject every unlawful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, everything destructive to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Honour your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, as the authors of your being. Love your neighbour as yourself. Communicate the necessaries of life to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy</a>. Avoid swearing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, and swearing often, and in vain; for you shall not be held guiltless. Do not appear before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> empty, and offer your <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> offerings continually. Moreover, do not leave the church of Christ; but go there in the morning before all your work, and again meet there in the evening, to return thanks to God that He has preserved your life. Be diligent, and constant, and laborious in your calling. Offer to the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> offerings; for says He, <q>Honour the Lord with the fruit of your honest labours.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072754"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse9">Proverbs&nbsp;3:9</a></span> If you are not able to cast anything considerable into the Corban,  yet at least bestow upon the strangers one, or two, or five mites. <q>Lay up to yourself heavenly treasure, which neither the moth nor thieves can destroy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072756"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;6:20</a></span> And in doing this, do not judge your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or any of your neighbours among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>; for if you judge your brother, you become a judge, without being constituted such by anybody, for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are only entrusted with the power of judging. For to them it is said, <q>Judge righteous judgment;</q>  and again <q>Approve yourselves to be exact money-changers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072758"><a href="../bible/zec007.htm#verse9">Zechariah&nbsp;7:9</a></span> For to you this is not entrusted; for, on the contrary, it is said to those who are not of the dignity of magistrates or ministers: <q>Judge not, and you shall not be judged.</q>  </p>

<h2>Section 5. On Accusations, and the Treatment of Accusers</h2>

<h3>Concerning Accusers and False Accusers, and How a Judge is Not Rashly Either to Believe Them or Disbelieve Them, But After an Accurate Examination.</h3>

<p>XXXVII. But it is the duty of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to judge rightly, as it is written, <q>Judge righteous judgment;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072760"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;7:24</a></span> and elsewhere, <q>Why do you not even of yourselves judge what is right?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072761"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse57">Luke&nbsp;12:57</a></span> Be therefore as skilful dealers in money: for as these reject bad money, but take to themselves what is current, in the same manner it is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops's</a> duty to retain the unblameable, but either to heal, or, if they be past cure, to cast off those that are blameworthy, so as not to be hasty in cutting off, nor to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all accusations; for it sometimes happens that some, either through passion or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, do insist on a false accusation against a brother, as did the two elders in the case of Susanna in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>,  and the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the case of Joseph.  Therefore, as a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do not rashly receive such accusations, lest you take away the innocent and slay the righteous; for he that will receive such accusations is the author of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> rather than of peace. But where there is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, there the Lord is not; for that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which is the friend of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>&mdash; I mean that which is excited <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> by the means of false brethren&mdash; never suffers unanimity to be in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Wherefore, when you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to be foolish, quarrelsome, passionate, and such as delight in mischief, do not give credit to them; but observe such as they are, when you hear anything from them against their brother: for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is nothing in their eyes, and they cast a man down in such a way as one would not suspect. Therefore consider diligently the accuser,  wisely observing his mode of life, what, and of what sort it is; and in case you find him a man of veracity, do according to the doctrine of our Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note072765"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;18:15</a></span> and taking him who is accused, rebuke him, that he may repent, when nobody is by. But if he be not persuaded, take with you out or two more, and so show him his fault, and admonish him with mildness and instruction; for <q>wisdom will rest upon an heart that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but is not understood in the heart of the foolish.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072766"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse32">Proverbs&nbsp;14:32</a></span> </p>
<h3>That Sinners are Privately to Be Reproved, and the Penitent to Be Received, According to the Constitution of Our Lord.</h3>

<p>XXXVIII. If, therefore, he be persuaded by the mouth of you three, it is well. But if any one hardens himself, <q>tell it to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: but if he neglects to hear the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let him be to you as an <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> man and a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072767"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;18:17</a></span> and receive him no longer into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but reject him as an <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. But if he be willing to repent, receive him. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not receive an <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> or a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> to communion, before they every one repent of their former impieties; for our Lord Jesus, the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has appointed place for the acceptance of men upon their repentance. </p>
<h3>Examples of Repentance.</h3>

<p>XXXIX . For I Matthew, one of those twelve which speak to you in this doctrine, am an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, having myself been formerly a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, but now have obtained mercy through believing, and have repented of my former practices, and have been vouchsafed the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to be an apostle and preacher of the word. And Zacch&aelig;us, whom the Lord received upon his repentance and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to Him, was also himself in the same manner a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> at first. And, besides, even the soldiers and multitude of <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>, who came to hear the word of the Lord about repentance, heard this from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> John, after he had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> them: <q>Do nothing more than that which is appointed you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072768"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;3:13</a></span> In like manner, life is not refused to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, if they repent and cast away their unbelief. Esteem, therefore, every one that is convicted of any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> action, and has not repented, as a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> or an <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. But if he afterward repents, and turns from his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, then, as we receive the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, when they wish to repent, into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> indeed to hear the word, but do not receive them to communion until they have received the seal of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and are made complete <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; so do we also permit such as these to enter only to hear, until they show the fruit of repentance, that by hearing the word they may not utterly and irrecoverably perish. But let them not be admitted to communion in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and let them depart after the reading of the law, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that by such departure they may be made better in their course of life, by endeavouring to meet every day about the public assemblies, and to be frequent in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that they also may be at length admitted, and that those who behold them may be affected, and be more secured by fearing to fall into the same condition. </p>
<h3>That We are Not to Be Implacable to Him Who Has Once or Twice Offended.</h3>

<p>XL . But yet do not you, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, presently abhor any person who has fallen into one or two offenses, nor shall you exclude him from the word of the Lord, nor reject him from common intercourse, since neither did the Lord refuse to eat with <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners; and when He was accused by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> on this account, He said: <q>They that are well have no need of the physician, but they that are sick.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072769"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;9:12</a></span> Do you, therefore, live and dwell with those who are separated from you for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and take care of them, comforting them, and confirming them, and saying to them: <q>Be strengthened, you weak hands and feeble knees.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072770"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;35:3</a></span> For we ought to comfort those that mourn, and afford encouragement to the fainthearted, lest by immoderate sorrow they degenerate into distraction, since <q>he that is fainthearted is exceedingly distracted.</q>  </p>
<h3>After What Manner We Ought to Receive a Penitent; How We Ought to Deal with Offenders, and When They are to Be Cut Off from the Church.</h3>

<p>XLI. But if any one returns, and shows forth the fruit of repentance, then do you receive him to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as the lost son, the prodigal, who had consumed his father's substance with harlots, who fed swine, and desired to be fed with husks, and could not obtain it. This son, when he repented, and returned to his father, and said, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and before you, and am no more worthy to be called your son;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072772"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;15:21</a></span> the father, full of affection to his child, received him with music, and restored him his old robe, and ring, and shoes, and slew the fatted calf, and made merry with his friends. Therefore, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, act in the same manner. And as you receive an <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> after you have instructed and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> him, so do you let all join in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for this man, and restore him by imposition of hands to his ancient place among the flock, as one purified by repentance; and that imposition of hands shall be to him instead of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: for by the laying on of our hands the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was given to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. And in case some one of those brethren who had stood immoveable accuse you, because you are reconciled to him, say to him: <q>You are always with me, and all that I have is yours. It was meet to make merry and be glad: for this your brother was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.</q> For that God does not only receive the penitent, but restores them to their former dignity, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David is a sufficient <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, who, after his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the matter of Uriah, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said: <q>Restore unto me the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and uphold me with Your free Spirit.</q>  And again: <q>Turn Your face from my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and blot out all mine offenses. Create in me a clean heart, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and renew a right spirit in my inward parts. Cast me not away from Your presence, and take not Your <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from me.</q> Therefore, as a compassionate physician, heal all that have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, making use of saving methods of cure; not only cutting and searing, or using corrosives, but binding up, and putting in tents, and using gentle healing medicines, and sprinkling comfortable words. If it be an hollow wound, or great gash, nourish it with a suitable plaister, that it may be filled up, and become even with the rest of the whole flesh. If it be foul, cleanse it with corrosive powder, that is, with the words of reproof. If it have <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> flesh, eat it down with a sharp plaister&mdash; the threats of judgment. If it spreads further, sear it, and cut off the putrid flesh, mortifying him with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>. But if, after all that you have done, you perceive that from the feet to the head there is no room for a fomentation, or oil, or bandage, but that the malady spreads and prevents all cure, as a gangrene which corrupts the entire member; then, with a great deal of consideration, and the advice of other skilful physicians, cut off the putrefied member, that the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be not corrupted. Be not therefore ready and hasty to cut off, nor do you easily have recourse to the saw, with its many teeth; but first use a lancet to lay open the wound, that the inward <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whence the pain is derived being drawn out, may keep the body free from pain. But if you see any one past repentance, and he has become insensible, then cut off the incurable from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with sorrow and lamentation.

<h3>That a Judge Must Not Be a Respecter of Persons.</h3>

<p>XLII. But if the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> accusation be false, and you that are the pastors, with the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, admit of that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, either by acceptance of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or receiving of <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>, as willing to do that which will he pleasing to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and so you thrust out from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> him that is accused, but is clear of the crime, you shall give an account in the day of the Lord.

<h3>After What Manner False Accusers are to Be Punished.</h3>

<p>XLIII. You shall therefore cast him out of the congregation as a murderer of his brother. Some time afterwards, if he says that he repents, mortify him with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, and afterwards you shall lay your hands upon him and receive him, but still securing him, that he does not disturb anybody a second time. But if, when he is admitted again, he be alike troublesome, and will not cease to disturb and to quarrel with his brother, spying faults out of a contentious spirit, cast him out as a pernicious person, that he may not lay waste the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. For such a one is the raiser of disturbances in cities; for he, though he be within, does not become the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but is a superfluous and vain member, casting a blot, as far as in him lies, on the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For if such men as are born with superfluous members of their body, which hang to them as fingers, or excrescences of flesh, cut them away from themselves on account of their indecency, whereby the unseemliness vanishes, and the man recovers his natural good shape by the means of the surgeon; how much more ought you, the pastors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is a perfect body, and sound members; of such as <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, and in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>), to do the like when there is found in it a superfluous member with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> designs, and rendering the rest of the body unseemly, and disturbing it with sedition, and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and evil-speaking; causing fears, disturbances, blots, evil-speaking, accusations, disorders, and doing the like works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as if he were ordained by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to cast a reproach on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, and mighty disorders, and strife, and division! Such a one, therefore, when he is a second time cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> cut off entirely from the congregation of the Lord. And now the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord will be more beautiful than it was before, when it had a superfluous, and to itself a disagreeable member. Wherefore henceforward it will be free from blame and reproach, and become clear of such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, deceitful, abusive, unmerciful, traitorous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; of such as are <q>haters of those that are good, lovers of pleasure,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072787"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:3-4</a></span> affecters of vainglory, deceivers, and pretenders to wisdom; of such as make it their business to scatter, or rather utterly to disperse, the lambs of the Lord. </p>

<h2>Section 6. The Disputes of the Faithful to Be Settled by the Decisions of the Bishop, and the Faithful to Be Reconciled</h2>

<p>Therefore, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, together with your subordinate <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, endeavour rightly to divide the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For the Lord says: <q>If you walk cross-grained to me, I will walk cross-grained to you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072788"><a href="../bible/lev026.htm#verse27">Leviticus&nbsp;26:27-28</a></span> And elsewhere: <q>With the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> You will be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and with the perfect man You will be perfect, and with the froward You will be froward.</q>  Walk therefore holily, that you may rather appear worthy of praise from the Lord than of complaint from the adversary. </p>
<h3>That the Deacon is to Ease the Burden of the Bishops, and to Order the Smaller Matters Himself.</h3>

<p>XLIV. Be of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, O you <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, one with another, and be at peace with one another; sympathize with one another, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the brethren, and feed the people with care; with one consent teach those that are under you to be of the same sentiments and to be of the same opinions about the same matters, <q>that there may be no schisms among you; that you may be one body and one spirit, perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072790"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:10</a>; <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> according to the appointment of the Lord. And let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> refer all things to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as Christ does to His Father. But let him order such things as he is able by himself, receiving power from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as the Lord did from His Father the power of creation and of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. But the weighty matters let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> judge; but let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> be the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> ear, and eye, and mouth, and heart, and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may not be distracted with many cares, but with such only as are more considerable, as Jethro did appoint for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and his counsel was received.   </p>
<h3>That Contentions and Quarrels are Unbecoming Christians.</h3>

<p>XLV. It is therefore a noble encomium for a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to have no contest with any one;  but if by any management or <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> a contest arises with any one, let him endeavour that it may be composed, though thereby he be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to lose somewhat; and let it not come before an <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> tribunal. Nay, indeed, you are not to permit that the rulers of this world should pass sentence against your people; for by them the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> contrives mischief to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and occasions a reproach to be cast upon us, as though we had not <q>one wise man that is able to judge between his brethren,</q> or to decide their controversies. </p>
<h3>That Believers Ought Not to Go to Law Before Unbelievers; Nor Ought Any Unbeliever to Be Called for a Witness Against Believers.</h3>

<p>XLVI. Let not the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of your differences among one another, nor do you receive unbelievers as witnesses against yourselves, nor be judged by them, nor owe them anything on account of tribute or <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; but <q>render to C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's, and unto God the things that are God's,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072793"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;22:21</a></span> as tribute, taxes, or poll-money, as our Lord by giving a piece of money was freed from disturbance.  Choose therefore rather to suffer harm, and to endeavour after those things that make for peace, not only among the brethren, but also among the unbelievers. For by suffering loss in the affairs of this life, you will be sure not to suffer in the concerns of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and wilt live religiously, and according to the command of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  But if brethren have lawsuits one with another, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid, you who are the rulers ought thence to learn that such as these do not do the work of brethren <span style="italic">in the Lord</span>, but rather of public enemies; and one of the parties will be found to be mild, gentle, and the child of light; but the other unmerciful, insolent, and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>. Let him, therefore, who is condemned be rebuked, let him be separated, let him undergo the punishment of his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to his brother. Afterwards, when he repents, let him be received; and so, when they have learned <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, they will ease your judicatures. It is also a duty to forgive each other's trespasses&mdash; not the duty of those that judge, but of those that have quarrels; as the Lord determined when I Peter asked Him, <q>How oft shall my brother <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against me, and I forgive him? Till seven times?</q> He replied, <q>I say not unto you, Until seven times, but until seventy times seven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072796"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;18:21-22</a></span> For so would our Lord have us to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and never to have anything against anybody; as, for instance, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> without measure, passion without mercy, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> without <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> without reconciliation. Draw by your instruction those who are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> to friendship, and those who are at variance to agreement. For the Lord says: <q>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072797"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;5:9</a></span> </p>
<h3>That the Judicatures of Christians Ought to Be Held on the Second Day of the Week.</h3>

<p>XLVII. Let your judicatures be held on the second day of the week, that if any controversy arise about your sentence, having an interval till the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>,  you may be able to set the controversy right, and to reduce those to peace who have the contests one with another against the Lord's day. Let also the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> be present at your judicatures, to judge without acceptance of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with righteousness. When, therefore, both the parties have come, according as the law says, <span class="stiki" id="note072799"><a href="../bible/deu019.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy&nbsp;19:17</a></span> those that have the controversy shall stand severally in the middle of the court; and when you have heard them, give your votes holily, endeavouring to make them both friends before the sentence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that judgment against the offender may not go abroad into the world; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he has in the court the Christ of God as conscious of and confirming his judgment. But if any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are accused by any one, and their fame suffers as if they did not walk uprightly in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, in like manner you shall hear both parties&mdash; the accuser and accused; but not with prejudice, nor with hearkening to one part only, but with righteousness, as passing a sentence concerning <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life or death. For says God: <q>He shall prosecute that which is right <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072800"><a href="../bible/deu016.htm#verse20">Deuteronomy&nbsp;16:20</a></span> For he that is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> punished and separated by you is rejected from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; he becomes dishonourable among <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, and one condemned of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>
<h3>That the Same Punishment is Not to Be Inflicted for Every Offence, But Different Punishments for Different Offenders.</h3>

<p>XLVIII. Do not pass the same sentence for every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but one suitable to each crime, distinguishing all the several sorts of offenses with much <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, the great from the little. Treat a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> action after one manner, and a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> word after another; a bare intention still otherwise. So also in the case of a contumely or suspicion. And some you shall curb by threatenings alone; some you shall punish with fines to the poor; some you shall mortify with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>; and others you shall separate according to the greatness of their several crimes. For the law did not allot the same punishment to every offense, but had a different regard to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, against the temple, or against the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; from a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the king, or ruler, or a soldier, or a fellow-subject; and so were the offenses different which were against a servant, a possession, or a brute creature. And again, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were differently rated according as they were against <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and kinsmen, and those differently which were done on purpose from those that happened involuntarily. Accordingly the punishments were different: as death either by crucifixion or by <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a>, fines, scourgings, or the suffering the same mischiefs they had done to others. Wherefore do you also allot different penalties to different offenses, lest any <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> should happen, and provoke God to indignation. For of what <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgment soever you are the instruments, of the same you shall receive the reward from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>For with what judgment you judge you shall be judged.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072801"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;7:2</a></span> </p>
<h3>What are to Be the Characters of Accusers and Witnesses.</h3>

<p>XLIX . When, therefore, you are set down at your tribunal, and the parties are both of them present (for we will not call them brethren until they receive each other in peace), examine diligently concerning those who appear before you; and first concerning the accuser, whether this be the first person he has accused, or whether he has advanced accusations against some others before, and whether this contest and accusation of theirs does not arise from some quarrel, and what sort of life the accuser leads. Yet, though he be of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, do not give credit to him alone, for that is contrary to the law; but let him have others to join in his testimony, and those of the same course of life. As the law says: <q>At the mouth of two or three witnesses everything shall be established.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072802"><a href="../bible/deu019.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;19:15</a></span> But why did we say that the character of the witnesses was to be inquired after, of what sort it is? Because it frequently happens that two and more testify for mischief, and with joint consent prefer a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>; as did the two elders against Susanna in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>,  and the sons of transgressors against Naboth in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>,  and the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> against our Lord at Jerusalem,  and against Stephen His first <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.  Let the witnesses therefore be meek, free from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, full of equity, kind, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, continent, free from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, faithful, religious; for the testimony of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is firm on account of their character, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> on account of their mode of life. But as to those of a different character, do not receive their testimony, although they seem to agree together in their evidence against the accused; for it is ordained in the law: <q>You shall not be with a multitude for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; you shall not receive a vain report; you shall not consent with a multitude to pervert judgment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072807"><a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;23:2</a></span> You ought also particularly to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him that is accused; what he is in his course and mode of life; whether he have a good report as to his life; whether he has been unblameable; whether he has been <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; whether he be a lover of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, a lover of the strangers, a lover of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and a lover of the brethren; whether he be not given to filthy lucre; whether he be not an extravagant person, or a spendthrift; whether he be sober, and free from luxury, or a drunkard, or a <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a>; whether he be compassionate and charitable. </p>
<h3>That Former Offences Do Sometimes Render After Accusations Credible.</h3>

<p>L . For if he has been before addicted to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> works, the accusations which are now brought against him will thence in some measure appear to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, unless <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> do plainly plead for him. For it may be, that though he had formerly been an offender, yet that he may not be guilty of this crime of which he is accused. Wherefore be exactly cautious about such circumstances, and so render your sentences, when pronounced against the offender convicted, safe and firm. And if, after his separation, he begs pardon, and falls down before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and acknowledges his fault, receive him. But neither do you suffer a false accuser to go unpunished, that he may not <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> another who lives well, or encourage some other person to do like him. Nor, to be sure, do you allow a person convicted to go off clear, lest another be ensnared in the same crimes. For neither shall a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of mischiefs be unpunished, nor shall he that offends be without censure. </p>
<h3>Against Judging Without Hearing Both Sides.</h3>

<p>LI. We said before that judgment ought not to be given upon hearing only one of the parties; for if you hear one of them when the other is not there, and so cannot make his defence to the accusation brought against him, and rashly give your votes for condemnation, you will be found guilty of that man's destruction, and partaker with the false accuser before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the just Judge. For <q>as he that holds the tail of a dog, so is he that presides at <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072808"><a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse17">Proverbs&nbsp;26:17</a></span> But if you become imitators of the elders in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, who, when they had borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against Susanna, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> condemned her to death, you will become obnoxious to their judgment and condemnation. For the Lord by Daniel delivered Susanna from the hand of the ungodly, but condemned to the fire those elders who were guilty of her blood, and reproaches you by him, saying: <q>Are you so foolish, you children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? Without examination, and without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, have you condemned a daughter of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? Return again to the place of judgment, for these men have borne false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against her.</q>  </p>
<h3>The Caution Observed at Heathen Tribunals Before the Condemnation of Criminals Affords Christians a Good Example.</h3>

<p>LII. Consider even the judicatures of this world, by whose power we see murderers, adulterers, wizards, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> of sepulchres, and thieves brought to trial; and those that preside, when they have received their accusations from those that brought them, ask the malefactor whether those things be so. And though he does not deny the crimes, they do not presently send him out to punishment; but for several days they make inquiry about him with a full council, and with the veil interposed. And he that is to pass the final decree and suffrage of death against him, lifts up his hands to the sun, and solemnly affirms that he is innocent of the blood of the man. Though they be <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the Deity, nor the vengeance which will fall upon men from God on account of those that are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemned, they avoid such <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgments. </p>
<h3>That Christians Ought Not to Be Contentious One with Another.</h3>

<p>LIII. But you who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who our God is, and what are His judgments, how can you bear to pass an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgment, since your sentence will be immediately <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to God? And if you have judged righteously, you will be deemed worthy of the recompenses of righteousness, both now and hereafter; but if unrighteously, you will partake of the like. We therefore advise you, brethren, rather to deserve commendation from God than rebukes; for the commendation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as is His rebuke everlasting death. Be therefore righteous judges, peacemakers, and without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For <q>he that is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is obnoxious to the judgment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072810"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22</a></span> But if it happens that by any one's contrivance you are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at anybody, <q>let not the sun go down upon your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072811"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse26">Ephesians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> for says David, <q>Be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not;</q>  that is, be soon reconciled, lest your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> continue so long that it turn to a settled <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and work <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those that bear a settled <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> are to death,</q>  says Solomon. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>: <q>If you bring your gift to the altar, and there rememberest that your brother has ought against you, leave there your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072814"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;5:23-24</a></span> Now the gift to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is every one's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and thanksgiving. If, therefore, you have anything against your brother, or he has anything against you, neither will your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> be heard, nor will your thanksgivings be accepted, by reason of that hidden <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But it is your duty, brethren, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> continually. Yet, because God hears not those which are at enmity with their brethren by <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> quarrels, even though they should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> three times an hour, it is our duty to compose all our enmity and littleness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that we may be able to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with a pure and unpolluted heart. For the Lord commanded us to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> even our enemies, and by no means to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> our friends. And the lawgiver says: <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> any man; you shall not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> your brother in your mind. You shall certainly reprove your brother, and not incur <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on his account.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072815"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse17">Leviticus&nbsp;19:17</a></span> <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, for you were a sojourner with him.

How oft, therefore, have you remitted to your brother, that you are unwilling to do it now, when you also have heard Jeremiah saying, <q>Do not any of you impute the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of his neighbour in your hearts?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072820"><a href="../bible/zec008.htm#verse17">Zechariah&nbsp;8:17</a></span> But you remember injuries, and keepest enmity, and comest into judgment, and art suspicious of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is hindered. Nay, if you have remitted to your brother four hundred and ninety times, multiply your acts of gentleness still more, to do good for your own sake. Although he does not do so, yet, however, endeavour to forgive your brother for God's sake, <q>that you may be the son of your Father which is in heaven,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072821"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> and when you pray, may be heard as a friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>
<h3>That the Bishops Must by Their Deacon Put the People in Mind of the Obligation They are Under to Live Peaceably Together.</h3>

<p>LIV. Wherefore, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, when you are to go to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> after the lessons, and the psalmody, and the instruction out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> stand near you, and with a loud voice say: Let none have any quarrel with another; let none come in hypocrisy; that if there be any controversy found among any of you, they may be affected in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and be reconciled to their brethren. For if, upon coming into any one's house, we are to say, <q>Peace be to this house,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072822"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;10:12</a></span> like sons of peace bestowing peace on those who are worthy, as it is written, <q>He came and preached peace to you that are near, and those who are far off, whom the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be His,</q>  much more is it incumbent on those that enter into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> before all things to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the peace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for it upon others, much more let himself be within the same, as a child of light; for he that has it not within himself is not fit to bestow it upon others. Wherefore, before all things, it is our duty to be at peace in our own minds; for he that does not find any disorder in himself will not quarrel with another, but will be peaceable, friendly, gathering the Lord's people, and a fellow-worker with him, in order to the increasing the number of those that shall be saved in unanimity. For those who contrive enmities, and strifes, and contests, and lawsuits, are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and aliens from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>
<h3>An Enumeration of the Several Instances of Divine Providence, and How in Every Age from the Beginning of the World God Has Invited All Men to Repentance.</h3>

<p>LV. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being a God of mercy from the beginning, called every generation to repentance by righteous men and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. He instructed those before the flood by Abel and <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Sem</a>, and Seth, also by Enos, and by <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> that was translated; those at the flood by <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>; the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> by hospitable <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>; those after the flood by <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>, and the patriarchs, and Job the beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the Egyptians by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> by him, and Joshua, and Caleb, and Phineas, and the rest; those after the law by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the same by His own <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>  of the Virgin; those a little before His bodily appearance by John His forerunner, and the same by the same person after Christ's birth, saying, <q>Repent, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072825"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;3:2</a></span> those after His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> by us, the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the chosen vessel. We therefore, who have been vouchsafed the favour of being the witnesses of His appearance, together with James the brother of our Lord, and the other seventy-two <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and his seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, have heard from the mouth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and by exact <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> declare <q>what is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that good, and acceptable, and perfect will</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072826"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;12:2</a></span> which is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us by Jesus; that none should perish, but that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with one accord should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, and send unanimously praise to Him, and thereby live for ever. </p>
<h3>That It is the Will of God that Men Should Be of One Mind in Matters of Religion, in Accord with the Heavenly Powers.</h3>

<p>LVI. For this is that which our Lord taught us when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to say to His Father, <q>Your will be done, as in heaven, so upon earth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072827"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;6:10</a></span> that as the heavenly natures of the incorporeal powers do all glorify God with one consent, so also upon earth all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with one mouth and one purpose may glorify the only, the one, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by Christ His only-begotten. It is therefore His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that men should praise Him with unanimity, and adore Him with one consent.  For this is His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that those who are saved by Him may be many; but that you do not occasion any loss or diminution to Him, nor to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or lessen the number by one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as destroyed by you, which might have been saved by repentance; and which therefore perishes not only by its own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also by your treachery besides, whereby you fulfil that which is written, <q>He that gathers not with me, scatters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072829"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;12:30</a></span> Such a one is a disperser of the sheep, an adversary, an enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a destroyer of those lambs whose Shepherd was the Lord, and we were the collectors out of various nations and tongues, by much pains and danger, and perpetual labour, by watchings, by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, by lyings on the ground, by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, by stripes, by imprisonments, that we might do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and fill the feast-chamber with guests to sit down at His table, that is, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, with joyful and chosen people, singing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and praises to God that has called them by us to life. And you, as much as in you lies, have dispersed them. Do you also of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> be at peace with one another, endeavouring like wise men to increase the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to turn back, and tame, and restore those which seem wild.

<h2>Section 7. On Assembling in the Church</h2>

<h3>An Exact Description of a Church and the Clergy, and What Things in Particular Every One is to Do in the Solemn Assemblies of the Clergy and Laity For Religious Worship.</h3>

<p>LVII. But be, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, unblameable, no striker, not soon <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, not cruel; but a builder up, a converter, apt to teach, forbearing of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, of a gentle <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, meek, long-suffering, ready to exhort, ready to comfort, as a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p>When you call an assembly of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as one that is the commander of a great ship, appoint the assemblies to be made with all possible skill, charging the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> as mariners to prepare places for the brethren as for passengers, with all due care and decency. And first, let the building be long, with its head to the east, with its vestries on both sides at the east end, and so it will be like a ship. In the middle let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> throne be placed, and on each side of him let the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a> sit down; and let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> stand near at hand, in close and small girt garments, for they are like the mariners and managers of the ship: with regard to these, let the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> sit on the other side, with all quietness and good order. And let the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> sit by themselves, they also keeping silence. In the middle, let the reader stand upon some high place: let him read the books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, of Joshua the son of Nun, of the Judges, and of the Kings and of the Chronicles, and those written after the return from the captivity; and besides these, the books of Job and of Solomon, and of the sixteen <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. But when there have been two lessons severally read, let some other person sing the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of David, and let the people join at the conclusions of the verses. Afterwards let our Acts be read, and the Epistles of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> our fellow-worker, which he sent to the churches under the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and afterwards let a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> or a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> read the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, both those which I Matthew and John have delivered to you, and those which the fellow-workers of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> received and left to you, Luke and Mark. And while the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is read, let all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and all the people, stand up in great silence; for it is written: <q>Be silent, and hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072831"><a href="../bible/deu027.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy&nbsp;27:9</a></span> And again: <q>But stand there, and hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072832"><a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse31">Deuteronomy&nbsp;5:31</a></span> In the next place, let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> one by one, not all together, exhort the people, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the last place, as being the commander. Let the porters stand at the entries of the men, and observe them. Let the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> also stand at those of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, like shipmen. For the same description and pattern was both in the tabernacle of the testimony and in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  But if any one be found sitting out of his place, let him be rebuked by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, as a manager of the foreship, and be removed into the place proper for him; for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not only like a ship, but also like a sheepfold. For as the shepherds place all the brute creatures distinctly, I mean goats and sheep, according to their kind and age, and still every one runs together, like to his like; so is it to be in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Let the young <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> sit by themselves, if there be a place for them; if not, let them stand upright. But let those that are already stricken in years sit in order. For the children which stand, let their fathers and mothers take them to them. Let the younger <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also sit by themselves, if there be a place for them; but if there be not, let them stand behind the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Let those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> which are married, and have children, be placed by themselves; but let the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and the elder <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, stand or sit before all the rest; and let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> be the disposer of the places, that every one of those that comes in may go to his proper place, and may not sit at the entrance. In like manner, let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> oversee the people, that nobody may whisper, nor slumber, nor laugh, nor nod; for all ought in the church to stand wisely, and soberly, and attentively, having their attention fixed upon the word of the Lord. After this, let all rise up with one consent, and looking towards the east, after the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and penitents are gone out, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to God eastward, who ascended up to the heaven of heavens to the east; remembering also the ancient situation of paradise in the east, from whence the first man, when he had yielded to the persuasion of the serpent, and disobeyed the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was expelled. As to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is over, let some of them attend upon the oblation of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, ministering to the Lord's body with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Let others of them watch the multitude, and keep them silent. But let that <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who is at the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest's</a> hand say to the people, Let no one have any quarrel against another; let no one come in hypocrisy. Then let the men give the men, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> give the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the Lord's <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. But let no one do it with deceit, as Judas betrayed the Lord with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. After this let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for the whole world, and the several parts of it, and the fruits of it; for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the rulers, for the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and the king, and the peace of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. After this let the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for peace upon the people, and bless them, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commanded the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to bless the people, in these words: <q>The Lord bless you, and keep you: the Lord make His face to shine upon you,  and give you peace.</q>  Let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the people, and say: <q>Save Your people, O Lord, and bless Your inheritance, which You have obtained with the precious blood of Your Christ, and hast called a royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation.</q>  After this let the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> follow, the people standing, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> silently; and when the oblation has been made, let every rank by itself partake of the Lord's body and precious blood in order, and approach with reverence and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, as to the body of their king. Let the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> approach with their heads covered, as is becoming the order of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; but let the door be watched, lest any unbeliever, or one not yet initiated, come in.  </p>
<h3>Of Commendatory Letters in Favour of Strangers, Lay Persons, Clergymen, and Bishops; And that Those Who Come into the Church Assemblies are to Be Received Without Regard to Their Quality.</h3>

<p>LVIII. If any brother, man or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, come in from another parish, bringing recommendatory letters, let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> be the judge of that affair, inquiring whether they be of the faithful, and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Whether they be not defiled by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>? And besides, whether the party be a married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> or a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>? And when he is satisfied in these questions, that they are really of the faithful, and of the same sentiments in the things of the Lord, let him conduct every one to the place proper for him. And if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> comes from another parish, let him be received to communion by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>; if a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>; if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, let him sit with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and be allowed the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> with himself; and you, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, shall desire him to speak to the people words of instruction: for the exhortation and admonition of strangers is very acceptable, and exceeding profitable. For, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is accepted in his own country.</q>  You shall also permit him to offer the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>; but if, out of reverence to you, and as a wise man, to preserve the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> belonging to you, he will not offer, at least you shall compel him to give the blessing to the people. But if, after the congregation is sat down, any other person comes upon you of good fashion and character in the world, whether he be a stranger, or one of your own country, neither do you, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, if you are speaking the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or hearing him that sings or reads, accept <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> so far as to leave the ministry of the word, that you may appoint an upper place for him; but continue quiet, not interrupting your discourse, nor your attention. But let the brethren receive him by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>; and if there be not a place, let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> by speaking, but not in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, raise the junior, and place the stranger there. And it is but reasonable that one that loves the brethren should do so of his own accord; but if he refuse, let him raise him up by force, and set him behind all, that the rest may be taught to give place to those that are more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>. Nay, if a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man, or one of a mean <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, or a stranger, comes upon you, whether he be old or young, and there be no place, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> shall find a place for even these, and that with all his heart; that, instead of accepting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> before men, his ministration towards God may be well-pleasing. The very same thing let the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> do to those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, whether poor or rich, that come unto them. </p>
<h3>That Every Christian Ought to Frequent the Church Diligently Both Morning and Evening.</h3>

<p>LIX . When you instruct the people, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, command and exhort them to come constantly to church morning and evening every day, and by no means to forsake it on any account, but to assemble together continually; neither to diminish the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by withdrawing themselves, and causing the body of Christ to be without its member. For it is not only spoken concerning the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but let every one of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> hearken to it as concerning himself, considering that it is said by the Lord: <q>He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072839"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;12:30</a></span> Do not you therefore scatter yourselves abroad, who are the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by not assembling together, since you have Christ your head, according to His promise, present, and communicating to you.  Be not careless of yourselves, neither deprive your Saviour of His own members, neither divide His body nor disperse His members, neither prefer the occasions of this life to the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but assemble yourselves together every day, morning and evening, singing psalms and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in the Lord's house: in the morning saying the sixty-second Psalm, and in the evening the hundred and fortieth, but principally on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>. And on the day of our Lord's resurrection, which is the Lord's day, meet more diligently, sending praise to God that made the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> by Jesus, and sent Him to us, and condescended to let Him suffer, and raised Him from the dead. Otherwise what apology will he make to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who does not assemble on that day to hear the saving word concerning the resurrection, on which we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> thrice standing in memory of Him who arose in three days, in which is performed the reading of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, the oblation of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> food? </p>
<h3>The Vain Zeal Which the Heathens and Jews Show in Frequenting Their Temples and Synagogues is a Proper Example and Motive to Excite Christians to Frequent the Church.</h3>

<p>LX . And how can he be other than an adversary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who takes pains about temporary things night and day, but takes no care of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>? Who takes care of washings and temporary food every day, but does not take care of those that endure for ever? How can such a one even now avoid hearing that word of the Lord, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are justified more than you?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072841"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse52">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:52</a></span> as He says, by way of reproach, to Jerusalem, <q><a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> is justified rather than you.</q> For if the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> every day, when they arise from sleep, run to their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to worship them, and before all their work and all their labours do first of all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to them, and in their feasts and in their solemnities do not keep away, but attend upon them; and not only those upon the place, but those living far distant do the same; and in their public shows all come together, as into a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>: in the same manner those which are vainly called <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when they have worked six days, on the seventh day rest, and come together into their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, never leaving nor neglecting either rest from labour or assembling together, while yet they are deprived of the efficacy of the word in their unbelief, nay, and of the force of that name Judah, by which they call themselves&mdash;for Judah is interpreted <span style="italic">Confession</span>,&mdash; but these do not confess to God (having <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> occasioned the suffering on the cross), so as to be saved on their repentance;&mdash; if, therefore, those who are not saved frequently assemble together for such purposes as do not profit them, what apology will you make to the Lord God who forsakest His Church, not imitating so much as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, but by such your absence growest <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a>, or turnest <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, or actest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? To whom the Lord says by Jeremiah: <q>You have not kept my ordinances; nay, you have not walked according to the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and you have in a manner exceeded them.</q>  And again: <q><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has justified his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> more than treacherous Judah.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072843"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:11</a></span> And afterwards: <q>Will the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> change their gods which are not gods?

<h3>That We Must Not Prefer the Affairs of This Life to Those Which Concern the Worship of God.</h3>

<p>LXI. But if any one allege the pretence of his own work, and so is a despiser, <q>offering pretences for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> let such a one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the trades of the faithful are works by the by, but the worship of God is their great work. Follow therefore your trades as by the by, for your maintenance, but make the worship of God your main business; as also our Lord said: <q>Labour not for the meat which perishes, but for that which endures unto everlasting life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072846"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;6:27</a></span> And again: <q>This is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him whom He has sent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072847"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;6:29</a></span> Endeavour therefore never to leave the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>; but if any one overlooks it, and goes either into a polluted temple of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, or into a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, what apology will such a one make to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the day of judgment, who has forsaken the oracles of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the living and quickening oracles, such as are able to deliver from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, and has gone into an house of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or into a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the murderers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>?&mdash; not hearkening unto him that says: <q>I have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and I will not enter with the ungodly. I have not sat with the assembly of vanity, neither will I sit with the ungodly.</q>  And again: <q>Blessed is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the seat of the scornful; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law will he meditate day and night.</q>  But you, forsaking the gathering together of the faithful, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, hast respect to those <q>dens of thieves,</q> calling those things <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> which He has called profane, and making such things unclean which He has sanctified. And not only so, but you already run after the pomps of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and hasten to their theatres, being desirous to be reckoned one of those that enter into them, and to partake of unseemly, not to say abominable words; not hearkening to Jeremiah, who says, <q>O Lord, I have not sat in their assemblies, for they are scorners; but I was afraid because of Your hand;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072850"><a href="../bible/jer015.htm#verse17">Jeremiah&nbsp;15:17</a></span> nor to Job, who speaks in like manner, <q>If I have gone at any time with the scornful; for I shall be weighed in a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> balance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072851"><a href="../bible/job031.htm#verse5">Job&nbsp;31:5-6</a></span> But why will you be a partaker of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> oracles, which are nothing but dead men declaring by the inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> deadly things, and such as tend to subvert the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to draw those that attend to them to <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>? Do you therefore, who attend to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, esteem those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> than the necessities of this life, and pay a greater respect to them, and run together to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord, <q>which He has purchased with the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the beloved, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature.</q>  For this Church is the daughter of the Highest, which has been in travail of you by the word of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and has <q>formed Christ in you,</q> of whom you are made partakers, and thereby become His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and chosen members, <q>not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but as being <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and unspotted in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, you are complete in Him, after the image of God that created you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072853"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians&nbsp;5:27</a></span> </p>
<h3>That Christians Must Abstain from All the Impious Practices of the Heathens.</h3>

<p>LXII. Take heed, therefore, not to join yourselves in your worship with those that perish, which is the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to your deceit and destruction. For there is no fellowship between God and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; for he that assembles himself with those that favour the things of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, will be esteemed one of them, and will inherit a woe. Avoid also indecent spectacles: I mean the theatres and the pomps of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>; their enchantments, observations of omens, soothsayings, purgations, divinations, observations of birds; their necromancies and invocations. For it is written: <q>There is no <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> in Jacob, nor soothsaying in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072854"><a href="../bible/num023.htm#verse23">Numbers&nbsp;23:23</a></span> And again: <q>Divination is iniquity.</q>  And elsewhere: <q>You shall not be soothsayers, and follow observers of omens, nor <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, nor dealers with familiar spirits.

You are also to avoid their public meetings, and those sports which are celebrated in them. For a believer ought not to go to any of those public meetings, unless to purchase a slave, and save a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  and at the same time to buy such other things as suit their necessities.

<h2>Section 8. On the Duty of Working for a Livelihood</h2>

<h3>That a Christian Who Will Not Work Must Not Eat, as Peter and the Rest of the Apostles Were Fishermen, But Paul and Aquila Tentmakers, Jude the Son of James an Husbandman.</h3>

<p>LXIII. Let the young <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> endeavour to minister diligently in all necessaries: mind your business with all becoming seriousness, that so you may always have sufficient to support yourselves and those that are needy, and not burden the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. For we ourselves, besides our attention to the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, do not neglect our inferior employments. For some of us are fishermen, some tentmakers, some husbandmen, that so we may never be idle. So says Solomon somewhere: <q>Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider her ways diligently, and become wiser than she. For she, having neither field, overseer, nor ruler, prepares her food in the summer, and lays up a great store in the harvest. Or else go to the bee, and learn how laborious she is, and her work how valuable it is, whose labours both kings and mean men make use of for their health. She is desirable and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, though she be weak in strength, yet by honouring wisdom she is improved, etc. How long will you lie on your bed, O sluggard? When will you wake out of your sleep? You sleep awhile, you lie down awhile, you slumber awhile, you fold your hands on your breast to sleep awhile. Then poverty comes on you like an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> traveller, and want as a swift racer. But if you are diligent, your harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall fly from you as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> renegade.</q>  And again: <q>He that manages his own land shall be filled with bread.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072860"><a href="../bible/pro012.htm#verse11">Proverbs&nbsp;12:11</a></span> And elsewhere he says: <q>The <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> has folded his own hands together, and has eaten his own flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072861"><a href="../bible/ecc004.htm#verse5">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;4:5</a></span> And afterwards: <q>The sluggard hides his hand; he will not be able to bring it to his mouth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072862"><a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse24">Proverbs&nbsp;19:24</a></span> And again: <q>By slothfulness of the hands a floor will be brought low.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072863"><a href="../bible/ecc010.htm#verse18">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;10:18</a></span> Labour therefore continually; for the blot of the <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> is not to be healed.
