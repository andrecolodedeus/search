<h1>Apostolic Constitutions (Book III)</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>Section 1. Concerning Widows</h2>

<h3>The Age at Which Widows Should Be Chosen.</h3>

<p>I. Choose your <q><a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> not under sixty years of age,</q>  that in some measure the suspicion of a second marriage may be prevented by their age. But if you admit one younger into the order of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and she cannot bear her widowhood in her youth, and marries, she will procure indecent reflections on the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the order of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and shall give an account to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not because she married a second time, but because she has <q>grown wanton against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072870"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:11</a></span> and not kept her promise, <span style="italic">because she did not come and keep her promise with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>  Wherefore such a promise ought not to be rashly made, but with great caution: <q>for it is better for her not to vow, than to vow and not to pay.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072872"><a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse5">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;5:5</a></span> But if any younger <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who has lived but a while with her husband, and has lost him by death or some other occasion, and remains by herself, having the gift of widowhood, she will be found to be blessed, and to be like the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Sarepta, belonging to Sidon, with whom the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Elijah, <span class="stiki" id="note072873"><a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;17:9</a></span> lodged. Such a one may also be compared to <q>Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser, which departed not from the temple, but continued in supplications and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> night and day, who was fourscore years old, and had lived with an husband seven years from her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, who <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke concerning Him to all those who looked for redemption in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  Such a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> will have a good report, and will be honoured, having both <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with men upon earth, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> praise with God in heaven. </p>
<h3>That We Must Avoid the Choice of Younger Widows, Because of Suspicion.</h3>

<p>II. But let not the younger <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> be placed in the order of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, lest, under pretence of inability to contain in the flower of their age, they come to a second marriage, and become subject to imputation. But let them be assisted and supported, that so they may not, under pretence of being deserted, come to a second marriage, and so be ensnared in an unseemly imputation. For you ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that once marrying according to the law is righteous, as being according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but second marriages, after the promise, are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, not on account of the marriage itself, but because of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. Third marriages are indications of incontinency. But such marriages as are beyond the third are manifest fornication, and unquestionable uncleanness. For God in the creation gave one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to one man; for <q>they two shall be one flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072875"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;2:24</a></span> But to the younger <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> let a second marriage be allowed after the death of their first husband, lest they fall into the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and many snares, and foolish <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, which are hurtful to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and which bring upon them punishment rather than rest. </p>
<h3>What Character the Widows Ought to Be Of, and How They Ought to Be Supported by the Bishop.</h3>

<p>III. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> are those which have had only one husband, having a good report among the generality for good works; <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> indeed, sober, chaste, faithful, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, who have brought up their children well, and have entertained strangers unblameably, which are to be supported as devoted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Besides, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, be mindful of the needy, both reaching out your helping hand and making provision for them as the steward of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, distributing seasonably the oblations to every one of them, to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, the friendless, and those tried with affliction. </p>
<h3>That We Ought to Be Charitable to All Sorts of Persons in Want.</h3>

<p>IV. For what if some are neither <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> nor widowers, but stand in need of assistance, either through poverty or some disease, or the maintenance of a great number of children? It is your duty to oversee all people, and to take care of them all. For they that give gifts do not of their own head give them to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, but barely bring them in, calling them <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> offerings, that so you who <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> those that are in affliction may as a good steward give them their portion of the gift. For God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the giver, though you distribute it to those in want when he is absent. And he has the reward of well-doing, but you have the blessedness of having dispensed it with a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. But tell them who was the giver, that they may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him by name. For it is our duty to do good to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not fondly preferring one or another, whoever they be. For the Lord says: <q>Give to every one that asks of you.</q>  It is evident that it is meant of every one that is really in want, whether he be friend or foe, whether he be a kinsman or a stranger, whether he be single or married. For in all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> the Lord gives us exhortations about the needy, saying first by Isaiah: <q>Deal your bread to the hungry, and bring the poor which have no covering into your house. If you see the naked, cover him; and you shall not overlook those which are of your own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and seed.</q>  And then by Daniel He says to the potentate: <q>Wherefore, O king, let my counsel please you, and purge your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by acts of mercy, and your iniquities by bowels of compassion to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy</a>.</q>  And He says by Solomon: <q>By acts of mercy and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> iniquities are purged.</q>  And He says again by David: <q>Blessed is he that has regard to the poor and needy; the Lord shall deliver him in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> day.</q>  And again: <q>He has dispersed abroad, he has given to the needy, his righteousness remains for ever.</q>  And Solomon says: <q>He that has mercy on the poor lends to the Lord;  according to his gift it shall be repaid him again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072883"><a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse17">Proverbs&nbsp;19:17</a></span> And afterwards: <q>He that stops his ear, that he may not hear him that is in want, he also shall call himself, and there shall be none to hear him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072884"><a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse13">Proverbs&nbsp;21:13</a></span> </p>
<h3>That the Widows are to Be Very Careful of Their Behavior.</h3>

<p>V. Let every <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> be meek, quiet, gentle, sincere, free from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, not talkative, not clamorous, not hasty of speech, not given to evil-speaking, not captious, not double-tongued, not a busybody. If she see or hear anything that is not right, let her be as one that does not see, and as one that does not hear. And let the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> mind nothing but to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for those that give, and for the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and when she is asked anything by any one, let her not easily answer, excepting questions concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and righteousness, and hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, remitting those that desire to be instructed in the doctrines of godliness to the governors. Let her only answer so as may tend to the subversion of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, and let her demonstrate the assertion concerning the monarchy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But of the remaining doctrines let her not answer anything rashly, lest by saying anything unlearnedly she should make the word to be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>. For the Lord has taught us that the word is like <q>a grain of mustard seed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072885"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;13:31</a></span> which is of a fiery nature, which if any one uses unskilfully, he will find it bitter. For in the mystical points we ought not to be rash, but cautious; for the Lord exhorts us, saying: <q>Cast not your pearls before swine, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn again and rend you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072886"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> For unbelievers, when they hear the doctrine concerning Christ not explained as it ought to be, but defectively, and especially that concerning His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> or His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, will rather reject it with scorn, and laugh at it as false, than praise God for it. And so the aged <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> will be guilty of rashness, and of causing <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and will inherit a woe. For says He, <q>Woe to him by whom my name is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072887"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;52:5</a></span> </p>
<h3>That Women Ought Not to Teach, Because It is Unseemly; And What Women Followed Our Lord.</h3>

<p>VI. We do not permit our <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to teach in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072888"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse34">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:34</a></span> but only to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and hear those that teach; for our Master and Lord, Jesus Himself, when He sent us the twelve to make <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the people and of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, did nowhere send out <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to preach, although He did not want such. For there were with us the mother of our Lord and His sisters; also Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Martha and Mary the sisters of Lazarus; Salome, and certain others. For, had it been necessary for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to teach, He Himself had first commanded these also to instruct the people with us. For <q>if the head of the wife be the man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072889"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> it is not reasonable that the rest of the body should govern the head. Let the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> therefore own herself to be the <q>altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and let her sit in her house, and not enter into the houses of the faithful, under any pretence, to receive anything; for the altar of God never runs about, but is fixed in one place. Let, therefore, the virgin and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> be such as do not run about, or wander to the houses of those who are alien from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For such as these are wanderers and impudent: they do not make their feet to rest in one place, because they are not <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, but purses ready to receive, triflers, evil-speakers, counsellors of strife, without shame, impudent, who being such, are not worthy of Him that called them. For they do not come to the common station of the congregation on the Lord's day,  as those that are watchful; but either they slumber, or trifle, or allure men, or beg, or ensnare others, bringing them to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one; not suffering them to be watchful in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, but taking care that they go out as vain as they came in, because they do not hear the word of the Lord either taught or read. For of such as these the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah says: <q>Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and not perceive: for the heart of this people is waxen gross, <span class="stiki" id="note072891"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;6:9-10</a></span> <span style="italic">and they hear heavily with their ears</span> .</q>  </p>
<h3>What are the Characters of Widows Falsely So Called.</h3>

<p>VII. In the same manner, therefore, the ears of the hearts of such <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> as these are stopped, that they will not sit within in their cottages to speak to the Lord, but will run about with the design of getting, and by their foolish prattling fulfil the desires of the adversary. Such <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, therefore, are not affixed to the altar of Christ: for there are some <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> which esteem gain their business; and since they ask without shame, and receive without being satisfied, render the generality more backward in giving. For when they ought to be content with their subsistence from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as having moderate desires, on the contrary, they run from one of their neighbours' houses  to another, and disturb them, heaping up to themselves plenty of money, and lend at bitter <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, and are only solicitous about <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, whose bag is their god; who prefer eating and drinking before all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, saying, <q>Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die;</q>  who esteem these things as if they were durable and not perishing things. For she that uses herself to nothing but talking of money, worships <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> instead of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;that is, is a servant to gain, but cannot be pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor resigned to His worship; not being able to intercede with Him continuously on account that her mind and disposition run after money: for <q>where the treasure is, there will the heart be also.</q>  For she is thinking in her mind whither she may go to receive, or that a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> her friend has forgot her, and she has somewhat to say to her. She that thinks of such things as these will no longer attend to her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, but to that thought which offers itself; so that though sometimes she would <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for anybody, she will not be heard, because she does not offer her petition to the Lord with her whole heart, but with a divided mind. But she that will attend to God will sit within, and mind the things of the Lord day and night, offering her sincere petition with a mouth ready to utter the same without ceasing. As therefore Judith, most famous for her wisdom, and of a good report for her modesty, <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to God night and day for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>;</q>  so also the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who is like to her will offer her intercession without ceasing for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And He will hear her, because her mind is fixed on this thing alone, and is not disposed to be either insatiable, or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, or expensive; when her eye is pure, and her hearing clean, and her hands undefiled, and her feet quiet, and her mouth prepared for neither <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> nor trifling, but speaking the things that are fit, and partaking of only such things as are necessary for her maintenance. So, being grave, and giving no disturbance, she will be pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and as soon as she asks anything, the gift will come to her: as He says, <q>While you are speaking, I will say, Behold, I am here.</q>  Let such a one also be free from the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, free from arrogance, not given to filthy lucre, not insatiable, not gluttonous, but continent, meek, giving nobody disturbance, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, modest, sitting at home, singing, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, and reading, and watching, and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>; speaking to God continually in songs and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. And let her take wool, and rather assist others than herself want from them; being mindful of that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who is honoured in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> with the Lord's testimony, who, coming into the temple, <q>cast into the treasury two mites, which make a farthing. And Christ our Lord and Master, and Searcher of hearts, saw her, and said, Verily I say unto you, that this <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> has cast into the treasury more than they all: for all they have cast in of their abundance, but this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of her penury has cast in all the living that she had.</q>  </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> therefore ought to be grave, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and besides these to the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, reverence, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; not usurping authority, nor desiring to do anything beyond the constitution without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>: as, suppose, the going to any one to eat or drink with him, or to receive anything from anybody. But if without direction she does any one of these things, let her be punished with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, or else let her be separated on account of her rashness. </p>
<h3>That the Widows Ought Not to Accept of Alms from the Unworthy No More Than the Bishop, or Any Other of the Faithful.</h3>

<p>VIII. For how does such a one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of what character the person is from whom she receives? Or from what sort of ministration he supplies her with food, whether it does not arise from rapine or some other ill course of life? While the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> does not remember that if she receives in a way unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, she must give an account for every one of these things. For neither will the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at any time receive a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> offering from such a one, as, suppose, from a rapacious person or from a harlot. For it is written, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> the goods that are your neighbour's;</q>  and, <q>You shall not offer the hire of an harlot to the Lord God.</q>  From such as these no offerings ought to be accepted, nor indeed from those that are separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Let the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> also be ready to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the commands given them by their superiors, and let them do according to the appointment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, being <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to him as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for he that receives from such a one who is worthy of blame, or from one <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for him, while he purposes to go on in a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> course, and while he is not willing at any time to repent, holds communion with him in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and grieves Christ, who rejects the unrighteous, and confirms them by means of the unworthy gift, and is defiled with them, not suffering them to come to repentance, so as to fall down before God with lamentation, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to Him. </p>
<h3>That Women Ought Not to Baptize, Because It is Impious, and Contrary to the Doctrine of Christ.</h3>

<p>IX. Now, as to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, we let you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is no small peril to those that undertake it. Therefore we do not advise you to it; for it is dangerous, or rather <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and impious. For if the <q>man be the head of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q>  and he be originally ordained for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, it is not just to abrogate the order of the creation, and leave the principal to come to the extreme part of the body. For the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the body of the man, taken from his side, and subject to him, from whom she was separated for the procreation of children. For says He, <q>He shall rule over you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072902"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;3:16</a></span> For the principal part of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the man, as being her head. But if in the foregoing constitutions we have not permitted them to teach, how will any one allow them, contrary to nature, to perform the office of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>? For this is one of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> practices of the Gentile <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>, to ordain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to the female deities, not one of the constitutions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> were to be administered by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, certainly our Lord would have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by His own mother, and not by John; or when He sent us to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, He would have sent along with us <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also for this purpose. But now He has nowhere, either by constitution or by writing, delivered to us any such thing; as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the order of nature, and the decency of the action;  as being the Creator of nature, and the Legislator of the constitution. </p>
<h3>That a Layman Ought Not to Do Any Office of the Priesthood: He Ought Neither to Baptize, Nor Offer, Nor Lay on Hands, Nor Give the Blessing.</h3>

<p>X. Neither do we permit the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> to perform any of the offices belonging to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; as, for instance, neither the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>, nor the blessing, whether the smaller or the greater: for <q>no one takes this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to himself, but he that is called of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072904"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;5:4</a></span> For such sacred offices are conferred by the laying on of the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But a person to whom such an office is not committed, but he seizes upon it for himself, he shall undergo the punishment of Uzziah.  </p>
<h3>That None But a Bishop and Presbyter, None Even of the Inferior Ranks of the Clergy, are Permitted to Do the Offices of the Priests; That Ordination Belongs Wholly to the Bishop, and to Nobody Else.</h3>

<p>XI. Nay, further, we do not permit to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>&mdash;as, for instance, neither to readers, nor singers, nor porters, nor ministers,&mdash; but to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> alone, yet so that the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> are to minister to them therein. But those who venture upon it shall undergo the punishment of the companions of Corah. <span class="stiki" id="note072906"><a href="../bible/num016.htm">Numbers&nbsp;xvi</a></span> We do not permit <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> to ordain <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, or readers, or ministers, or singers, or porters, but only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; for this is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order and harmony. </p>
<h3>The Rejection of All Uncharitable Actions.</h3>

<p>XII. Now, as concerning <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, or jealousy, or evil-speaking, or strife, or the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of contention, we have said already to you, that these are alien from a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and chiefly in the case of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. But because the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who works in men, is in his conduct cunning, and full of various devices, he goes to those that are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, as formerly to Cain (for some say they are <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, but do not perform the injunctions agreeable to the widowhood; as neither did Cain discharge the duties due to a brother: for they do not consider how it is not the name of widowhood that will bring them to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>  works). But if any one possesses the name of widowhood, but does the works of the adversary, her widowhood will not be imputed, but she will be thrust out of the kingdom, and delivered to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment. For we hear that some <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> are jealous, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> at the quiet of others. Such <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> as these are not the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor of His doctrine; for it becomes them, when one of their fellow <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> is clothed by any one, or receives money, or meat, or drink, or shoes, at the sight of the refreshment of their sister to say:&mdash; </p>
<h3>How the Widows are to Pray for Those that Supply Their Necessities.</h3>

<p>XIII. You are blessed, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hast refreshed my fellow <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. Bless, O Lord, and glorify him that has bestowed these things upon her, and let his good work ascend in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to You, and remember him for good in the day of his visitation. And as for my <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> &mdash; who <span style="italic">has so well performed his duty to You, and</span>  has ordered such a seasonable <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to be bestowed on my fellow-widow, who was naked &mdash; increase his <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and give him a</span>  crown of rejoicing in the day of the revelation of Your visitation. In the same manner, let the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who has received the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> join with the other in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for him who ministered to her. </p>
<h3>That She Who Has Been Kind to the Poor Ought Not to Make a Stir and Tell Abroad Her Name, According to the Constitution of the Lord.</h3>

<p>XIV. But if any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has been good, let her, as a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> person, conceal her own name, not sounding a trumpet before her, that her <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> may be with God in secret, as the Lord says: <q>You, when you do your <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, let not your left hand <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what your right hand is doing, that your <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> may be in secret.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072910"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;6:3-4</a></span> And let the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him that gave her the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, whosoever he be, as being the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar of Christ;  and <q>the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who sees in secret, will render to him that did good openly.</q> But those <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> which will not live according to the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are solicitous and inquisitive what <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> it is that gives the charity, and what <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> receive it. And when she has learned those things, she murmurs at the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> who distributed the charity, saying, Do you not see that I am in more distress, and want of your charity? Why, therefore, have you preferred her before me? She says these things foolishly, not understanding that this does not depend on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the appointment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if she is herself a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that she was nearer, and, upon inquiry, was in greater want, and more naked than the other, she ought to understand who it is that made this constitution, and to hold her peace, and not to murmur at the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> who distributed the charity, but to enter into her own house, and to cast herself prostrate on her face to make supplication to God that her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be forgiven her. For God commanded the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> who brought the charity not to proclaim the same, and this <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> murmured because she did not publish her name, that so she might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, and run to receive; nay, did not only murmur, but also cursed her, forgetting Him that said: <q>He that blesses you is blessed, and he that curses you is cursed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072912"><a href="../bible/gen027.htm#verse29">Genesis&nbsp;27:29</a></span> But the Lord says: <q>When you enter into an house, say, Peace be to this house. And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if it be not worthy, your peace shall return to you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072913"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;10:5-6</a>; <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;10:12-13</a></span> </p>
<h3>That It Does Not Become Us to Revile Our Neighbours, Because Cursing is Contrary to Christianity.</h3>

<p>XV. If, therefore, peace returns upon those that sent it, nay, upon those that before had actually given it, because it did not find <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> fit to receive it, much rather will a curse return upon the head of him that <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> sent it, because he to whom it was sent was not worthy to receive it: for all those who abuse others without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> curse themselves, as Solomon says: <q>As birds and sparrows fly away, so the curse causeless shall not come upon any one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072914"><a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse2">Proverbs&nbsp;26:2</a></span> And again he says: <q>Those that bring reproaches are exceeding foolish.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072915"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse18">Proverbs&nbsp;10:18</a></span> But as the bee, a creature as to its strength feeble, if she stings any one, loses her sting, and becomes a drone; in the same manner you also, whatsoever <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> you do to others, will bring it upon yourselves. <q>He has graven and dug a pit, and he shall fall into the same ditch that he has made.</q>  And again: <q>He that digs a pit for his neighbour, shall fall into it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072917"><a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse27">Proverbs&nbsp;26:27</a></span> Wherefore he that avoids a curse, let him not curse another; for <q>what you hate should be done to you, do not do to another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072918"><a href="../bible/tob004.htm#verse16">Tobit&nbsp;4:16</a></span> Wherefore admonish the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> that are feeble-minded, strengthen those of those who are weak, and praise such of them as walk in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Let them rather bless, and not <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a>. Let them make peace, and not stir up contention. </p>

<h2>Section 2. On Deacons and Deaconesses, the Rest of the Clergy, and on Baptism</h2>

<p>Let not therefore either a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or any one else of the sacerdotal catalogue, defile his tongue with <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, lest he inherit a curse instead of a blessing; and let it also be the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> business and care that no lay person utter any curse: for he ought to take care of all&mdash;of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. For which reason, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, ordain your fellow-workers, the labourers for life and for righteousness, such <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> as are pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, such whom you prove to be worthy among all the people, and such as shall be ready for the necessities of their ministration. Ordain also a <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> who is faithful and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, for the ministrations towards <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. For sometimes he cannot send a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, on account of unbelievers. You shall therefore send a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a>, on account of the imaginations of the bad. For we stand in need of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a>, for many necessities; and first in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> shall anoint only their forehead with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil, and after him the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> shall anoint them:  for there is no necessity that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> should be seen by the men; but only in the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall anoint her head, as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and kings were formerly anointed, not because those which are now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are ordained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but as being <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, or anointed, from Christ the Anointed, <q>a royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, the pillar and ground of the marriage-chamber,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072920"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:9</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:15</a></span> who formerly were not a people, but now are beloved and chosen, upon whom is called His new name  as Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> witnesses, saying: <q>And they shall call the people by His new name, which the Lord shall name for them.</q>  </p>
<h3>Concerning the Sacred Initiation of Holy Baptism.</h3>

<p>XVI. You therefore, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, according to that type, shall anoint the head of those that are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, whether they be men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil, for a type of the spiritual <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. After that, either you, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> that is under you, shall in the solemn form name over them the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and shall dip them in the water; and let a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> receive the man, and a <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, that so the conferring of this inviolable seal may take place with a becoming decency. And after that, let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> anoint those that are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with ointment. </p>
<h3>What is the Meaning of Baptism into Christ, and on What Account Everything is There Said or Done.</h3>

<p>XVII. This <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, therefore, is given into the death of Jesus:  the water is instead of the burial, and the oil instead of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; the seal instead of the cross; the ointment is the confirmation of the confession; the mention of the Father as of the Author and Sender; the joint mention of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as of the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; the descent into the water the dying together with Christ; the ascent out of the water the rising again with Him. The Father is the God over all; Christ is the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the Comforter, who is sent by Christ, land taught by Him, and proclaims Him. </p>
<h3>Of What Character He Ought to Be Who is Initiated.</h3>

<p>XVIII. But let him that is to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> be free from all iniquity; one that has left off to work <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the heir of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the fellow-heir of His Son; one that has renounced <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> deceits; chaste, pure, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> as a son to his father, and saying, as from the common congregation of the faithful, thus: <q>Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Your name; Your kingdom come; Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven; give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, but deliver us from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one: for Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q>  </p>
<h3>What are the Characters of a Deacon.</h3>

<p>XIX. Let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> be in all things unspotted, as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself is to be, only more active; in number according to the largeness of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that they may minister to the infirm as workmen that are not ashamed. And let the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> be diligent in taking care of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; but both of them ready to carry messages, to travel about, to minister, and to serve, as spoke Isaiah concerning the Lord, saying: <q>To justify the righteous, who serves many faithfully.</q>  Let every one therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his proper place, and discharge it diligently with one consent, with one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the reward of their ministration; but let them not be ashamed to minister to those that are in want, as even our <q>Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> came not to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give His life a ransom for many.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072926"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;20:28</a></span> So therefore ought they also to do, and not to scruple it, if they should be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to lay down their life for a brother. For the Lord and our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> did not scruple to <q>lay down His life,</q> as Himself says, <q>for His friends.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072927"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;15:13</a></span> If, therefore, the Lord of heaven and earth underwent all His sufferings for us, how then do you make a difficulty to minister to such as are in want, who ought to imitate Him who underwent servitude, and want, and stripes, and the cross for us? We ought therefore also to serve the brethren, in imitation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For says He: <q>He that will be great among you, let him be your minister; and he that will be first among you, let him be your servant.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072928"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;20:26-27</a></span> For so did He really, and not in word only, fulfil the prediction of, <q>serving many faithfully.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072929"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;53:11</a></span> For <q>when He had taken a towel, He girded Himself. Afterward He puts water into a bason; and as we were sitting at meat, He came and washed the feet of us all, and wiped them with the towel.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072930"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;13:4-5</a></span> By doing this He demonstrated to us His kindness and brotherly affection, that so we also might do the same to one another. If, therefore, our Lord and Master so humbled Himself, how can you, the labourers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and administrators of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, be ashamed to do the same to such of the brethren as are weak and infirm? Minister therefore with a kind <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not murmuring nor mutinying; for you do not do it on the account of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but on the account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and shall receive from Him the reward of your ministry in the day of your visitation. It is your duty who are <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to visit all those who stand in need of visitation. And tell your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of all those that are in affliction; for you ought to be like his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and senses&mdash; active <span style="italic">and attentive in all things to him</span>  as to your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <span style="italic">and father</span>  and master. </p>
<h3>That a Bishop Ought to Be Ordained by Three or by Two Bishops, But Not by One; For that Would Be Invalid.</h3>

<p>XX. We command that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be ordained by three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or at least by two; but it is not lawful that he be set over you by one; for the testimony of two or three witnesses is more firm and secure. But a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> are to be ordained by one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Nor must either a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> ordain from the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> into the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> is only to teach, to offer, to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, to bless the people, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> is to minister to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, that is, to do the office of a ministering <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, but not to meddle with the other offices. </p>
