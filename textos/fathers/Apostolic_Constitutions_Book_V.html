<h1>Apostolic Constitutions (Book V)</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>Section 1. Concerning the Martyrs</h2>

<h3>That It is Reasonable for the Faithful to Supply the Wants of Those Who are Afflicted for the Sake of Christ by the Unbelievers, According to the Constitution of the Lord.</h3>

<p>I. If any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, on account of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be condemned by the ungodly to the games, to the beasts, or to the mines, do not overlook him; but send to him from your labour and your very sweat for his sustenance, and for a reward to the soldiers, that he may be eased and be taken care of; that, as far as lies in your power, your blessed brother may not be afflicted: for he that is condemned for the name of the Lord God is an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>, the son of the Highest, a receptacle of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by whom every one of the faithful has received the illumination of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, by being vouchsafed the incorruptible crown, and the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sufferings, and the fellowship of His blood, to be made conformable to the death of Christ for the adoption of children. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> do you, all you of the faithful, by your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, minister to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of your substance and of your labour. But if any one has not, let him fast a day, and set apart that, and order it for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. But if any one has superfluities, let him minister more to them according to the proportion of his ability. But if he can possibly sell all his livelihood, and redeem them out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, he will be blessed, and a friend of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For if he that gives his goods to the poor be perfect, supposing his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divine things, much more is he so that does it on account of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. For such a one is worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and will fulfil His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by supplying those who have confessed Him before nations and kings, and the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; concerning whom our Lord declared, saying: <q>Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072972"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;10:32</a></span> And if these be such as to be attested to by Christ before His Father, you ought not to be ashamed to go to them in the prisons. For if you do this, it will be esteemed to you for a testimony, because the real trial was to them a testimony; and your readiness will be so to you, as being partakers of their combat: for the Lord speaks somewhere to such as these, saying: <q>Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an hungry, and you gave me meat; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in; naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and you came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer, and say, Lord, when saw we You an hungered, and fed You? Or thirsty, and gave You drink? When saw we You naked, and clothed You? Or sick, and visited You? When saw we You a stranger, and took You in? Or in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and came unto You? And He will answer and say unto them, Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me. And these shall go away into life everlasting. Then shall He say unto them on His left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For I was hungry, and you gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink; I was a stranger, and you took me not in; naked, and you clothed me not; sick, and in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and you visited me not. Then shall they also answer and say, Lord when saw we You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and did not minister unto You? Then shall He answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as you have not done it unto one of the least of these, neither have you done it unto me. And these shall go away unto everlasting punishment.</q>   </p>
<h3>That We are to Avoid Intercourse with False Brethren When They Continue in Their Wickedness.</h3>

<p>II. But if any one who calls himself a brother is seduced by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one, and acts <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and is convicted and condemned to death as an adulterer, or a murderer, depart from him, that you may be secure, and none of you may be suspected as a partner in such an abominable practice; and that no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report may be spread abroad, as if all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> took a pleasure in unlawful actions. Wherefore keep far from them. But do you assist with all diligence those that for the sake of Christ are abused by the ungodly and shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, or who are given over to death, or bonds, or banishment, in order to deliver your fellow-members from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> hands. And if any one who accompanies with them is caught, and falls into misfortune, he is blessed, because he is partaker with the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and is one that imitates the sufferings of Christ; for we ourselves also, when we oftentimes received stripes from <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, and Alexander, and <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a>, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, <q>went out rejoicing that we were counted worthy to suffer such things for our Saviour.</q>  Do you also <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> when you suffer such things, for you shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in that day.  </p>
<h3>That We Ought to Afford an Helping Hand to Such as are Spoiled for the Sake of Christ, Although We Should Incur Danger Ourselves.</h3>

<p>III. Receive also those that are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and who <q>fly from city to city</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072976"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;10:23</a></span> on account of the Lord's commandment; and assist them as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, rejoicing that you are made partakers of their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that they are esteemed blessed by the Lord; for Himself says: <q>Blessed are you when men shall reproach you, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you, and say all manner of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, because your reward is great in heaven: for so <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> they the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which were before us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072977"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;5:11-12</a></span> And again: <q>If they have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> me, they will also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072978"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;15:20</a></span> And afterwards: <q>If they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you in this city, flee to another. For in the world you have tribulation: for they shall deliver you into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>; and you shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, and for a testimony to them.</q>  And, <q>He that endures unto the end, the same shall be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072980"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;10:22</a></span> For he that is <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in regard to Him, <span style="italic">Christ</span>, and endures, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>
<h3>That It is an Horrible and Destructive Thing to Deny Christ.</h3>

<p>IV. But he that denies himself to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, that he may not be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and so loves his own life more than he does the Lord, in whose hand his breath is, is wretched and miserable, as being detestable and abominable, who desires to be the friend of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but is the enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having no longer his portion with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but with those that are accursed; choosing instead of the kingdom of the blessed, that <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> which is prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: not being any longer <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by men, but rejected by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and cast out from His presence. For of such a one our Lord declared, saying: <q>Whosoever shall deny me before men, and shall be ashamed of my name, I also will deny and be ashamed of him before my Father which is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072981"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;10:33</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;9:26</a></span> And again He speaks thus to us ourselves, His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>He that loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loves son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me. He that finds his life, shall lose it; and he that loses his life for my sake, shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</q>  And afterwards: <q>Fear not those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but rather <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him who is able to destroy both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072983"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;10:28</a></span> </p>
<h3>That We Ought to Imitate Christ in Suffering, and with Zeal to Follow His Patience.</h3>

<p>V. Every one therefore who learns any art, when he sees his master by his diligence and skill perfecting his art, does himself earnestly endeavour to make what he takes in hand like to it. If he is not able, he is not perfected in his work. We therefore who have a Master, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, why do we not follow His doctrine?&mdash; since He renounced repose, pleasure, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, riches, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, the power of revenge, His mother and brethren, nay, and moreover His own life, on account of His <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards His Father, and His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to us the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; and suffered not only <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and stripes, reproach and mockery, but also crucifixion, that He might save the penitent, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. If therefore He for our sakes renounced His repose, was not ashamed of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and did not esteem death inglorious, why do not we imitate His sufferings, and renounce on His account even our own life, with that patience which He gives us? For He did all for our sakes, but we do it for our own sakes: for He does not stand in need of us, but we stand in need of His mercy. He only requires the sincerity and readiness of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says: <q>If you are righteous, what do you give to Him? Or what will He receive at your hand? Your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is to a man like yourself, and your righteousness to a <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>.</q>  </p>
<h3>That a Believer Ought Neither Rashly to Run into Danger Through Security, Nor to Be Over-Timorous Through Pusillanimity, But to Fly Away for Fear; Yet that If He Does Fall into the Enemy's Hand, to Strive Earnestly, Upon Account of the Crown that is Laid Up for Him.</h3>

<p>VI. Let us therefore renounce our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and kinsmen, and friends, and wife, and children, and possessions, and all the enjoyments of life, when any of these things become an impediment to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. For we ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may not enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; but if we be called to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, with constancy to confess His precious name, and if on this account we be punished, let us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, as hastening to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. When we are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, let us not think it strange; let us not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the present world, nor the praises which come from men, nor the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of rulers, according as some of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> wondered at the mighty works of our Lord, yet did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> and the rest of the rulers: <q>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072985"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;12:43</a></span> But now, by confessing a good confession, we not only save ourselves, but we confirm those who are newly illuminated, and strengthen the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. But if we remit any part of our confession, and deny godliness by the faintness of our persuasion, and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of a very short punishment, we not only deprive ourselves of everlasting <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but we shall also become the causes of the perdition of others; and shall suffer double punishment, as affording suspicion, by our denial that that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which we gloried in so much before is an erroneous doctrine. Wherefore neither let us be rash and hasty to thrust ourselves into dangers, for the Lord says: <q>Pray that you fall not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</q>  Nor let us, when we do fall into dangers, be fearful or ashamed of our profession. For if a person, by the denial of his own hope, which is Jesus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, should be delivered from a temporary death, and the next day should fall dangerously sick upon his bed, with a distemper in his bowels, his stomach, or his head, or any of the incurable diseases, as a consumption, or gangrene, or looseness, or iliac passion, or dropsy, or colic, and has a sudden catastrophe, and departs this life; is not he deprived of the things present, and loses those <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>? Or rather, he is within the verge of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, <q>and goes into outer darkness, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072987"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;8:12</a></span> But let him who is vouchsafed the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, as obtaining thereby so great a crown, and departing out of this life by his confession. Nay, though he be but a catechumen, let him depart without trouble; for his suffering for Christ will be to him a more genuine <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, because he does really die with Christ, but the rest only in a figure. Let him therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the imitation of his Master, since is it thus ordained: <q>Let every one be perfect, as his Master is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072988"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse40">Luke&nbsp;6:40</a></span> Now his and our Master, Jesus the Lord, was smitten for our sake: He underwent reproaches and revilings with long-suffering. He was spit upon, He was smitten on the face, He was buffeted; and when He had been scourged, He was nailed to the cross. He had vinegar and gall to drink; and when He had fulfilled all things that were written, He said to His God and Father, <q>Into Your hands I commend my spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072989"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;23:46</a></span> Wherefore let him that desires to be His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> earnestly follow His conflicts: let him imitate His patience, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that, although he be burned in the fire by men, he will suffer nothing, like the three children; <span class="stiki" id="note072990"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm">Daniel&nbsp;iii</a></span> or if he does suffer anything, he shall receive a reward from the Lord, believing in the one and the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and Father, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the great High Priest, and Redeemer of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and rewarder of our sufferings. To whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>
<h3>Several Demonstrations Concerning the Resurrection, Concerning the Sibyl, and What the Stoics Say Concerning the Bird Called the Phoenix.</h3>

<p>VII. For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> Himself will raise us up through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, according to His infallible promise, and grant us a resurrection with all those that have slept from the beginning of the world; and we shall then be such as we now are in our present form, without any defect or corruption. For we shall rise incorruptible: whether we die at sea, or are scattered on the earth, or are torn to pieces by wild beasts and birds, He will raise us by His own power; for the whole world is held together by the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

Or if it had pleased Him in every generation to raise those that died, that this also He was able to do He has made manifest both by Himself and by others; as when He raised the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> son <span class="stiki" id="note072998"><a href="../bible/1ki017.htm">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;xvii</a></span> by Elijah, and the Shunammite's son <span class="stiki" id="note072999"><a href="../bible/2ki004.htm">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;iv</a></span> by Elisha.

Upon this account, therefore, according to the ancient practice, for those who live in the great city, after the combats He brings a dissolution for a while, that, when He raises up every one, He may either reject him or crown him. For He that made the body of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> out of the earth will raise up the bodies of the rest, and that of the first man, after their dissolution, (to pay what is owing to the rational nature of man; we mean the continuance in being through all ages. He, therefore, who brings on the dissolution, will Himself procure the resurrection.

But if the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> laugh at us, and disbelieve our Scriptures, let at least their own prophetess Sibylla  oblige them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, who says thus to them in express words:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But when all things shall be reduced to dust and ashes, <br>And the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> God who kindled the fire shall have quenched it, <br>God shall form those bones and that ashes into a man again, <br>And shall place mortal men again as they were before. <br>And then shall be the judgment, wherein God will do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <br>And judge the world again. But as many mortals as have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> through impiety <br>Shall again be covered under the earth; <br>But so many as have been <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> shall live again in the world.  <br>When God puts His Spirit into them, and gives those at once that are godly both life and favour, <br>Then shall all see themselves.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>If, therefore, this prophetess confesses the resurrection, and does not deny the restoration of all things, and distinguishes the godly from the ungodly, it is in vain for them to deny our doctrine. Nay, indeed, they say they can show a resemblance of the resurrection, while they do not themselves <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the things they declare: for they say that there is a bird single in its kind which affords a copious demonstration of the resurrection, which they say is without a mate, and the only one in the creation. They call it a ph&oelig;nix, and relate that every five hundred years it comes into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to that which is called the altar of the sun, and brings with it a great quantity of cinnamon, and cassia, and balsam-wood, and standing towards the east, as they say, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to the sun, of its own accord is burnt, and becomes dust; but that a worm arises again out of those ashes, and that when the same is warmed it is formed into a new-born phoenix; and when it is able to fly, it goes to Arabia, which is beyond the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> countries. If, therefore, as even themselves say, a resurrection is exhibited by the means of an irrational bird, wherefore do they vainly disparage our accounts, when we profess that He who by His power brings that into being which was not in being before, is able to restore this body, and raise it up again after its dissolution? For on account of this full assurance of hope we undergo stripes, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, and deaths. Otherwise we should to no purpose undergo such things if we had not a full assurance of these promises, whereof we profess ourselves to be the preachers. As, therefore, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> when he says, <q>In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073012"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a></span> and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He did not want matter, but by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> alone brought those things into being which Christ was commanded to make; we mean the heaven, the earth, the sea, the light, the night, the day, the luminaries, the stars, the fowls, the fishes, and four-footed beasts, the creeping things, the plants, and the herbs; so also will He raise all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> up by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as not wanting any assistance. For it is the work of the same power to create the world and to raise the dead. And then He made man, who was not a man before, of different parts, giving to him a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> made out of nothing. But now He will restore the bodies, which have been dissolved, to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are still in being: for the rising again belongs to things laid down, not to things which have no being. He therefore that made the original bodies out of nothing, and fashioned various <span style="italic">forms</span> of them, will also again revive and raise up those that are dead. For He that formed man in the womb out of a little seed, and created in him a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which was not in being before&mdash;as He Himself somewhere speaks to Jeremiah, <q>Before I formed you in the womb I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073013"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:5</a></span> and elsewhere, <q>I am the Lord who established the heaven, and laid the foundations of the earth, and formed the spirit of man in him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073014"><a href="../bible/zec012.htm#verse1">Zechariah&nbsp;12:1</a></span> &mdash; will also raise up all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as being His workmanship; as also the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> testifies that God said to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, His only-begotten, <q>Let us make man after our image, and after our likeness.

And He that raised Himself from the dead, will also raise again all that are laid down. He who raises wheat out of the ground with many stalks from one grain, He who makes the tree that is cut down send forth fresh branches, He that made <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron's</a> dry rod put forth buds,  will raise us up in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; He that raised Him up that had the palsy whole,  and healed him that had the withered hand,  He that supplied a defective part to him that was born blind from clay and spittle,  will raise us up; He that satisfied five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes, and caused a remainder of twelve baskets,  and out of water made wine,  and sent a piece of money out of a fish's mouth  by me Peter to those that demanded tribute, will raise the dead. For we testify all these things concerning Him, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> testify the other.

<h3>An Admonition Instructing Men to Avoid the Abominable Sin of Idolatry.</h3>

<p>XI. You are also forbidden to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by them, or to utter their abominable names through your mouth, and to worship them, or <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them as gods; for they are not gods, but either <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> or the ridiculous contrivances of men.

<h2>Section 3. On Feast Days and Fast Days</h2>

<h3>A Catalogue of the Feasts of the Lord Which are to Be Kept, and When Each of Them Ought to Be Observed.</h3>

<p>XIII. Brethren, observe the festival days; and first of all the birthday which you are to celebrate on the twenty-fifth of the ninth month; after which let the Epiphany be to you the most honoured, in which the Lord made to you a display of His own Godhead, and let it take place on the sixth of the tenth month; after which the fast of Lent is to be observed by you as containing a memorial of our Lord's mode of life and legislation. But let this <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> be observed before the fast of the passover, beginning from the second day of the week, and ending at the day of the preparation. After which solemnities, breaking off your fast, begin the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> week of the passover, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> in the same all of you with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in them for those that are about to perish. </p>
<h3>Concerning the Passion of Our Lord, and What Was Done on Each Day of His Sufferings; And Concerning Judas, and that Judas Was Not Present When the Lord Delivered the Mysteries to His Disciples.</h3>

<p>XIV. For they began to hold a council against the Lord on the second day of the week, in the first month, which is Xanthicus; and the deliberation continued on the third day of the week; but on the fourth day they determined to take away His life by crucifixion. And Judas <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, who for a long time had been perverted, but was then smitten by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself with the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, although he had been long entrusted with the purse, <span class="stiki" id="note073059"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;12:6</a></span> and used to steal what was set apart for the needy, yet was he not cast off by the Lord, through much long-suffering; nay, and when we were once feasting with Him, being willing both to reduce him to his duty and instruct us in His own foreknowledge, He said: <q>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you will betray me;</q> and every one of us saying, <q>Is it I?</q>  And the Lord being silent, I, who was one of the twelve, and more beloved by Him than the rest, arose up from lying in His bosom, and besought Him to tell who it should be that should betray Him. Yet neither then did our good Lord declare His name, but gave two signs of the betrayer: one by saying, <q>he that dips with me in the dish;</q> a second, <q>to whom I shall give the sop when I have dipped it.</q> Nay, although he himself said, <q>Master, is it I?</q> the Lord did not say Yes, but, <q>You have said.</q> And being willing to affright him in the matter, He said: <q>Woe to that man by whom the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is betrayed! good were it for him if he had never been born. Who, when he had heard that, went his way, and said to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, What will you give me, and I will deliver Him unto you? And they bargained with him for thirty pieces of silver.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073061"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;26:15</a></span> And the scripture was fulfilled, which said, <q>And they took  the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that was valued, whom they of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> did value, and gave them for the house of the potter.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073063"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;27:9-10</a></span> And on the fifth day of the week, when we had eaten the passover with Him, and when Judas had dipped his hand into the dish, and received the sop, and had gone out by night, the Lord said to us: <q>The hour has come that you shall be dispersed, and shall leave me alone;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073064"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse32">John&nbsp;16:32</a>; <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;26:31</a></span> and every one vehemently affirming that they would not forsake Him, I Peter adding this promise, that I would even die with Him, He said, <q>Verily I say unto you, Before the cock crows, you shall thrice deny that you know me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073065"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;22:34</a></span> And when He had delivered to us the representative <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of His precious body and blood, Judas not being present with us, He went out to the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a>, near the brook Cedron, where there was a garden; <span class="stiki" id="note073066"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;18:1</a></span> and we were with Him, and sang an hymn according to the custom. <span class="stiki" id="note073067"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;26:30</a></span> And being separated not far  from us, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to His Father, saying: <q>Father, remove this cup away from me; yet not my will, but Yours be done.</q>  And when He had done this thrice, while we out of despondency of mind were fallen asleep, He came and said: <q>The hour has come, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is betrayed into the hands of sinners. And behold Judas, and with him a multitude of ungodly men,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073070"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;22:47</a>; <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse47">Matthew&nbsp;26:47</a></span> to whom he shows the signal by which he was to betray Him&mdash; a deceitful <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. But they, when they had received the signal agreed on, took hold of the Lord; and having bound Him, they led Him to the house of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, wherein were assembled many, not the people, but a great rout, not an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council, but an assembly of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and council of the ungodly, who did many things against Him, and left no kind of injury untried, spitting upon Him, cavilling at Him, beating Him, smiting Him on the face, reviling Him, tempting Him, seeking vain <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> instead of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> prophecies from Him, calling Him a deceiver, a blasphemer, a transgressor of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, a destroyer of the temple, a taker away of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, an enemy to the Romans, an adversary to C&aelig;sar. And these reproaches did these bulls and dogs  in their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> cast upon Him, till it was very early in the morning, and then they lead Him away to <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a>, who was father-in-law to <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>; and when they had done the like things to Him there, it being the day of the preparation, they delivered Him to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> the Roman governor, accusing Him of many and great things, none of which they could prove. Whereupon the governor, as out of patience with them, said: <q>I find no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> against Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073072"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;23:14</a>; <a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;18:38</a></span> But they bringing two lying witnesses, wished to accuse the Lord <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>; but they being found to disagree, and so their testimony not conspiring together, they altered the accusation to that of treason, saying, <q>This fellow says that He is a king, and forbids to give tribute to C&aelig;sar.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073073"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;23:2</a></span> And themselves became accusers, and witnesses, and judges, and authors of the sentence, saying, <q>Crucify Him, crucify Him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073074"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;23:21</a></span> that it might be fulfilled which is written by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> concerning Him, <q>Unjust witnesses were gathered together against me, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> lied to itself;</q>  and again, <q>Many dogs compassed me about, the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> laid siege against me;</q>  and elsewhere, <q>My inheritance became to me as a lion in a wood, and has sent forth her voice against me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073077"><a href="../bible/jer012.htm#verse8">Jeremiah&nbsp;12:8</a></span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore, disgracing his authority by his pusillanimity, convicts himself of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> by regarding the multitude more than this just person, and bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Him that He was innocent, yet as guilty delivering Him up to the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, although the Romans had made <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that no man unconvicted should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. But the executioners took the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and nailed Him to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, crucifying Him indeed at the sixth hour, but having received the sentence of His condemnation at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>. After this they gave to Him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall. Then they divided His garments by lot. Then they crucified two malefactors with Him, on each side one, that it might be fulfilled which was written: <q>They gave me gall to eat, and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.</q>  And again: <q>They divided my garment among themselves, and upon my vesture have they cast lots.</q>  And in another place: <q>And I was reckoned with the transgressors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073080"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;53:12</a></span> Then there was darkness for three hours, from the sixth to the ninth, and again light in the evening; as it is written: <q>It shall not be day nor night, and at the evening there shall be light.</q>  All which things,  when those malefactors saw that were crucified with Him, the one of them reproached Him as though He was weak and unable to deliver Himself; but the other rebuked the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of his fellow and turning to the Lord, as being enlightened by Him, and acknowledging who He was that suffered, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that He would remember him in His kingdom hereafter.  He then presently granted him the forgiveness of his former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and brought him into paradise to enjoy the mystical <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; who also cried out about the ninth hour, and said to His Father: <q>My God! My God! Why have You forsaken me?</q>  And a little afterward, when He had cried with a loud voice, <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do,</q>  and had added, <q>Into Your hands I commit my spirit,</q> He gave up the ghost,  and was buried before sunset in a new sepulchre. But when the first day of the week dawned He arose from the dead, and fulfilled those things which before His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> He foretold to us, saying: <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must continue in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.</q>  And when He was risen from the dead, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, then to Cleopas in the way, and after that to us His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who had fled away for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but privately were very inquisitive about Him.  But these things are also written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. </p>
<h3>Of the Great Week, and on What Account They Enjoin Us to Fast on Wednesday and Friday.</h3>

<p>XV. He therefore charged us Himself to fast these six days on account of the impiety and transgression of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, commanding us withal to bewail over them, and lament for their perdition. For even He Himself <q>wept over them, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the time of their visitation.</q>  But He commanded us to fast on the fourth and sixth days of the week; the former on account of His being betrayed, and the latter on account of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>. But He appointed us to break our fast on the seventh day at the cock-crowing, but to fast on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>. Not that the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> is a day of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, being the rest from the creation, but because we ought to fast on this one <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> only, while on this day the Creator was under the earth. For on their very feast-day they apprehended the Lord, that oracle might be fulfilled which says: <q>They placed their signs in the middle of their feast, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them not.</q>  You ought therefore to bewail over them, because when the Lord came they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, but rejected His doctrine, judging themselves unworthy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. You therefore are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who once were not a people, but are now an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, delivered from the deceit of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, from impiety, who once had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy through your hearty <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>: for to you, the converted <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, is opened the gate of life, who formerly were not beloved, but are now beloved; a people ordained for the possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to show forth His <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, concerning whom our Saviour said, <q>I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not after me. I said, Behold me, to a nation which did not call upon my name.</q>  For when you did not seek after Him, then were you sought for by Him; and you who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him have hearkened to His call, and have left the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, and have fled to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> monarchy, to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through Christ Jesus, and have become the completion of the number of the saved&mdash; <q>ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073092"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse10">Daniel&nbsp;7:10</a></span> as it is written in David, <q>A thousand  shall fall beside you, and ten thousand at your right hand;</q>  and again, <q>The chariots of God are by tens of thousands, and thousands of the prosperous.</q>  But unto unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> He says: <q>All the day long have I stretched out mine hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people, which go in a way that is not good, but after their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, a people provoking me before my face.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073096"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;65:2</a></span> </p>
<h3>An Enumeration of the Prophetical Predictions Which Declare Christ, Whose Completion Though the Jews Saw, Yet Out of the Evil Temper of Their Mind They Did Not Believe He Was the Christ of God, and Condemned the Lord of Glory to the Cross.</h3>

<p>XVI. See how the people provoked the Lord by not believing in Him! Therefore He says: <q>They provoked the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and He was turned to be their enemy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073097"><a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;63:10</a></span> For blindness is cast upon them, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, because when they saw Jesus they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was before all ages  begotten of Him, His only-begotten Son, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, whom they did not own through their unbelief, neither on account of His mighty works, nor yet on account of the prophecies which were written concerning Him. For that He was to be born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, they read this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>: <q>Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall be with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emanuel.</q>  <q>For to us a Child is born, to us a Son is given, whose government is upon His shoulders; and His name is called the Angel of His Great Council, the Wonderful Counsellor, the Mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Potentate, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the Future Age.</q>  Now, that because of their exceeding great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> they would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, the Lord shows in these words: <q>Who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</q>  And afterward: <q>Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive: for the heart of this people has grown gross.</q>  Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was taken from them, because seeing they overlooked, and hearing they heard not. But to you, the converted of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, is the kingdom given, because you, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by preaching, and <q>have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him, or rather are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of Him,</q>  through Jesus, the Saviour and Redeemer of those that hope in Him. For you are translated from your former vain and tedious mode of life and have contemned the lifeless <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and despised the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, which are in darkness, and have run to the <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073104"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;1:9</a></span> and by it have <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the one and only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and Father,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073105"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span> and so are owned to be heirs of His kingdom.

It is therefore your duty, brethren, who are redeemed by the precious blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to observe the days of the passover exactly, with all care, after the vernal equinox, lest you be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to keep the memorial of the one passion twice in a year. Keep it once only in a year for Him that died but once. </p>

<p><span style="italic">Do not you yourselves compute, but keep it when your brethren of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> do so: keep it together with them; and if they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in their computation, be not you concerned. Keep your nights of watching in the middle of the days of unleavened bread. And when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are feasting, do you fast and wail over them, because on the day of their feast they crucified Christ; </span> <span style="italic">and while they are lamenting and eating unleavened bread in bitterness, do you feast</span>.  But no longer be careful to keep the feast with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for we have now no communion with them; for they have been led astray in regard to the calculation itself, which they think they accomplish perfectly, that they may be led astray on every hand, and be fenced off from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But do you observe carefully the vernal equinox, which occurs on the twenty-second of the twelfth month, which is Dystros (March), observing carefully until the twenty-first of the moon, lest the fourteenth of the moon shall fall on another week, and an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> being committed, you should through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> celebrate the passover twice in the year, or celebrate the day of the resurrection of our Lord on any other day than a Sunday. </p>
<h3>A Constitution Concerning the Great Passover Week.</h3>

<p>XVIII. Do you therefore fast on the days of the passover, beginning from the second day of the week until the preparation, and the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, six days, making use of only bread, and <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, and herbs, and water for your drink; but do you abstain on these days from wine and flesh, for they are days of lamentation and not of feasting. Do ye who are able fast the day of the preparation and the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> entirely, tasting nothing till the cock-crowing of the night; but if any one is not able to join them both together, at least let him observe the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>; for the Lord says somewhere, speaking of Himself: <q>When the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, in those days shall they fast.</q>  In these days, therefore, He was taken from us by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so named, and fastened to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and <q>was numbered among the transgressors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073119"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;53:12</a></span> </p>
<h3>Concerning the Watching All the Night of the Great Sabbath, and Concerning the Day of the Resurrection.</h3>

<p>XIX. Wherefore we exhort you to fast on those days, as we also fasted till the evening, when He was taken away from us; but on the rest of the days, before the day of the preparation, let every one eat at the ninth hour, or at the evening, or as every one is able. But from the even of the fifth day till cock-crowing break your fast when it is daybreak of the first day of the week, which is the Lord's day. From the even till cock-crowing keep awake, and assemble together in the church, watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and entreat <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; reading, when you sit up all night, the Law, the Prophets, and the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, until cock-crowing, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> your <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, and reading the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling, and speaking to the people such things as tend to their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: put an end to your sorrow, and beseech God that <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> may be converted, and that He will allow them place of repentance, and the remission of their impiety; for the judge, who was a stranger, <q>washed his hands, and said, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see to it. But <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> cried out, His blood be on us, and on our children.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073120"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;27:24-25</a></span> And when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said, <q>Shall I crucify your king? They cried out, We have no king but C&aelig;sar: crucify Him, crucify Him; for every, one that makes himself a king speaks against C&aelig;sar.</q> And, <q>If you let this man go, you are not C&aelig;sar's friend.</q>  And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> the governor and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> the king commanded Him to be crucified; and that oracle was fulfilled which says, <q>Why did the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> rage, and the people <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> vain things? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ;</q>  and, <q>They cast away the Beloved, as a dead man, who is abominable.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073123"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;14:19</a></span> And since He was crucified on the day of the Preparation, and rose again at break of day on the Lord's day, the scripture was fulfilled which says, <q>Arise, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; judge the earth: for You shall have an inheritance in all the nations;</q>  and again, <q>I will arise, says the Lord; I will put Him in safety, I will wax bold through Him;</q>  and, <q>But You, Lord, have mercy upon me, and raise me up again, and I shall requite them.</q>  For this reason do you also, now the Lord is risen, offer your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, concerning which He made a constitution by us, saying, <q>Do this for a remembrance of me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073127"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;22:19</a></span> and thenceforward leave off your <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and keep a festival, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the pledge of our resurrection, is risen from the dead. And let this be an everlasting ordinance till the consummation of the world, until the Lord come. For to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> the Lord is still dead, but to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> He is risen: to the former, by their unbelief; to the latter, by their full assurance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For the hope in Him is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. After eight days let there be another feast observed with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, the eighth day itself, on which He gave me Thomas, who was hard of belief, full assurance, by showing me the print of the nails, and the wound made in His side by the spear. <span class="stiki" id="note073128"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;20:25</a></span> And again, from the first Lord's day count forty days, from the Lord's day till the fifth day of the week, and celebrate the feast of the ascension of the Lord, whereon He finished all His dispensation and constitution, and returned to that God and Father that sent Him, and sat down at the right hand of power, and remains there until His enemies are put under His feet; who also will come at the consummation of the world with power and great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to judge the quick and the dead, and to recompense to every one according to his works. And then shall they see the beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> whom they pierced; <span class="stiki" id="note073129"><a href="../bible/zec012.htm#verse10">Zechariah&nbsp;12:10</a>; <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;19:37</a></span> and when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, they shall mourn for themselves, tribe by tribe, and their wives apart.  </p>
<h3>A Prophetic Prediction Concerning Christ Jesus.</h3>

<p id="part20">XX. For even now, on the tenth day of the month Gorpi&aelig;us, when they assemble together, they read the Lamentations of Jeremiah, in which it is said, <q>The Spirit before our face, Christ the Lord was taken in their destructions;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073131"><a href="../bible/lam004.htm#verse20">Lamentations&nbsp;4:20</a></span> and Baruch, in whom it is written, <q>This is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; no other shall be esteemed with Him. He found out every way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and showed it to Jacob His son, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His beloved. Afterwards He was seen upon earth, and conversed with men.</q>  And when they read them, they lament and bewail, as themselves suppose, that desolation which happened by <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>; but, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shows, they unwillingly make a prelude to that lamentation which will overtake them. But after ten days from the ascension, which from the first Lord's day is the fiftieth day, keep a great festival: for on that day, at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, the Lord Jesus sent on us the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and we were filled with His energy, and we <q>spoke with new tongues, as that Spirit did suggest to us;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073133"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;2:4</a></span> and we preached both to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that He is the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is <q>determined by Him to be the Judge of quick and dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073134"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse42">Acts&nbsp;10:42</a></span> To Him did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and said: <q>The Lord received fire from the Lord, and rained it down.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073135"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;19:24</a></span> Him did Jacob see as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and said: <q>I have seen God face to face, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is preserved.</q>  Him did <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> entertain, and acknowledge to be the Judge, and his Lord.  Him did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> see in the bush;  concerning Him did he speak in Deuteronomy: <q>A Prophet will the Lord your God raise up unto you out of your brethren, like me; Him shall you hear in all things, whatsoever He shall say unto you. And it shall be, that every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among his people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073139"><a href="../bible/deu018.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a></span> Him did Joshua the son of Nun see, as the captain of the Lord's host, in armour, for their assistance against <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>; to whom he fell down, and worshipped, as a servant does to his master. <span class="stiki" id="note073140"><a href="../bible/jos005.htm#verse14">Joshua&nbsp;5:14</a></span> Him Samuel <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> as the <q>Anointed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073141"><a href="../bible/1sa012.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;12:3</a></span> and thence named the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the kings the anointed. Him David <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, and sung an hymn concerning Him, <q>A song concerning the Beloved;</q>  and adds in his person, and says, <q>Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O You who are mighty in Your beauty and renown: go on, and prosper, and reign, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and meekness, and righteousness; and Your right hand shall guide You after a wonderful manner. Your darts are sharpened, O You that are mighty; the people shall fall under You in the heart of the king's enemies. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above Your fellows.</q> Concerning Him also spoke Solomon, as in His person: <q>The Lord created me the beginning of His ways, for His works: before the world He founded me, in the beginning before He made the earth, before the fountains of waters came, before the mountains were fastened; He begot me before all the hills.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073143"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;8:22-25</a></span> And again: <q>Wisdom built herself an house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073144"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;9:1</a></span> Concerning Him also Isaiah said: <q>A Branch shall come out of the root of Jesse, and a Flower shall spring out of his root.</q> And, <q>There shall be a root of Jesse; and He that is to rise to reign over the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, in Him shall the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> trust.</q>  And Zechariah says:  <q>Behold, your King comes unto you, just, and having <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; meek, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt, the foal of an ass.</q>  Him Daniel describes as <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q>  and receiving all judgment and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> from Him; and as <q>the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, and becoming a great mountain, and filling the whole earth,</q>  dashing to pieces the many governments of the smaller countries, and the <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> of gods, but preaching the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and ordaining the monarchy of the Romans. Concerning Him also did Jeremiah prophesy, saying: <q>The Spirit before His face, Christ the Lord, was taken in their snares: of whom we said, Under His shadow we shall live among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q>  Ezekiel also, and the following <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, affirm everywhere that He is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Lord, the King, the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Angel of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the only-begotten God. Him therefore do we also preach to you, and declare Him to be <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, who ministered to His God and Father for the creation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. By believing in Him you shall live, but by disbelieving you shall be punished. For <q>he that is disobedient to the Son shall not see life, but the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God abides on him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073151"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;3:36</a></span> Therefore, after you have kept the festival of Pentecost, keep one week more festival, and after that fast; for it is reasonable to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> for the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to fast after that relaxation: for both <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah fasted forty days, and Daniel for <q>three weeks of days did not eat desirable bread, and flesh and wine did not enter into his mouth.</q>  And blessed Hannah, when she asked for Samuel, said: <q>I have not drunk wine nor strong drink, and I pour out my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> before the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073153"><a href="../bible/1sa001.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;1:15</a></span> And the Ninevites, when they fasted three days and three nights, <span class="stiki" id="note073154"><a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse5">Jonah&nbsp;3:5</a></span> escaped the execution of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.
