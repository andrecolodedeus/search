<h1>Apostolic Constitutions (Book VI)</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>Section 1. On Heresies</h2>

<h3>Who They Were that Ventured to Make Schisms, and Did Not Escape Punishment.</h3>

<p>I. Above all things, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, avoid the sad and dangerous and most <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistical</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, eschewing them as fire that burns those that come near to it. Avoid also schisms: for it is neither lawful to turn one's mind towards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, nor to separate from those of the same sentiment out of ambition. For some who ventured to set up such practices of old did not escape punishment. For Dathan and Abiram,  who set up in opposition to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, were swallowed up into the earth. But Corah, and those two hundred and fifty who with him raised a sedition against <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, were consumed by fire. Miriam also, who reproached <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, was cast out of the camp for seven days; for she said that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had taken an <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> to wife.  Nay, in the case of Azariah and Uzziah, <span class="stiki" id="note073159"><a href="../bible/2ch026.htm">2&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;xxvi</a></span> the latter of which was king of Judah, but venturing to usurp the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and desiring to offer <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, which it was not lawful for him to do, was hindered by Azariah the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and the fourscore <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; and when he would not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> he found the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> to arise in his forehead, and he hastened to go out, because the Lord had reproved him. </p>
<h3>That It is Not Lawful to Rise Up Either Against the Kingly or the Priestly Office.</h3>

<p>II. Let us therefore, beloved, consider what sort of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that of the seditious is, and what their condemnation. For if he that rises up against kings is worthy of punishment, even though he be a son or a friend, how much more he that rises up against the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>! For by how much the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is more noble than the royal power, as having its concern about the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so much has he a greater punishment who ventures to oppose the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, than he who ventures to oppose the royal power, although neither of them goes unpunished. For neither did Absalom nor Abdadan <span class="stiki" id="note073160"><a href="../bible/2sa018.htm">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;xviii.-xx</a></span> escape without punishment; nor Corah and Dathan. <span class="stiki" id="note073161"><a href="../bible/num016.htm">Numbers&nbsp;xvi</a></span> The former rose against David, and strove concerning the kingdom; the latter against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, concerning pre-eminence. And they both spoke <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; Absalom of his father David, as of an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judge, saying to every one: <q>Your words are good, but there is no one that will hear you, and do you <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Who will make me a ruler?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073162"><a href="../bible/2sa015.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;15:3</a></span> But Abdadan: <q>I have no part in David, nor any inheritance in the son of Jesse.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073163"><a href="../bible/2sa020.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;20:1</a></span> It is plain that he could not endure to be under David's government, of whom God spoke: <q>I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my commands.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073164"><a href="../bible/act013.htm#verse22">Acts&nbsp;13:22</a></span> But Dathan and Abiram, and the followers of Corah, said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>Is it a small thing that you have brought us out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, out of a land flowing with milk and honey? And why have you put out our eyes? And will you rule over us?</q> And they gathered together against him a great congregation; and the followers of Corah said: <q>Has God spoken alone to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? Why is it that He has given the high-<a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> alone? Is not all the congregation of the Lord <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>? And why is <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> alone possessed of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>?</q>  And before this, one said: <q>Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073166"><a href="../bible/exo002.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;2:14</a></span> </p>
<h3>Concerning the Virtue of Moses and the Incredulity of the Jewish Nation, and What Wonderful Works God Did Among Them.</h3>

<p>III. And they raised a sedition against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the meekest of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note073167"><a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse3">Numbers&nbsp;12:3</a></span> and faithful, and affronted  so great a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with the highest ingratitude; him who was their lawgiver, and guardian, and <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and king, the administrator of divine things; one that showed as a creator the mighty works of the Creator; the meekest man, freest from arrogance, and full of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and most benign in his temper; one who had delivered them from many dangers, and freed them from several deaths by his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; who had done so many signs and wonders from God before the people, and had performed <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> for their benefit; who had  brought the ten plagues upon the Egyptians; who had divided the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, and had separated the waters as a wall on this side and on that side, and had led the people through them as through a dry wilderness,  and had drowned <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> and the Egyptians, and all that were in company with them;  and had made the fountain sweet for them with wood, and had brought water out of the stony rock for them when they were thirsty;  and had given them manna out of heaven, and had distributed flesh to them out of the air;  and had afforded them a pillar of fire in the night to enlighten and conduct them, and a pillar of a cloud to shadow them in the day, by reason of the violent heat of the sun;  and had exhibited to them the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, engraven from the mouth, and hand, and writing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in tables of stone, the perfect number of ten commandments;  <q>to whom God spoke face to face, as if a man spoke to his friend;</q>  of whom He said, <q>And there arose not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> like <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</q>  Against him arose the followers of Corah, and the Reubenites,  and threw stones at <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and said: <q>Accept not their offering.</q>  And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God appeared, and sent some down into the earth, and burnt up others with fire; and so, as to those ringleaders of this schismatical deceit which said, <q>Let us make ourselves a leader,</q>  the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their tents, and what appertained to them, and they went down alive into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; but he destroyed the followers of Corah with fire. </p>

<h2>Section 2. History and Doctrines of Heresies</h2>

<h3>That Schism is Made, Not by Him Who Separates Himself from the Ungodly, But Who Departs from the Godly.</h3>

<p>IV. If therefore God inflicted punishment immediately on those that made a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> on account of their ambition, how much rather will He do it upon those who are the leaders of impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>! Will not He inflict severer punishment on those that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> or His creation? But do you, brethren, who are instructed out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, take care not to make divisions in opinion, nor divisions in unity. For those who set up unlawful opinions are marks of perdition to the people. In like manner, do not you of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> come near to such as advance doctrines contrary to the mind of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor be you partakers of their impiety. For says God: <q>Separate yourselves from the midst of these men, lest you perish together with them.</q>  And again: <q>Depart from the midst of them, and separate yourselves, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.</q>  </p>
<h3>Upon What Account Israel, Falsely So Named, is Rejected by God, Demonstrated from the Prophetic Predictions.</h3>

<p>V. For those are most certainly to be avoided who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> God. The greatest part of the ungodly, indeed, are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but these men, as fighters against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are possessed with a wilful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition, as with a disease. For from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <q>pollution is gone out upon all the earth,</q>  as says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah. For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> is now cast off by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, and His house is rejected by Him, as He somewhere speaks: <q>I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine inheritance.</q>  And again, says Isaiah: <q>I will neglect my vineyard, and it shall not be pruned nor dug, and thorns shall spring up upon it, as upon a desert; and I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073185"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;5:6</a></span> He has therefore <q>left His people as a tent in a vineyard, and as a garner in a fig or olive yard, and as a besieged city.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073186"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;1:8</a></span> He has taken away from them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and the prophetic rain, and has replenished His Church with spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as the <q>river of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>;</q>  and has advanced the same <q>as an house upon an hill, or as an high mountain; as a mountain fruitful for milk and fatness, wherein it has pleased God to dwell. For the Lord will inhabit therein to the end.</q>  And He says in Jeremiah: <q>Our sanctuary is an exalted throne of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073189"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse12">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:12</a></span> And He says in Isaiah: <q>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord shall be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and the house of the Lord shall be upon the top of the mountains, and shall be advanced above the hills.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073190"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;2:2</a></span> Since, therefore, He has forsaken His people, He has also left His temple desolate, and rent the veil of the temple, and took from them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; for says He, <q>Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073191"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;23:38</a></span> And He has bestowed upon you, the converted of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as He says by Joel: <q>And it shall come to pass after these things, says <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons shall prophesy, and your daughters shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073192"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel&nbsp;2:28</a></span> For God has taken away all the power and efficacy of His word, and such like visitations, from that people, and has transferred it to you, the converted of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For on this account the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself is very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>: he is removed to you, and has raised against you adversities, seditions, and reproaches, schisms, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. For he had before subdued that people to himself, by their slaying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But you who have left his vanities he tempts in different ways, as he did the blessed Job.  For indeed he opposed that great <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> Joshua the son of Josedek; <span class="stiki" id="note073194"><a href="../bible/zec003.htm#verse1">Zechariah&nbsp;3:1</a></span> and he oftentimes sought to sift us, that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might fail.  But our Lord and Master, having brought him to trial, said unto him: <q>The Lord rebuke you, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and the Lord, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you. Is not this plucked out of the fire as a brand?</q>  And who said then to those that stood by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, <q>Take away his ragged garments from him;</q> and added, <q>Behold, I have taken your iniquities away from you;</q> He will say now, as He said formerly of us when we were assembled together, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may not fail.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073197"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;22:32</a></span> </p>
<h3>That Even Among the Jews There Arose the Doctrine of Several Heresies Hateful to God.</h3>

<p>VI. For even the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation had <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>: for of them were the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, who do not confess the resurrection of the dead; and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who ascribe the practice of sinners to fortune and <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>; and the Basmotheans, who deny <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and say that the world is made by spontaneous motion, and take away the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and the Hemerobaptists, who every day, unless they wash, do not eat&mdash;nay, and unless they cleanse their beds and tables, or platters and cups and seats, do not make use of any of them; and those who are newly risen among us, the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, who will have the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be a mere man, begotten by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> pleasure, and the conjunction of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>. There are also those that separate themselves from all these, and observe the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of their fathers, and these are the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a>. These, therefore, arose among the former people. And now the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one, who is wise to do mischief, and as for goodness, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no such good thing, has cast out some from among us, and has wrought by them <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms. </p>
<h3>Whence the Heresies Sprang, and Who Was the Ringleader of Their Impiety.</h3>

<p>VII. Now the original of the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> began this way: the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> entered into one Simon, of a village called Gitth&aelig;, a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, by profession a magician, and made him the minister of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> design. <span class="stiki" id="note073198"><a href="../bible/act008.htm">Acts&nbsp;viii</a></span> For when Philip our fellow-apostle,  by the gift of the Lord and the energy of His Spirit, performed the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of healing in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, insomuch that the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> were affected, and embraced the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into His name; nay, and that Simon himself, when he saw the signs and wonders which were done without any magic ceremonies, fell into admiration, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and continued in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>&mdash;we heard of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which was among the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> by Philip, and came down  to them; and enlarging much upon the word of doctrine, we laid our hands upon all that were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and we conferred upon them the participation of the Spirit. But when Simon saw that the Spirit was given to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> by the imposition of our hands, he took money, and offered it to us, saying, <q>Give me also the power, that on whomsoever I also shall lay my hand, he may receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073201"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse19">Acts&nbsp;8:19</a></span> being desirous that as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>  deprived <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> by his tasting of the tree of that <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> which was promised him, so also that Simon might entice us by the receiving of money, and might thereby cut us off from the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  that so by exchange we might sell to him for money the inestimable gift of the Spirit. But as we were all troubled at this offer, I Peter, with a fixed attention on that malicious serpent which was in him, said to Simon: <q>Let your money go with you to perdition, because you have thought to purchase the gift of God with money. You have no part in this matter, nor lot in this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for your heart is not right in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Repent therefore of this your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the Lord, if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you. For I perceive you are in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity.</q>  But then Simon was terrified, and said: <q>I entreat you, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the Lord for me, that none of those things which you have spoken come upon me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073205"><a href="../bible/act008.htm">Acts 8:24</a></span> </p>
<h3>Who Were the Successors of Simon's Impiety, and What Heresies They Set Up.</h3>

<p>VIII. But when we went forth among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to preach the word of life, then the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> wrought in the people to send after us false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to the corrupting of the word; and they sent forth one Cleobius, and joined him with Simon, and these became <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to one <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a>, whom they despising, put him down from the principality. Afterwards also others were the authors of absurd doctrines: <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, and Marcus, and Menander, and <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, and Saturnilus. Of these some own the doctrine of many gods, some only of three, but contrary to each other, without beginning, and ever with one another, and some of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of them, and those unknown ones also. And some reject marriage; and their doctrine is, that it is not the appointment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and others abhor some kinds of food: some are impudent in uncleanness, such as those who are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> called <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a>. And Simon meeting me Peter, first at C&aelig;sarea Stratonis (where the faithful Cornelius, a Gentile, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on the Lord Jesus by me), endeavoured to pervert the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; there being with me the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> children, Zacch&aelig;us, who was once a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, and Barnabas; and Nicetas and Aquila, brethren of Clement the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and citizen of Rome, who was the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, our fellow-apostle and fellow-helper in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. I thrice discoursed before them with him concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet, and concerning the monarchy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and when I had overcome him by the power of the Lord, and had put him to silence, I drove him away into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. </p>
<h3>How Simon, Desiring to Fly by Some Magical Arts, Fell Down Headlong from on High at the Prayers of Peter, and Brake His Feet, and Hands, and Ankle-Bones.</h3>

<p>IX . Now when he was in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he mightily disturbed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and subverted many, and brought them over to himself, and astonished the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> with his skill in magic, insomuch that once, in the middle of the day, he went into their theatre, and commanded the people that they should bring me also by force into the theatre, and promised he would fly in the air; and when all the people were in suspense at this, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> by myself. And indeed he was carried up into the air by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and did fly on high in the air, saying that he was returning into heaven, and that he would supply them with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things from thence. And the people making acclamations to him, as to a god, I stretched out my hands to heaven, with my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and besought God through the Lord Jesus to throw down this pestilent fellow, and to destroy the power of those <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> that made use of the same for the seduction and perdition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to dash him against the ground, and bruise him, but not to kill him. And then, fixing my eyes on Simon, I said to him: <q>If I be a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a real apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and a teacher of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and not of deceit, as you are, Simon, I command the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> powers of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> from <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, by whom <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon the Magician</a> is carried, to let go their hold, that he may fall down headlong from his height, that he may be exposed to the laughter of those that have been seduced by him.</q> When I had said these words, Simon was deprived of his powers, and fell down headlong with a great noise, and was violently dashed against the ground, and had his hip and ankle-bones broken; and the people cried out, saying, <q>There is one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom Peter rightly preaches in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> And many left him; but some who were worthy of perdition continued in his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">wicked doctrine</a>. And after this manner the most <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistical</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13797a.htm">Simonians</a> was first established in Rome; and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> wrought by the rest of the false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>  also. </p>
<h3>How the Heresies Differ from Each Other, and from the Truth.</h3>

<p>X . Now all these had one and the same design of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to spread their doctrine that He is an unknown being, and not the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor the Creator of the world; but one who cannot be spoken of, ineffable, not to be named, and begotten by Himself; that we are not to make use of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; that there is no <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and no resurrection to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; that there is no judgment nor retribution; that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; that we must only indulge our pleasures, and turn to any sort of worship without distinction. Some of them say that there are many gods, some that there are three gods without beginning, some that there are two unbegotten gods, some that there are innumerable <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>. Further, some of them teach that men are not to marry, and must abstain from flesh and wine, affirming that marriage, and the begetting of children, and the eating of certain foods, are abominable; that so, as sober <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, they may make their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> opinions to be received as worthy of belief. And some of them absolutely prohibit the eating of flesh, as being the flesh not of brute animals, but of creatures that have a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as though those that ventured to slay them would be charged with the crime of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. But others of them affirm that we must only abstain from swine's flesh, but may eat such as are clean by the law; and that we ought to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, according to the law, and to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Jesus as in an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man and a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. But others teach that men ought to be impudent in uncleanness, and to abuse the flesh, and to go through all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> practices, as if this were the only way for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to avoid the rulers of this world. Now all these are the instruments of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and the children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. </p>

<h2>Section 3. The Heresies Attacked by the Apostles</h2>

<h3>An Exposition of the Preaching of the Apostles.</h3>

<p>XI. But we, who are the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the sons of peace, do preach the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and right word of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and declare one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Lord of the law and of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the Maker of the world, the Father of Christ; not a being that caused Himself, or begot Himself, as they suppose, but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and without original, and inhabiting light inaccessible; not two or three, or manifold, but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> one only; not a being that cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> or spoken of, but who was preached by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; the Almighty, the Supreme Governor of all things, the All-powerful Being; the God and Father of the Only-begotten, and of the First-born of the whole creation; one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father of one Son, not of many; the Maker of one Comforter by Christ, the Maker of the other orders, the one Creator of the several creatures by Christ, the same their Preserver and Legislator by Him; the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the resurrection, and of the judgment, and of the retribution which shall be made by Him: that this same Christ was pleased to become man, and went through life without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and suffered, and rose from the dead, and returned to Him that sent Him. We also say that every creature of God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and nothing abominable; that everything for the support of life, when it is partaken of righteously, is very good: for, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>all things were very good.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073207"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis&nbsp;1:31</a></span> We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that lawful marriage, and the begetting of children, is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and undefiled; for difference of sexes was formed in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> for the increase of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. We acknowledge with us a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is incorporeal and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>&mdash;not corruptible as bodies are, but <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, as being rational and free. We abhor all unlawful mixtures, and that which is practised by some against nature as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and impious. We profess there will be a resurrection both of the just and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and a retribution. We profess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not a mere man, but <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, and man the Mediator between God and men, the High Priest of the Father; nor are we <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that He has come <q>to whom the inheritance was reserved,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073208"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;49:10</a></span> and on whose account the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> were kept distinct&mdash; <q>the expectation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who sprang out of Judah,  the Son from the branch, the flower from Jesse, whose government is upon His shoulder.  </p>
<h3>For Those that Confess Christ, But are Desirous to Judaize.</h3>

<p>XII. But because this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> did then seem the more powerful to seduce men, and the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was in danger,  we the twelve assembled together at Jerusalem (for Matthias was chosen to be an apostle in the room of the betrayer, and took the lot of Judas; as it is said, <q>His <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>  let another take</q>). We deliberated, together with James the Lord's brother, what was to be done; and it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him and to the elders to speak to the people words of doctrine. For certain men likewise went down from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and taught the brethren who were there, saying: <q>Unless you are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> after the manner of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and walk according to the other customs which he ordained, you cannot be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073213"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;15:1</a></span> When, therefore, there had been no small dissension and disputation, the brethren which were at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that we were all met together about this question, sent out unto us men who were faithful and understanding in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to learn concerning this question. And they, when they had come to Jerusalem, declared to us what questions were arisen in the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">church of Antioch</a>&mdash;namely, that some said men ought to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and to observe the other purifications. And when some said one thing, and some another, I Peter stood up, and said unto them: <q>Men and brethren, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how that from ancient days God made choice among you that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> should hear the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> by my mouth, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the hearts, bare them <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note073214"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse7">Acts&nbsp;15:7-8</a></span> For an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord appeared on a certain time to Cornelius, <span class="stiki" id="note073215"><a href="../bible/act010.htm">Acts&nbsp;x</a></span> who was a centurion of the Roman government, and spoke to him concerning me, that he should send for me, and hear the word of life from my mouth. He therefore sent for me from Joppa to C&aelig;sarea Stratonis; and when I was ready to go to him, I would have eaten. And while they made ready I was in the upper room <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>; and I saw heaven opened, and a vessel, knit at the four corners like a splendid sheet, let down to the earth, wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the heaven. And there came a voice out of heaven to me, saying, Arise, Peter; kill, and eat. And I said, By no means, Lord: for I have never eaten anything common or unclean. And there came a voice a second time, saying, What God has cleansed, call not common. And this was done thrice, and the vessel was received up again into heaven. But as I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> what this vision should mean, the Spirit said to me, Behold, men seek you; but rise up, and go your way with them, nothing doubting, for I have sent them.  These men were those which came from the centurion, and so by reasoning I understood the word of the Lord which is written: 'Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'  And again: 'All the ends of the earth shall remember, and turn unto the Lord, and all the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> shall worship before Him: for the kingdom is in the Lord's, and He is the governor of the nations.'  And observing that there were expressions everywhere concerning the calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, I rose up, and went with them, and entered into the man's house. And while I was preaching the word, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> fell upon him, and upon those that were with him, as it did upon us at the beginning; and He put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And I perceived that God is no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; but that in every nation he that fears Him, and works righteousness, will be accepted with Him. But even the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> which were of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> were astonished at this. Now therefore why do you tempt <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to lay an heavy yoke upon the neck of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear? But by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> we shall be saved, even as they.  For the Lord has loosed us from our bonds, and has made our burden light, and has loosed the heavy yoke from us by His clemency.</q> While I spoke these things, the whole multitude kept silence. But James the Lord's brother answered and said: <q>Men and brethren, hearken unto me; Simeon has declared how God at first visited to take out a people from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> for His name. And to this agree the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; as it is written: 'Afterwards I will return, and will raise again and rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will rebuild its ruins, and will again set it up, that the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the nations upon whom my name is called, says the Lord, who does these things.'  Known unto God are all His works from the beginning of the world. Wherefore my sentence is, that we do not trouble those who from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> turn unto God: but to charge them that they abstain from the pollutions of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and from what is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; which <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were given to the ancients who lived before the law, under the law of nature, Enos, <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>, Job, and if there be any other of the same sort.</q>  Then it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to us the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and to James the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and to the elders, with the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to send men chosen from among our own selves, with Barnabas, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul of Tarsus</a>, the apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and Judas who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren, and wrote by their hand, as follows: <q>The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and elders, and brethren,  to the brethren of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and Cilicia of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, send greeting: Since we have heard that some from us have troubled you with words, subverting your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, to whom we gave no such commandment, it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to us, when we were met together with one accord, to send chosen men to you, with our beloved <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, men that have hazarded their lives for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom you sent unto us. We have sent also with them Judas and Silas, who shall themselves declare the same things by mouth. For it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and to us, to lay no other burden upon you than these necessary things; that you abstain from things offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which things if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare well.</q>  We accordingly sent this epistle; but we ourselves remained in Jerusalem many days, consulting together for the public benefit, for the well ordering of all things. </p>
<h3>That We Must Separate from Heretics.</h3>

<p>XIII. But after a long time we visited the brethren, and confirmed them with the word of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and charged them to avoid those who, under the name of Christ and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Christ and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and in the clothing of sheep hide the wolf. For these are false Christs, and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, and false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, deceivers and corrupters, portions of foxes, the destroyers of the herbs of the vineyards: <q>for whose sake the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many will wax cold. But he that endures steadfast to the end, the same shall be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073224"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;24:12-13</a></span> Concerning whom, that He might secure us, the Lord declared, saying: <q>There will come to you men in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. You shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them by their fruits; take care of them. For false Christs and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> shall arise and shall deceive many.</q>  </p>
<h3>Who Were the Preachers of the Catholic Doctrine, and Which are the Commandments Given by Them.</h3>

<p>XIV. On whose account also we, who are now assembled in one place&mdash;Peter and Andrew; James and John, sons of Zebedee; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew; James the son of Alph&aelig;us, and Lebb&aelig;us who is surnamed Thadd&aelig;us; and Simon the Canaanite, <span class="stiki" id="note073226"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;10:2</a></span> and Matthias, who instead of Judas was numbered with us; and James the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the chosen vessel, having all met together, have written to you this <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine for the confirmation of you, to whom the oversight of the universal Church is committed: wherein we declare unto you, that there is only one God Almighty, besides whom there is no other, and that you must worship and adore Him alone, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, in the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit;  that you are to make use of the sacred Scriptures, the law, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; to avoid all unlawful actions; to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the resurrection and the judgment, and to expect the retribution; and to use all His creatures with thankfulness, as the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and having no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in them; to marry after a lawful manner, for such marriage is unblameable.

But he that divides that again into two which has become one, is the enemy of the creation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the adversary of His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. In like manner, he that retains her that is corrupted is a transgressor of the law of nature; since <q>he that retains an adulteress is foolish and impious.</q>  For says He, <q>Cut her off from your flesh;</q>  for she is not an help, but a snare, bending her mind from you to another. Nor be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in your flesh, but let the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> which is of the heart by the Spirit suffice for the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; for He says, <q>Be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> to your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in the foreskin of your heart.</q>  </p>
<h3>That We Ought Not to Rebaptize, Nor to Receive that Baptism Which is Given by the Ungodly, Which is Not Baptism, But a Pollution.</h3>

<p>XV. Be likewise contented with one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> alone, that which is into the death of the Lord; not that which is conferred by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but that which is conferred by unblameable <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <q>in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073236"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> and let not that which comes from the ungodly be received by you, nor let that which is done by the godly be disannulled by a second. For as there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, one Christ, and one Comforter, and one death of the Lord in the body, so let that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is unto Him be but one. But those that receive polluted <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from the ungodly will become partners in their opinions. For they are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. For God says to them: <q>Because you have rejected <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, I will also reject you from the office of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to me.</q>  Nor indeed are those that are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by them initiated, but are polluted, not receiving the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but the bond of impiety. And, besides, they that attempt to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those already initiated crucify the Lord afresh, slay Him a second time, laugh at divine and ridicule <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, affront the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, dishonour the sacred blood of Christ as common blood, are impious against Him that sent, Him that suffered, and Him that witnessed. Nay, he that, out of contempt, will not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, shall be condemned as an unbeliever, and shall be reproached as ungrateful and foolish. For the Lord says: <q>Unless a man be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he shall by no means enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073238"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;3:5</a></span> And again: <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be saved; but he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not shall be damned.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073239"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse16">Mark&nbsp;16:16</a></span> But he that says, When I am dying I will be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, lest I should <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and defile my <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and forgetful of his own nature. For <q>do not delay to turn unto the Lord, for you know not what the next day will bring forth.</q>  Do you also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> your infants, and bring them up in the nurture and admonition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For says He: <q>Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073241"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;19:14</a></span> </p>
<h3>Concerning Books with False Inscriptions.</h3>

<p>XVI. We have sent all these things to you, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> our opinion, what it is; and that you may not receive those books which obtain in our name, but are written by the ungodly. For you are not to attend to the names of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the things, and their settled opinions. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Simon and Cleobius, and their followers, have compiled poisonous books under the name of Christ and of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and do carry them about in order to deceive you who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and us His servants. And among the ancients also some have written <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, and Adam, and Isaiah, and David, and Elijah, and of the three patriarchs, pernicious and repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The same things even now have the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> done, reproaching the creation, marriage, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, the begetting of children, the law, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; inscribing certain barbarous names, and, as they think, of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but, to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, which suggest things to them: whose doctrine eschew, that you may not be partakers of the punishment due to those that write such things for the seduction and perdition of the faithful and unblameable <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. </p>
<h3>Matrimonial Precepts Concerning Clergymen.</h3>

<p>XVII. We have already said, that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, when they are constituted, must be but once married, whether their wives be alive or whether they be dead; and that it is not lawful for them, if they are unmarried when they are ordained, to be married afterwards; or if they be then married, to marry a second time, but to be content with that wife which they had when they came to ordination.  We also appoint that the ministers, and singers, and readers, and porters, shall be only once married. But if they entered into the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> before they were married, we permit them to marry, if they have an inclination thereto, lest they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and incur punishment.  But we do not permit any one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to take to wife either a courtesan, or a servant, or a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, or one that is <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a>, as also the law says. Let the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> be a pure virgin; or, at the least, a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who has been but once married, faithful, and well esteemed. <span class="stiki" id="note073244"><a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse7">Leviticus&nbsp;21:7,&nbsp;14</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:9</a></span> </p>
<h3>An Exhortation Commanding to Avoid the Communion of the Impious Heretics.</h3>

<p>XVIII. Receive the penitent, for this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Instruct the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> in the elements of religion, and then <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them. Eschew the antheistical <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who are past repentance, and separate them from the faithful, and excommunicate them from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, and charge the faithful to abstain entirely from them, and not to partake with them either in sermons or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>: for these are those that are enemies to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and lay snares for it; who corrupt the flock, and defile the heritage of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, pretenders only to wisdom, and the vilest of men; concerning whom Solomon the wise said: <q>The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> doers pretend to act piously.</q> For, says he, <q>there is a way which seems right to some, but the ends thereof look to the bottom of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073245"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;14:12</a></span> These are they concerning whom the Lord declared His mind with bitterness and severity, saying that <q>they are false Christs and false teachers;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073246"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;24:24</a></span> who have <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and done despite to the gift they had from Him after the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <span style="italic">of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a></span>, <q>to whom forgiveness shall not be granted, neither in this world nor in that which is to come;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073247"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;12:32</a></span> who are both more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> than the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and more <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistical</a> than the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the God over all, and tread under foot His Son, and do despite to the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; who deny the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or pretend hypocritically to receive them, to the affronting of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the deceiving of those that come among them; who abuse the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, and as for righteousness, they do not so much as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it is; who spoil the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, as the <q>little foxes do the vineyard;</q>  whom we exhort you to avoid, lest you lay traps for your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. <q>For he that walks with wise men shall be wise, but he that walks with the foolish shall be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q>  For we ought neither to run along with a thief, nor put in our lot with an adulterer; since <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David says: <q>O Lord, I have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> You, and I am withered away on account of Your enemies. I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> them with a perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>: they were to me as enemies.</q>  And God reproaches <a href="../cathen/08502c.htm">Jehoshaphat</a> with his friendship towards Ahab, and his league with him and with Ahaziah, by Jonah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Are you in friendship with a sinner?

For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the Lord has spared you; yet are your works shattered, and your ships broken to pieces.</q>  Eschew therefore their fellowship, and estrange yourselves from their friendship. For concerning them did the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> declare, and say: <q>It is not lawful to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with the ungodly,</q>  says the Lord. For these are hidden wolves, dumb dogs, that cannot bark, who at present are but few, but in process of time, when the end of the world draws near, will be more in number and more troublesome, of whom said the Lord, <q>Will the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, when He comes, find <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the earth?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073254"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm">Luke&nbsp;18:8</a></span> and, <q>Because iniquity shall abound, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many shall wax cold;</q> and, <q>There shall come false Christs and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, and shall show signs in the heaven, so as, if it were possible, to deceive the elect:</q>  from whose deceit <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who is our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, will deliver us. For we ourselves, as we passed through the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and confirmed the churches, curing some with much exhortation and healing words, restored them again when they were in the certain way to death. But those that were incurable we cast out from the flock, that they might not infect the lambs, which were found with their scabby disease, but might continue before the Lord God pure and undefiled, sound and unspotted. And this we did in every city, everywhere through the whole world, and have left to you the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> this very <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine worthily and righteously, as a memorial or confirmation to those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and we have sent it by our fellow-minister Clement, our most faithful and intimate son in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, together with Barnabas, and Timothy our most dearly beloved son, and the genuine Mark, together with whom we recommend to you also Titus and Luke, and Jason and Lucius, and Sosipater. <span class="stiki" id="note073256"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;16:21</a></span> </p>

<h2>Section 4. Of the Law</h2>

<p>By whom also we exhort you in the Lord to abstain from your old conversation, vain bonds, separations, observances, distinction of meats, and daily washings: for <q>old things are passed away; behold, all things have become new.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073257"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> </p>
<h3>To Those that Speak Evil of the Law.</h3>

<p>XIX . For since you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and all His dispensation, as it has been from the beginning, that He gave a plain law to assist the law of nature,  such a one as is pure, saving, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, in which His own name was inscribed,  perfect, which is never to fail, being complete in ten commands, unspotted, converting <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>;  which, when the Hebrews forgot, He put them in mind of it by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Malachi, saying, <q>Remember the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gave you in charge commandments and ordinances.</q>  Which law is so very <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and righteous, that even our Saviour, when on a certain time He healed one <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, and afterwards nine, said to the first, <q>Go, show yourself to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and offer the gift which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commanded for a testimony unto them;</q>  and afterwards to the nine, <q>Go, show yourselves to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073263"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;17:14</a></span> For He nowhere has dissolved the law, as Simon pretends, but fulfilled it; for He says: <q>One iota, or one tittle, shall not pass from the law until all be fulfilled.</q> For says He, <q>I come not to dissolve the law, but to fulfil it.</q>  For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself, who was at once the lawgiver, and the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and the king, and Elijah, the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> follower of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, were present at our Lord's transfiguration in the mountain,  and witnesses of His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> and of His sufferings, as the intimate friends of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but not as enemies and strangers. Whence it is demonstrated that the law is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, as also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. </p>
<h3>Which is the Law of Nature, and Which is that Afterwards Introduced, and Why It Was Introduced.</h3>

<p>XX . Now the law is the decalogue, which the Lord promulgated to them with an audible voice,  before the people made that calf which represented the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Apis.  And the law is righteous, and therefore is it called the law, because judgments are thence made according to the law of nature, which the followers of Simon abuse, supposing they shall not be judged thereby, and so shall escape punishment. This law is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and such as lays no compulsion in things positive. For He says: <q>If you will make me an altar, you shall make it of earth.</q>  It does not say, <q>Make one,</q> but, <q>If you will make.</q> It does not impose a necessity, but gives leave to their own free liberty. For God does not stand in need of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, being by nature above all want. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that, as of old, Abel, beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and those that succeeded, without being required, but only moved of themselves by the law of nature, did offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to God out of a grateful mind; so He did now permit the Hebrews, not commanding, but, if they had a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, permitting them; and if they offered from a right intention, showing Himself pleased with their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. Therefore He says: <q>If you desire to offer, do not offer to me as to one that stands in need of it, for I stand in need of nothing; for the world is mine, and the fullness thereof.</q>  But when this people became forgetful of that, and called upon a calf as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, instead of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to him did ascribe the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their coming out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, saying, <q>These are your gods, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which have brought you out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>;</q>  and when these men had committed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> with the <q>similitude of a calf that eats hay;</q> and denied God who had visited them by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>  in their afflictions, and had done signs with his hand and rod, and had smitten the Egyptians with ten plagues; who had divided the waters of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> into two parts; who had led them in the midst of the water, as a horse upon the ground; who had drowned their enemies, and those that laid wait for them; who at Marah had made sweet the bitter fountain; who had brought water out of the sharp rock till they were satisfied; who had overshadowed them with a pillar of a cloud on account of the immoderate heat, and with a pillar of fire which enlightened and guided them when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not which way they were to go; who gave them manna from heaven, and gave them quails for flesh from the sea;  who gave them the law in the mountain; whose voice He had vouchsafed to let them hear; Him did they deny, and said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, <q>Make us gods who shall go before us;</q>  and they made a molten calf, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to an idol;&mdash; then was God <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, as being ungratefully treated by them, and bound them with bonds which could not be loosed, with a mortifying burden and a hard collar, and no longer said, <q>If you make</q> but, <q>Make an altar,</q> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> perpetually; for you are forgetful and ungrateful. Offer burnt-offerings therefore continually, that you may be mindful of me. For since you have wickedly abused your power, I lay a necessity upon you for the time to come, and I command you to abstain from certain meats; and I ordain you the distinction of clean and unclean creatures, although every creature is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as being made by me; and I appoint you several separations, purgations, frequent washings and sprinklings, several purifications, and several times of rest; and if you neglect any of them, I determine that punishment which is proper to the disobedient, that being pressed and galled by your collar, you may depart from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, and laying aside that, <q>These are your gods, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</q>  may be mindful of that, <q>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is one Lord;</q>  and may run back again to that law which is inserted by me in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <q>that there is only one God in heaven and on earth, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him with all your heart, and all your might, and all your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> and to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> none but Him, nor to admit the names of other gods into your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, nor to let your tongue utter them out of your mouth. He bound them for the hardness of their hearts, that by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a>, and resting, and purifying themselves, and by similar observances, they might come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who ordained these things for them. </p>

<p>XXI. <q>But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073276"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;13:16</a></span> Yours, I say, who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not by necessity, but by a sound understanding, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to Him that called you. For you are released from the bonds, and freed from the servitude. For says He:  <q>I call you no longer servants, but friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father have I made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073278"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;15:15</a></span> For to them that would not see nor hear, not for the want of those senses, but for the excess of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, <q>I gave statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they would not live;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073279"><a href="../bible/eze020.htm#verse25">Ezekiel&nbsp;20:25</a></span> they are looked upon as not good, as burnings and a sword, and medicines are esteemed enemies by the sick, and impossible to be observed on account of their obstinacy: whence also they brought death upon them being not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>. </p>
<h3>That the Law for Sacrifices is Additional, Which Christ When He Came Took Away.</h3>

<p>XXII. You therefore are blessed who are delivered from the curse, For Christ, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, by His coming has confirmed and completed the law, but has taken away the additional precepts, although not all of them, yet at least the more grievous ones; having confirmed the former, and abolished the latter, and has again set the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> of man at liberty, not subjecting him to the penalty of a temporal death, but giving <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to him according to another constitution. Wherefore He says: <q>If any man will come after me, let him come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073280"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;16:24</a></span> And again: <q>Will you also go away?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073281"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse67">John&nbsp;6:67</a></span> And besides, before His coming He refused the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the people, while they frequently offered them, when they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against Him, and thought He was to be appeased by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, but not by repentance. For thus He speaks: <q>Why do you bring to me frankincense from Saba, and cinnamon from a remote land? Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, and your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are not sweet to me.</q>  And afterwards: <q>Gather your burnt-offerings, together with your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and eat flesh. For I did not command you, when I brought you out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, concerning burnt-offerings and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073283"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse21">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:21-22</a></span> And He says by Isaiah: <q>To what purpose do you bring me a multitude of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>? Says the Lord. I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and I will not accept the fat of lambs, and the blood of bulls and of goats. Nor do you come and appear before me; for who has required these things at your hands? Do not go on to tread my courts any more. If you bring me fine flour, it is vain: <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> is an abomination unto me: your new moons, and your <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, and your great day, I cannot bear them: your <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, and your rests, and your feasts, my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> them; I am over-full of them.</q>  And He says by another: <q>Depart from me; the sound of your <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and the psalms of your musical instruments, I will not hear.</q>  And Samuel says to Saul, when he thought to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>: <q>Obedience is better than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and hearkening than the fat of rams. For, behold, the Lord does not so much delight in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> Him.</q>  And He says by David: <q>I will take no calves out of your house, nor he-goats out of your flock. If I should be hungry, I would not tell you; for the whole world is mine, and the fullness thereof. Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Sacrifice to God the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise, and pay your vows to the Most High.</q>  And in all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> in like manner He refuses their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> on account of their sinning against Him. For <q>the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the impious are an abomination with the Lord, since they offer them in an unlawful manner.</q>  And again: <q>Their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are to them as bread of lamentation; all that eat of them shall be defiled.</q>  If, therefore, before His coining He sought for <q>a clean heart and a contrite spirit</q>  more than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, much rather would He abrogate those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, I mean those by blood, when He came. Yet He so abrogated them as that He first fulfilled them. For He was both <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and sprinkled, and offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and whole burnt-offerings, and made use of the rest of their customs. And He that was the Lawgiver became Himself the fulfilling of the law; not taking away the law of nature, but abrogating those additional <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that were afterwards introduced, although not all of them neither. </p>
<h3>How Christ Became a Fulfiller of the Law, and What Parts of It He Put a Period To, or Changed, or Transferred.</h3>

<p>XXIII. For He did not take away the law of nature, but confirmed it. For He that said in the law, <q>The Lord your God is one Lord;</q>  the same says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>That they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073292"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span> And He that said, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073293"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus&nbsp;19:18</a></span> says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, renewing the same precept, <q>A new commandment I give unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073294"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;13:34</a></span> He who then forbade <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, does now forbid causeless <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note073295"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22</a></span> He that forbade <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, does now forbid all unlawful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

Nor did He make <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to root out our natural <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but only to forbid the excess of them. <span class="stiki" id="note073299"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;5:38</a></span> He who had commanded to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, was Himself subject to them. <span class="stiki" id="note073300"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse51">Luke&nbsp;2:51</a></span> He who had commanded to keep the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, by resting thereon for the sake of meditating on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, has now commanded us to consider of the law of creation, and of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> every day, and to return thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He abrogated <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> when He had Himself fulfilled it.

Instead of one tribe, He has appointed that out of every nation the best should be ordained for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; and that not their bodies should be examined for blemishes, but their religion and their lives. Instead of a bloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, He has appointed that reasonable and unbloody mystical one of His body and blood, which is performed to represent the death of the Lord by <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>. Instead of the divine service confined to one place, He has commanded and appointed that He should be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> from sunrising to sunsetting in every place of His dominion.  He did not therefore take away the law from us, but the bonds. For concerning the law <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says: <q>You shall meditate on the word which I command you, sitting in your house, and rising up, and walking in the way.</q>  And David says: <q>His delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law will he meditate day and night.</q>  For everywhere would he have us subject to His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, but not transgressors of them. For says He: <q>Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are they that search out His testimonies; with their whole heart shall they seek Him.</q>  And again: <q>Blessed are we, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because those things that are pleasing to God are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073307"><a href="../bible/bar004.htm#verse4">Baruch&nbsp;4:4</a></span> And the Lord says: <q>If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> are you if you do them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073308"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;13:17</a></span> </p>
<h3>That It Pleased the Lord that the Law of Righteousness Should Be Demonstrated by the Romans.</h3>

<p>XXIV. Nor does He desire that the law of righteousness should only be demonstrated by us; but He is pleased that it should appear and shine by means of the Romans. For these Romans, believing in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, left off their <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and entertain the good, and punish the bad. But they hold the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> under tribute, and do not suffer them to make use of their own ordinances. </p>
<h3>How God, on Account of Their Impiety Towards Christ, Made the Jews Captives, and Placed Them Under Tribute.</h3>

<p>XXV. Because, indeed, they drew servitude upon themselves voluntarily, when they said, <q>We have no king but C&aelig;sar;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073309"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;19:15</a></span> and, <q>If we do not slay Christ, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, and the Romans will come and will take away both our place and nation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073310"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse48">John&nbsp;11:48</a></span> And so they prophesied unwittingly. For accordingly the nations <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, and they themselves were deprived by the Romans of their power, and of their legal worship; and they have been forbidden to slay whom they please, and to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> when they will. Wherefore they are accursed, as not able to perform the things they are commanded to do. For says He: <q>Cursed be he that does not continue in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.</q>  Now it is impossible in their dispersion, while they are among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, for them to perform all things in their law. For the divine <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> forbids both to rear an altar out of Jerusalem, and to read the law out of the bounds of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.  Let us therefore follow Christ, that we may inherit His blessings. Let us walk after the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Let us eschew the worshippers of many gods, and the murderers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the murderers of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistical</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Let us be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to Christ as to our King, as having authority to change several constitutions, and having, as a legislator, wisdom to make new constitutions in different circumstances; yet so that everywhere the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature be immutably preserved. </p>

<h2>Section 5. The Teaching of the Apostles in Opposition to Jewish and Gentile Superstitions, Especially in Regard to Marriage and Funerals</h2>

<h3>That We Ought to Avoid the Heretics as the Corrupters of Souls.</h3>

<p>XXVI. Do you therefore, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and you of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, avoid all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who abuse the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For they are enemies to God Almighty, and disobey Him, and do not confess Christ to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For they also deny His generation according to the flesh; they are ashamed of the cross; they abuse His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> and His death; they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>; they take away His generation before all ages. Nay, some of them are impious after another manner, imagining the Lord to be a mere man, supposing Him to consist of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. But others of them suppose that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Himself is the God over all, and glorify Him as His own Father, and suppose Him to be both the Son and the Comforter; than which doctrines what can be more detestable? Others, again, of them do refuse certain meats, and say that marriage with the procreation of children is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and the contrivance of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and being ungodly themselves, they are not willing to rise again from the dead on account of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Wherefore also they ridicule the resurrection, and say, We are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people, unwilling to eat and to drink; and they fancy that they shall rise again from the dead <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> without flesh, who shall be condemned for ever in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>. Fly therefore from them, lest you perish with them in their impieties. </p>
<h3>Of Some Jewish and Gentile Observances.</h3>

<p>XXVII. Now if any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> keep to the Jewish customs and observances concerning the natural emission and nocturnal pollutions, and the lawful conjugal acts, <span class="stiki" id="note073313"><a href="../bible/lev015.htm">Leviticus&nbsp;xv</a></span> let them tell us whether in those hours or days, when they undergo any such thing, they observe not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, or to touch a <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, or to partake of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>? And if they own it to be so, it is plain they are void of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which always continues with the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. For concerning <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> Solomon says: <q>That every one may prepare himself, that so when he sleeps it may keep him, and when he arises it may talk with him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073314"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;6:22</a></span> For if you think, O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, when you are seven days in your separation, that you are void of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, then if you should die suddenly you will depart void of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and without assured hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or else you must <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the Spirit always is inseparable from you, as not being in a place. But you stand in need of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, and the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as having been guilty of no fault in this matter. For neither lawful mixture, nor child-bearing, nor the menstrual purgation, nor nocturnal pollution, can defile the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or separate the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from him. Nothing but impiety and unlawful practice can do that. For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> always abides with those that are possessed of it, so long as they are worthy; and those from whom it is departed, it leaves them desolate, and exposed to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit. Now every man is filled either with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> or with the unclean spirit; and it is not possible to avoid the one or the other, unless they can receive opposite spirits. For the Comforter <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> every lie, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But every one that is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> agreeably to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is separated from the diabolical spirit, and is under the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> remains with him so long as he is doing good, and fills him with wisdom and understanding, and suffers not the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit to approach him, but watches over his goings. You therefore, O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, if, as you say, in the days of your separation you are void of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, you are then filled with the unclean one; for by neglecting to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and to read you will invite him to you, though he were unwilling. For this spirit, of all others, loves the ungrateful, the <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a>, the careless, and the drowsy, since he himself by ingratitude was distempered with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and was thereby deprived by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his dignity; having rather chosen to be a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> than an archangel. Wherefore, O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, eschew such vain words, and be ever mindful of God that created you, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to Him. For He is your Lord, and the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; and meditate in His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> without observing any such things, such as the natural purgation, lawful mixture, child-birth, a miscarriage, or a blemish of the body; since such observations are the vain inventions of foolish men, and such inventions as have no sense in them. Neither the burial of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor a dead man's bone, nor a sepulchre, nor any particular sort of food, nor the nocturnal pollution, can defile the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man; but only impiety towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and transgression, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> towards one's neighbour; I mean rapine, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, or if there be anything contrary to His righteousness, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> or fornication. Wherefore, beloved, avoid and eschew such observations, for they are heathenish. For we do not abominate a dead man, as do they, seeing we hope that he will live again. Nor do we <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> lawful mixture; for it is their practice to act impiously in such instances. For the conjunction of man and wife, if it be with righteousness, is agreeable to the mind of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>For He that made them at the beginning made them male and female; and He blessed them, and said, Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073315"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;19:4</a>; <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> If, therefore, the difference of sexes was made by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God for the generation of multitudes, then must the conjunction of male and female be also acceptable to His mind. </p>
<h3>Of the Love of Boys, Adultery, and Fornication.</h3>

<p>XXVIII. But we do not say so of that mixture that is contrary to nature, or of any unlawful practice; for such are enmity to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> is contrary to nature, as is also that with brute beasts. But <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and fornication are against the law; the one whereof is impiety, the other <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and, in a word, no other than a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But neither sort of them is without its punishment in its own proper nature. For the practisers of one sort attempt the dissolution of the world, and endeavour to make the natural course of things to change for one that is unnatural; but those of the second sort&mdash; the adulterers&mdash; are <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> by corrupting others' marriages, and dividing into two what God has made one, rendering the children suspected, and exposing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> husband to the snares of others. And fornication is the destruction of one's own flesh, not being made use of for the procreation of children, but entirely for the sake of pleasure, which is a mark of incontinency, and not a sign of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. All these things are forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; for thus say the oracles: <q>You shall not lie with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> as with womankind.</q>  <q>For such a one is accursed, and you shall stone them with stones: they have wrought abomination.</q>  <q>Every one that lies with a beast, slay him: he has wrought <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in his people.</q>  <q>And if any one defile a married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, slay them both: they have wrought <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; they are guilty; let them die.</q>  And afterwards: <q>There shall not be a fornicator among the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and there shall not be an whore among the daughters of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. You shall not offer the hire of an harlot to the Lord your God upon the altar, nor the price of a dog.</q>  <q>For the vows arising from the hire of an harlot are not clean.</q>  These things the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> have forbidden, but they have honoured marriage, and have called it blessed, since God has blessed it who joined male and female together.  And wise Solomon somewhere says: <q>A wife is suited to her husband by the Lord.</q>  And David says: <q>Your wife is like a flourishing vine in the sides of your house; your children like olive-branches round about your table. Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that fears the Lord.</q>  Wherefore <q>marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a></q>  and comely, and the begetting of children pure, for there is no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore neither is the natural purgation abominable before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has ordered it to happen to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> within the space of thirty days for their advantage and healthful state, who do less move about, and keep usually at home in the house. Nay, moreover, even in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with the perpetual purgation of blood  touched the saving border of the Lord's garment in hope of being healed, He was not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at her, nor did complain of her at all; but, on the contrary, He healed her, saying, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has saved you.</q> When the natural purgations do appear in the wives, let not their husbands approach them, out of regard to the children to be begotten; for the law has forbidden it, for it says: <q>You shall not come near your wife when she is in her separation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073327"><a href="../bible/lev018.htm#verse19">Leviticus&nbsp;18:19</a>; <a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse6">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:6</a></span> Nor, indeed, let them frequent their wives' company when they are with child.  For they do this not for the begetting of children, but for the sake of pleasure. Now a lover of God ought not to be a lover of pleasure. </p>
<h3>How Wives Ought to Be Subject to Their Own Husbands, and Husbands Ought to Love Their Own Wives.</h3>

<p>XXXIX . You wives, be subject to your own husbands, and have them in esteem, and serve them with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Sarah honoured <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. For she could not endure to call him by his name, but called him lord, when she said, <q>My lord is old.</q>  In like manner, you husbands, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your own wives as your own members, as partners in life, and fellow-helpers for the procreation of children. For says He, <q>Rejoice with the wife of your youth. Let her conversation be to you as a loving hind, and a pleasant foal; let her alone guide you, and be with you at all times: for if you are every way encompassed with her friendship, you will be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in her society.</q>  Love them therefore as your own members, as your very bodies; for so it is written, <q>The Lord has testified between you and between the wife of your youth; and she is your partner, and another has not made her: and she is the remains of your spirit;</q> and, <q>Take heed to your spirit, and do not forsake the wife of your youth.</q>  An husband, therefore, and a wife, when they company together in lawful marriage, and rise from one another, may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> without any observations, and without washing are clean. But whosoever corrupts and defiles another man's wife, or is defiled with an harlot, when he arises up from her, though he should wash himself in the entire ocean and all the rivers, cannot be clean. </p>

<h2> Section 6 100onclusion of the Work</h2>

<h3>That It is the Custom of Jews and Gentiles to Observe Natural Purgations, and to Abominate the Remains of the Dead; But that All This is Contrary to Christianity.</h3>

<p>XXX . Do not therefore keep any such observances about legal and natural purgations, as thinking you are defiled by them. Neither do you seek after Jewish separations, or perpetual washings, or purifications upon the touch of a dead body. But without such observations assemble in the dormitories, reading the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> books, and singing for the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> which are fallen asleep, and for all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> from the beginning of the world, and for your brethren that are asleep in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and offer the acceptable <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, the representation of the royal body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, both in your churches and in the dormitories; and in the funerals of the departed, accompany them with singing, if they were faithful in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For <q>precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q>  And again: <q>O my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, return unto your rest, for the Lord has done you good.</q>  And elsewhere: <q>The memory of the just is with encomiums.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073334"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse7">Proverbs&nbsp;10:7</a></span> And, <q>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the righteous are in the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073335"><a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse1">Wisdom&nbsp;3:1</a></span> For those that have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although they are asleep, are not dead. For our Saviour says to the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>: <q>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which is written, I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the dead, but of the living; for all live to Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073336"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;3:6</a>; <a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;20:38</a></span> Wherefore, of those that live with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even their very relics are not without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. For even Elisha the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, after he was fallen asleep, raised up a dead man who was slain by the pirates of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.  For his body touched the bones of Elisha, and he arose and revived. Now this would not have happened unless the body of Elisha were <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. And chaste Joseph embraced Jacob after he was dead upon his bed;  and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Joshua the son of Nun carried away the relics of Joseph,  and did not esteem it a defilement. Whence you also, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the rest, who without such observances touch the departed, ought not to think yourselves defiled. Nor abhor the relics of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but avoid such observances, for they are foolish. And adorn yourselves with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, that you may become partakers of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and partners of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, and may receive the promise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and may rest for ever, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Saviour. </p>

<p>To Him, therefore, who is able to open the ears of your hearts to the receiving the oracles of God administered to you both by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and by the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ of Nazareth</a>; who was crucified under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and died, and rose again from the dead, and will come again at the end of the world with power and great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and will raise the dead, and put an end to this world, and distribute to every one according to his deserts: to Him that has given us Himself for an earnest of the resurrection; who was taken up into the heavens by the power of His God and Father in our sight, who ate and drank with Him for forty days after He arose from the dead; who is sat down on the right hand of the throne of the majesty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>; to whom it was said, <q>Sit on my right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool;</q>  whom the most blessed Stephen saw standing at the right hand of power, and cried out, and said, <q>Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> standing at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073341"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse56">Acts&nbsp;7:56</a></span> as the High Priest of all the rational orders,&mdash; through Him, worship, and majesty, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be given to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both now and for evermore.  <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>
