<h1>Apostolic Constitutions (Book VII)</h1>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Concerning the Christian Life, and the Eucharist, and the Initiation into Christ.</strong></p>

<h2>Section 1. On the Two Ways, &mdash; The Way of Life and the Way of Death</h2>

<h3>That There are Two Ways&mdash;The One Natural, of Life, and the Other Introduced Afterwards, of Death; And that the Former is from God, and the Latter of Error, from the Snares of the Adversary.</h3>

<p>I. The lawgiver <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, <q>Behold, I have set before your face the way of life and the way of death;</q>  and added, <q>Choose life, that you may live.</q>  Elijah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> also said to the people: <q>How long will you halt with both your legs? If the Lord be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, follow Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073346"><a href="../bible/1ki018.htm">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;18:21</a></span> The Lord Jesus also said <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>: <q>No one can serve two masters: for either he will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the one, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073347"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;6:24</a></span> We also, following our teacher Christ, <q>who is the Saviour of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, especially of those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073348"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:10</a></span> are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to say that there are two ways&mdash; the one of life, the other of death;  which have no comparison one with another, for they are very different,  or rather entirely separate; and the way of life is that of nature, but that of death was afterwards introduced&mdash;it not being according to the mind of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but from the snares of the adversary.  </p>
<h3>Moral Exhortations of the Lord's Constitutions Agreeing with the Ancient Prohibitions of the Divine Laws. The Prohibition of Anger, Spite, Corruption, Adultery, and Every Forbidden Action.</h3>

<p>II. The first way, therefore, is that of life; and is this,  which the law also does appoint: <q>To <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord God with all your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, who is the one and only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, besides whom there is no other;</q>  <q>and your neighbour as yourself.</q>  And whatsoever you would not should be done to you, do not do to another. <span class="stiki" id="note073355"><a href="../bible/tob004.htm#verse15">Tobit&nbsp;4:15</a></span> <q>Bless them that curse you; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them that despitefully use you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073356"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44</a></span> <q>Love your enemies; for what thanks is it if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you? For even the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> do the same.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073357"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;6:32</a>; <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;5:46-47</a></span> <q>But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, and you shall have no enemy.</q> For says He, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> any man; no, not an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, nor an Edomite;</q>  for they are all the workmanship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Avoid not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but the sentiments, of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. <q>Abstain from fleshly and worldly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.</q>  <q>If any one gives you a stroke on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</q>  Not that revenge is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but that patience is more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>. For David says, <q>If I have made returns to them that repaid me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  <q>If anyone compels you to go one mile, go with him two.</q>  And, <q>He that will sue you at the law, and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073363"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;5:40</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;6:29</a></span> <q>And from him that takes your goods, require them not again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073364"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;6:30</a></span> <q>Give to him that asks you, and from him that would borrow of you do not shut your hand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073365"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;5:42</a></span> For <q>the righteous man is pitiful, and lends.</q>  For your Father would have you give to all, who Himself <q>makes His sun to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and on the good, and sends His rain on the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073367"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> It is therefore reasonable to give to all out of your own labours; for says He, <q>Honour the Lord out of your righteous labours,</q>  but so that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> be preferred.  <q>You shall not kill;</q>  that is, you shall not destroy a man like yourself: for you dissolve what was well made. Not as if all killing were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but only that of the innocent: but the killing which is just is reserved to the magistrates alone. <q>You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>:</q> for you divide one flesh into two. <q>They two shall be one flesh:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073371"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;2:24</a></span> for the husband and wife are one in nature, in consent, in union, in disposition, and the conduct of life; but they are separated in sex and number. <q>You shall not corrupt boys:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073372"><a href="../bible/lev018.htm#verse22">Leviticus&nbsp;18:22</a></span> for this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is contrary to nature, and arose from <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, which was therefore entirely consumed with fire sent from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note073373"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm">Genesis&nbsp;19</a></span> <q>Let such a one be accursed: and all the people shall say, So be it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073374"><a href="../bible/deu027.htm">Deuteronomy&nbsp;xxvii</a></span> <q>You shall not commit fornication:</q> for says He, <q>There shall not be a fornicator among the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073375"><a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy&nbsp;23:17</a></span> <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>:</q> for Achan, when he had stolen in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> at <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned to death</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note073376"><a href="../bible/jos007.htm">Joshua&nbsp;vii</a></span> and Gehazi, who stole, and told a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, inherited the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> of Naaman; <span class="stiki" id="note073377"><a href="../bible/2ki005.htm">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;v</a></span> and Judas, who stole the poor's money, betrayed the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note073378"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;12:6</a></span> and repented, and hanged himself, and burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out; <span class="stiki" id="note073379"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;27:5</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse18">Acts&nbsp;1:18</a></span> and Ananias, and Sapphira his wife, who stole their own goods, and <q>tempted the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>,</q> were immediately, at the sentence of Peter our fellow-apostle, struck dead. <span class="stiki" id="note073380"><a href="../bible/act005.htm">Acts&nbsp;v</a></span> </p>
<h3>The Prohibition of Conjuring, Murder of Infants, Perjury, and False Witness.</h3>

<p>III. You shall not use magic.  You shall not use <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a>; for He says, <q>You shall not suffer a witch to live.</q>  You shall not slay your child by causing <a href="../cathen/01046b.htm">abortion</a>, nor kill that which is begotten; for <q>everything that is shaped, and has received a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if it be slain, shall be avenged, as being <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> destroyed.</q>  <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> the things that belong to your neighbour, as his wife, or his servant, or his ox, or his field.</q> You shall not forswear yourself; for it is said, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> at all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073384"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;5:34</a></span> But if that cannot be avoided, you shall <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>; for <q>every one that swears by Him shall be commended.</q>  <q>You shall not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>;</q> for <q>he that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accuses the needy provokes to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> Him that made him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073386"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse31">Proverbs&nbsp;14:31</a></span> </p>
<h3>The Prohibition of Evil-Speaking and Passion, of Deceitful Conduct, or Idle Words, Lies, Covetousness, and Hypocrisy.</h3>

<p>IV. You shall not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;  for says He, <q>Love not to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, lest you beest taken away.</q> Nor shall you be mindful of injuries; for <q>the ways of those that remember injuries are unto death.</q>  You shall not be double-minded nor double-tongued; for <q>a man's own lips are a strong snare to him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073389"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse2">Proverbs&nbsp;6:2</a></span> and <q>a talkative person shall not be prospered upon earth.</q>  Your words shall not be vain; for <q>you shall give an account of every idle word.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073391"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;12:36</a>; <a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse11">Leviticus&nbsp;19:11</a></span> You shall not tell lies: for says He, <q>You shall destroy all those that speak lies.</q>  You shall not be <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> nor rapacious: for says He, <q>Woe to him that is <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> towards his neighbour with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073393"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse9">Habakkuk&nbsp;2:9</a></span> </p>
<h3>The Prohibition of Malignity, Acceptation of Persons, Wrath, Malice, and Envy.</h3>

<p>V. You shall not be an hypocrite, lest your <q>portion be with them.</q>  You shall not be ill-natured nor <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>: for <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>.</q>  <q>You shall not accept <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in judgment; for the judgment is the Lord's.</q> <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> any man; you shall surely reprove your brother, and not become guilty on his account;</q>  and, <q>Reprove a wise man, and he will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you.</q>  Eschew all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and all that is like it: for says He, <q>Abstain from <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and trembling shall not come near you.</q>  Be not soon <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, nor spiteful, nor passionate, nor <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a>, nor daring, lest you undergo the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of Cain, and of Saul, and of Joab: for the first of these slew his brother Abel, because Abel was found to be preferred before him with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and because Abel's <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was preferred;  the second <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David, who had slain Goliah the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, being <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of the praises of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who danced;  the third slew two generals of armies&mdash; Abner of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Amasa of Judah.  </p>
<h3>Concerning Augury and Enchantments.</h3>

<p>VI. Be not a diviner, for that leads to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>;  for says Samuel, <q>Divination is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073403"><a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;15:23</a></span> and, <q>There shall be no <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> in Jacob, nor soothsaying in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073404"><a href="../bible/num023.htm#verse23">Numbers&nbsp;23:23</a></span> You shall not use enchantments or purgations for your child. You shall not be a soothsayer nor a diviner by great or little birds. Nor shall you learn <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> arts; for all these things has the law forbidden.  Be not one that wishes for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for you will be led into intolerable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. You shall not speak obscenely, nor use wanton glances, nor be a drunkard; for from such causes arise whoredoms and adulteries. Be not a lover of money, lest you <q>serve <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> instead of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073406"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;6:24</a></span> Be not vainglorious, nor <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a>, nor high-minded. For from all these things arrogance does spring. Remember him who said: <q>Lord, my heart is not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a>, nor my eyes lofty: I have not exercised myself in great matters, nor in things too high for me; but I was <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>.</q>  </p>
<h3>The Prohibition of Murmuring, Insolence, Pride, and Arrogance.</h3>

<p>VII. Be not a murmurer, remembering the punishment which those underwent who murmured against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Be not self-willed, be not malicious, be not hard-hearted, be not passionate, be not mean-spirited; for all these things lead to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. But be meek, as were <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and David,  since <q>the meek shall inherit the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073409"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;5:5</a></span> </p>
<h3>Concerning Long-Suffering, Simplicity, Meekness, and Patience.</h3>

<p>VIII. Be slow to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; for such a one is very <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, since <q>he that is hasty of spirit is a very fool.</q>  Be merciful; for <q>blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073411"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;5:7</a></span> Be sincere, quiet, good, <q>trembling at the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073412"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;66:2</a></span> You shall not exalt yourself, as did the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>; for <q>every one that exalts himself shall be abased,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073413"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;18:14</a></span> and <q>that which is of high esteem with man is abomination with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073414"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;16:15</a></span> You shall not entertain confidence in your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for <q>a confident man shall fall into mischief.</q>  You shall not go along with the foolish, but with the wise and righteous; for <q>he that walks  with wise men shall be wise, but he that walks with the foolish shall be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073417"><a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse20">Proverbs&nbsp;13:20</a></span> Receive the afflictions that fall upon you with an even <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and the chances of life without over-much sorrow, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that a reward shall be given to you by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was given to Job and to Lazarus.  </p>
<h3>That It is Our Duty to Esteem Our Christian Teachers Above Our Parents&mdash; The Former Being the Means of Our Well-Being, the Other Only of Our Being.</h3>

<p>IX . You shall <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him that speaks to you the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and be mindful of him day and night; and you shall reverence him,  not as the author of your birth, but as one that is made the occasion of your well-being. For where the doctrine concerning God is, there God is present. You shall every day seek the face of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, that you may acquiesce in their words. </p>
<h3>That We Ought Not to Divide Ourselves from the Saints, But to Make Peace Between Those that Quarrel, to Judge Righteously, and Not to Accept Persons.</h3>

<p>X . You shall not make schisms among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but be mindful of the followers of Corah.  You shall make peace between those that are at variance, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did when he persuaded them to be friends.  You shall judge righteously; for <q>the judgment is the Lord's.</q>  You shall not accept <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> when you reprove for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but do as Elijah and Micaiah did to Ahab, and Ebedmelech the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> to Zedekiah, and Nathan to David, and John to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>.  </p>
<h3>Concerning Him that is Double-Minded and Desponding.</h3>

<p>XI. Be not of a doubtful mind in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, whether it shall be granted or no. For the Lord said to me Peter upon the sea: <q>O you of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, wherefore did you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073424"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;14:31</a></span> <q>Be not ready to stretch out your hand to receive, and to shut it when you should give.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073425"><a href="../bible/sir004.htm#verse31">Sirach&nbsp;4:31</a></span>  </p>
<h3>Concerning Doing Good.</h3>

<p>XII. If you have by the work of your hands, give, that you may labour for the redemption of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for <q>by <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> and acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are purged away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073426"><a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse6">Proverbs&nbsp;16:6</a>; <a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse27">Daniel&nbsp;4:27</a></span> You shall not grudge to give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, nor when you have given shall you murmur; for you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who will repay you your reward. For says he: <q>He that has mercy on the poor man lends to the Lord; according to his gift, so shall it be repaid him again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073427"><a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse17">Proverbs&nbsp;19:17</a></span> You shall not turn away from him that is needy; for says he: <q>He that stops his ears, that he may not hear the cry of the needy, himself also shall call, and there shall be none to hear him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073428"><a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse13">Proverbs&nbsp;21:13</a></span> You shall communicate in all things to your brother, and shall not say <span style="italic">your goods</span> are your own; for the common participation of the necessaries of life is appointed to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You shall not take off your hand from your son or from your daughter, but shall teach them the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God from their youth; for says he: <q>Correct your son, so shall he afford you good hope.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073429"><a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse18">Proverbs&nbsp;19:18</a></span> </p>
<h3>How Masters Ought to Behave Themselves to Their Servants, and How Servants Ought to Be Subject.</h3>

<p>XIII. You shall not command your man-servant, or your maid-servant, who trust in the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with bitterness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, lest they groan against you, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> be upon you from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, you servants, <q>be subject to your masters,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073430"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;6:5</a></span> as to the representatives of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with attention and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <q>as to the Lord, and not to men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073431"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse7">Ephesians&nbsp;6:7</a></span> </p>
<h3>Concerning Hypocrisy, and Obedience to the Laws, and Confession of Sins.</h3>

<p>XIV. You shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> all hypocrisy; and whatsoever is pleasing to the Lord, that shall you do. By no means forsake the commands of the Lord. But you shall observe what things you have received from Him, neither adding to them nor taking away from them. <q>For you shall not add unto His words, lest He convict you, and you become a liar.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073432"><a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse6">Proverbs&nbsp;30:6</a></span> You shall confess your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> unto the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and you shall not add unto them, that it may be well with you from the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who wills not the death of a sinner, but his repentance. </p>
<h3>Concerning the Observance Due to Parents.</h3>

<p>XV. You shall be observant to your father and mother as the causes of your being born, that you may live long on the earth which the Lord your God gives you. Do not overlook your brethren or your kinsfolk; for <q>you shall not overlook those nearly related to you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073433"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;58:7</a></span> </p>
<h3>Concerning the Subjection Due to the King and to Rulers.</h3>

<p>XVI. You shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the king, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that his appointment is of the Lord. His rulers you shall <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as the ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for they are the revengers of all unrighteousness; to whom pay taxes, tribute, and every oblation with a willing mind. </p>
<h3>Concerning the Pure Conscience of Those that Pray.</h3>

<p>XVII. You shall not proceed to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the day of your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, before you have laid aside your bitterness. This is the way of life, in which may you be found, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord. </p>
<h3>That the Way Which Was Afterward Introduced by the Snares of the Adversary is Full of Impiety and Wickedness.</h3>

<p>XVIII. But the way of death  is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> practices: for therein is the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the introduction of many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and disorders, and disturbances; whereby come murders, adulteries, fornications, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjuries</a>, unlawful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rapines, false-witnesses, hypocrisies, double-heartedness, deceit, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, insolence, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, obscene talk, jealousy, confidence, haughtiness, arrogance, impudence, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the good, enmity to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of lies, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of righteousness. For they who do such things do not adhere to goodness, or to righteous judgment: they watch not for good, but for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; from whom meekness and patience are far off, who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> vain things, pursuing after reward, having no pity on the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, not labouring for him that is in misery, nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Him that made them; murderers of infants, destroyers of the workmanship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that turn away from the needy, adding affliction to the afflicted, the flatterers of the rich, the despisers of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, full of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. May you, children, be delivered from all these. </p>
<h3>That We Must Not Turn from the Way of Piety Either to the Right Hand or to the Left. An Exhortation of the Lawgiver.</h3>

<p>XIX . See that no one seduce you  from <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; for says He: <q>You may not turn aside from it to the right hand, or to the left, that you may have understanding in all that you do.</q>  For if you do not turn out of the right way, you will not be ungodly. </p>

<h2>Section 2. On the Formation of the Character of Believers, and on Giving of Thanks to God</h2>

<h3>That We Ought Not to Despise Any of the Sorts of Food that are Set Before Us, But Gratefully and Orderly to Partake of Them.</h3>

<p>XX . Now concerning the several sorts of food, the Lord says to you, <q>You shall eat the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the earth;</q>  and, <q>All sorts of flesh shall you eat, as the green herb;</q>  but, <q>You shall pour out the blood.</q>  For <q>not those things that go into the mouth, but those that come out of it, defile a man;</q>  I mean <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, evil-speaking, and if there be any other thing of the like nature.  But <q>eat the fat of the land with righteousness.</q>  For <q>if there be anything pleasant, it is His; and if there be anything good, it is His. Wheat for the young men, and wine to cheer the maids.</q> For <q>who shall eat or who shall drink without Him?</q>  Wise Ezra  does also admonish you and say: <q>Go your way, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and be not sorrowful.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073445"><a href="../bible/neh008.htm#verse10">Nehemiah&nbsp;8:10</a></span> </p>
<h3>That We Ought to Avoid the Eating of Things Offered to Idols.</h3>

<p>XXI. But abstain from things offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note073446"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:20</a></span> for they offer them in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, that is, to the dishonour of the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may not become partners with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. </p>
<h3>A Constitution of Our Lord, How We Ought to Baptize, and into Whose Death.</h3>

<p>XXII. Now concerning <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>,  O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, we have already given direction, and we now say, that you shall so <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> as the Lord commanded us, saying: <q>Go, and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you):</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073448"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> of the Father who sent, of Christ who came, of the Comforter who testified. But you shall beforehand anoint the person with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil, and afterward <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> him with the water, and in the conclusion shall seal him with the ointment; that the anointing with oil may be the participation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and the water the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the death <span style="italic">of Christ</span>, and the ointment the seal of the covenants. But if there be neither oil nor ointment, water is sufficient both for the anointing, and for the seal, and for the confession of Him that is dead, or indeed is dying together <span style="italic">with Christ</span> . But before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, let him that is to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> fast; for even the Lord, when He was first <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John, and abode in the wilderness, did afterward fast forty days and forty nights.  But He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and then fasted, not having Himself any need of cleansing, or of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, or of purgation, who was by nature pure and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; but that He might testify the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to John, and afford an example to us. Wherefore our Lord was not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into His own passion, or death, or resurrection&mdash; for none of those things had then happened&mdash; but for another purpose. Wherefore He by His own authority fasted after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as being the Lord of John. But he who is to be initiated into His death ought first to fast, and then to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For it is not reasonable that he who has been buried <span style="italic">with Christ</span>, and is risen again with Him, should appear dejected at His very resurrection. For man is not lord of our Saviour's constitution, since one is the Master and the other the servant. </p>
<h3>Which Days of the Week We are to Fast, and Which Not, and for What Reasons.</h3>

<p>XXIII. But let not your <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> be with the hypocrites;  for they fast on the second and fifth days of the week. But do you either fast the entire five days, or on the fourth day of the week, and on the day of the Preparation, because on the fourth day the condemnation went out against the Lord, Judas then promising to betray Him for money; and you must fast on the day of the Preparation, because on that day the Lord suffered the death of the cross under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>. But keep the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and the Lord's day festival; because the former is the memorial of the creation, and the latter of the resurrection. But there is one only <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> to be observed by you in the whole year, which is that of our Lord's burial, on which men ought to keep a fast, but not a festival. For inasmuch as the Creator was then under the earth, the sorrow for Him is more forcible than the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for the creation; for the Creator is more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> by nature and dignity than His own creatures.  </p>
<h3>What Sort of People Ought to Pray that Prayer that Was Given by the Lord.</h3>

<p>XXIV. Now, <q>when you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, be not as the hypocrites;</q>  but as the Lord has appointed us in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, so <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: <q>Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Your name; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth; give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, but deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; for Yours is the kingdom for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q>  Pray thus thrice in a day, preparing yourselves beforehand, that you may be worthy of the adoption of the Father; lest, when you call Him Father unworthily, you be reproached by Him, as <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> once His <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> son was told: <q>If I be a Father, where is my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? And if I be a Lord, where is my <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073453"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse6">Malachi&nbsp;1:6</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of fathers is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of their children, and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of masters is the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of their servants, as the contrary is dishonour and confusion. For says He: <q>Through you my name is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073454"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;52:5</a></span> </p>
<h3>A Mystical Thanksgiving.</h3>

<p>XXXV. Be always thankful, as faithful and honest servants; and concerning the eucharistical thanksgiving say thus:  We thank You, our Father, for that life which You have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us by Jesus Your Son, by whom You made all things, and takest care of the whole world; whom You have sent to become man for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; whom You have permitted to suffer and to die; whom You have raised up, and been pleased to glorify, and hast set Him down on Your right hand; by whom You have promised us the resurrection of the dead. O Lord Almighty, everlasting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, gather together Your Church from the ends of the earth into Your kingdom, as this <span style="italic">grain</span> was once scattered, and is now become one loaf. We also, our Father, thank You for the precious blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, which was shed for us and for His precious body, whereof we celebrate this representation, as Himself appointed us, <q>to show forth His death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073456"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:26</a></span> For through Him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is to be given to You for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Let no one eat of these things that is not initiated; but those only who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into the death of the Lord. But if any one that is not initiated conceal himself, and partake of the same, <q>he eats <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> damnation;</q>  because, being not of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he has partaken of such things as it is not lawful for him to partake of, to his own punishment. But if any one is a partaker through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, instruct him quickly, and initiate him, that he may not go out and despise you. </p>
<h3>A Thanksgiving at the Divine Participation.</h3>

<p>XXVI. After the participation,  give thanks in this manner: We thank you, O God and Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> our Saviour, for Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name, which You have made to inhabit among us; and that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> which You have given us through Your Son Jesus. You, O Almighty Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, hast created the world, and the things that are therein, by Him; and hast planted a law in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and beforehand prepared things for the convenience of men. O God of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blameless fathers, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, Your faithful servants; You, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who art powerful, faithful, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and without deceit in Your promises; who sent upon earth Jesus Your Christ to live with men, as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when He was <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, and man, to take away <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by the roots: even now, through Him, be mindful of this Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, which You have purchased with the precious blood of Your Christ, and deliver it from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and perfect it in Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and gather us all together into Your kingdom which You have prepared. Let this Your kingdom come.  <q><a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the Son of David. Blessed be He that comes in the name of the Lord</q> &mdash; God the Lord, who was manifested to us in the flesh. If any one be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, let him draw near; but if any one be not such, let him become such by repentance. Permit also to your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> to give thanks. </p>
<h3>A Thanksgiving About the Mystical Ointment.</h3>

<p>XXVII. Concerning the ointment give thanks in this manner: We give You thanks, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of the whole world, both for the flagrancy of the ointment, and for the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> which You have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us by Your Son Jesus. For Yours is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the power for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Whosoever comes to you,  and gives thanks in this manner, receive him as a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But if he preach another doctrine, different from that which Christ by us has delivered to you, such a one you must not permit to give thanks; for such a one rather affronts God than glorifies Him.  </p>
<h3>That We Ought Not to Be Indifferent About Communicating.</h3>

<p>XXVIII. But whosoever comes to you, let him be first examined, and then received: for you have understanding, and are able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the right hand from the left,  and to distinguish false teachers from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> teachers. But when a teacher comes to you, supply him with what he wants with all readiness. And even when a false teacher comes, you shall give him for his necessity, but shall not receive his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Nor indeed may you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> together with him, lest you be polluted as well as he. Every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or teacher  that comes to you is worthy of his maintenance, as being a labourer in the word of righteousness. <span class="stiki" id="note073464"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;10:41</a></span> </p>
<h3>A Constitution Concerning Oblations.</h3>

<p>XXIX . All the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the winepress, the threshing-floor, the oxen, and the sheep, shall you give to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note073465"><a href="../bible/num018.htm">Numbers&nbsp;xviii</a></span> that your storehouses and garners and the products of your land may be blessed, and you may be strengthened with grain and wine and oil, and the herds of your cattle and flocks of your sheep may be increased. You shall give the tenth of your increase to the orphan, and to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and to the stranger. All the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of your hot bread, of your barrels of wine, or oil, or honey, or nuts, or grapes, or the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of other things, shall you give to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; but those of silver, and of garments, and of all sort of possessions, to the orphan and to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. </p>
<h3>How We Ought to Assemble Together, and to Celebrate the Festival Day of Our Saviour's Resurrection.</h3>

<p>XXX . On the day of the resurrection of the Lord,  that is, the Lord's day, assemble yourselves together, without fail, giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and praising Him for those mercies God has bestowed upon you through Christ, and has delivered you from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and bondage, that your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> may be unspotted, and acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has said concerning His universal Church: <q>In every place shall <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> and a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> be offered unto me; for I am a great King, says the Lord Almighty, and my name is wonderful among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>.</q>  </p>

Be watchful for your life.  <q>Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning, and you like men who wait for their Lord, when He will come, at even, or in the morning, or at cock-crowing, or at midnight.

<h3>A Prediction Concerning Futurities.</h3>

<p>XXXII.

<h3>A Prayer Declarative of God's Various Providence.</h3>

<p>XXXIII. Our <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Saviour, the King of gods, who alone art almighty, and the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all beings, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blameless fathers, and of those before us; the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and of Isaac, and of Jacob; who art merciful and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy; to whom every heart is naked, and by whom every heart is seen, and to whom every secret thought is revealed: to You do the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the righteous cry aloud, upon You do the hopes of the godly trust, You Father of the blameless, You hearer of the supplication of those that call upon You with uprightness, and who <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the supplications that are not uttered: for Your <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> reaches as far as the inmost parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; and by Your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> You search the thoughts of every one, and in every region of the whole earth the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication is sent up to You. O You who hast appointed this present world as a place of combat to righteousness, and hast opened to all the gate of mercy, and hast demonstrated to every man by implanted <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and natural judgment, and the admonitions of the law, how the possession of riches is not everlasting, the ornament of beauty is not perpetual, our strength and force are easily dissolved; and that all is vapour and vanity; and that only the good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned passes through the midst of the heavens, and returning with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, takes hold of the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>  which is to come. And withal, before the promise of the restoration of all things is accomplished, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself exults in hope, and is joyful. For from that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which was in our forefather <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, when he changed his way You guided him by a vision, and taught him what kind of state this world is; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> went before his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was the consequence of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and the covenant did follow after his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<h3>A Prayer Declarative of God's Various Creation.</h3>

<p>XXXIV. You are blessed, O Lord, the King of ages, who by Christ hast made the whole world, and by Him in the beginning reduced into order the disordered parts; who divided the waters from the waters by a firmament, and put into them a spirit of life; who fixed the earth, and stretch out the heaven, and disposed every creature by an accurate constitution. For by Your power, O Lord, the world is beautified, the heaven is fixed as an arch over us, and is rendered illustrious with stars for our comfort in the darkness. The light also and the sun were begotten for days and the production of fruit, and the moon for the change of seasons, by its increase and diminutions; and one was called Night, and the other Day. And the firmament was exhibited in the midst of the abyss, and You commanded the waters to be gathered together, and the dry land to appear. But as for the sea itself, who can possibly describe it, which comes with fury from the ocean, yet runs back again, being stopped by the sand at Your command? For You have said: <q>Thereby shall her waves be broken.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073484"><a href="../bible/job038.htm#verse11">Job&nbsp;38:11</a></span> You have also made it capable of supporting little and great creatures, and made it navigable for ships. Then did the earth become green, and was planted with all sorts of flowers, and the variety of several trees; and the shining luminaries, the nourishers of those plants, preserve their unchangeable course, and in nothing depart from Your command. But where You bid them, there do they rise and set for signs of the seasons and of the years, making a constant return of the work of men. Afterwards the kinds of the several animals were created&mdash; those belonging to the land, to the water, to the air, and both to air and water; and the artificial wisdom of Your <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> does still impart to every one a suitable <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. For as He was not unable to produce different kinds, so neither has He disdained to exercise a different <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> towards every one. And at the conclusion of the creation You gave direction to Your Wisdom, and formed a reasonable creature as the citizen of the world, saying, <q>Let us make man after our image, and after our likeness;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073485"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> and hast exhibited him as the ornament of the world, and formed him a body out of the four elements, those primary bodies, but had prepared a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> out of nothing, and bestowed upon him his five senses, and set over his sensations a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> as the conductor of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And besides all these things, O Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who can worthily declare the motion of the rainy clouds, the shining of the lightning, the noise of the thunder, in order to the supply of proper food, and the most agreeable temperature of the air? But when man was disobedient, You deprived him of the life which should have been his reward. Yet You did not destroy him for ever, but laid him to sleep for a time; and You by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> called him to a resurrection, and loosened the bond of death, O You reviver of the dead, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who is our hope. </p>
<h3>A Prayer, with Thanksgiving, Declarative of God's Providence Over the Beings He Has Made.</h3>

<p>XXXV. Great are you, O Lord Almighty, and great is Your power, and of Your understanding there is no number. Our Creator and Saviour, rich in benefits, long-suffering, and the bestower of mercy, who does not take away Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from Your creatures: for You are good by nature, and sparest sinners, and invitest them to repentance; for admonition is the effect of Your bowels of compassion. For how should we abide if we were required to come to judgment immediately, when, after so much long-suffering, we hardly get clear of our miserable condition? The heavens declare Your dominion, and the earth shakes with earthquakes, and, hanging upon nothing, declares Your unshaken steadfastness. The sea raging with waves, and feeding a flock of ten thousand creatures, is bounded with sand, as standing in awe at Your command, and compels all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to dry out: <q>How great are Your works, O Lord! In wisdom have You made them all: the earth is full of Your creation.</q>  And the bright host of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the intellectual spirits say to Palmoni,  <q>There is but one <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Being;</q>  and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> seraphim, together with the six-winged <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, who sing to You their triumphal song, cry out with never-ceasing voices, <q>Holy, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, Lord God of hosts! heaven and earth are full of Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073489"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;6:3</a></span> and the other multitudes of the orders, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities, authorities, and powers cry aloud, and say, <q>Blessed be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord out of His place.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073490"><a href="../bible/eze003.htm#verse12">Ezekiel&nbsp;3:12</a></span> But <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, Your Church on earth, taken out of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, emulating the heavenly powers night and day, with a full heart and a willing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sings, <q>The chariot of God is ten thousandfold thousands of them that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>: the Lord is among them in Sinai, in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place.</q>  The heaven <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him who fixed it as a cube of stone, in the form of an arch, upon nothing, who united the land and water to one another, and scattered the vital air all abroad, and conjoined fire therewith for warmth, and the comfort against darkness. The <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of stars strikes us with admiration, declaring Him that numbers them, and showing Him that names them; the animals declare Him that puts life into them; the trees show Him that makes them grow: all which creatures, being made by Your word, show forth the greatness of Your power. Wherefore every man ought to send up an hymn from his very <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to You, through Christ, in the name of all the rest, since He has power over them all by Your appointment. For You are kind in Your benefits, and beneficent in Your bowels of compassion, who alone art almighty: for when You will, to be able is present with You; for Your <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power both quenches flame, and stops the mouths of lions, and tames whales, and raises up the sick, and overrules the power of all things, and overturns the host of enemies, and casts down a people numbered in their arrogance. You are He who art in heaven, He who art on earth, He who art in the sea, He who art in finite things, Yourself unconfined by anything. For of Your majesty there is no boundary; for it is not ours, O Lord, but the oracle of Your servant, who said, <q>And you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in your heart that the Lord your God He is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath, and there is none other besides You:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073492"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse39">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:39</a></span> for there is no God besides You alone, there is none <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> besides You, the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> above all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> beings; for they are sanctified by Your hands.

<h3>A Prayer Commemorative of the Incarnation of Christ, and His Various Providence to the Saints.</h3>

<p>XXXVI. O Lord Almighty You have created the world by Christ, and hast appointed the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> in memory thereof, because that on that day You have made us rest from our works, for the meditation upon Your <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. You have also appointed festivals for the rejoicing of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, that we might come into the remembrance of that wisdom which was created by You; how He submitted to be made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> on our account;  He appeared in life, and demonstrated Himself in His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; how He that appeared is both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; He suffered for us by Your permission, and died, and rose again by Your power: on which account we solemnly assemble to celebrate the feast of the resurrection on the Lord's day, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> on account of Him who has conquered death, and has brought life and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> to light. For by Him You have brought home the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to Yourself for a peculiar people, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and seeing God. For You O Lord, brought our fathers out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and delivered them out of the iron furnace, from clay and brick-making, and redeemed them out of the hands of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, and of those under him, and led them through the sea as through dry land, and bore their manners in the wilderness, and bestowed on them all sorts of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. You gave them the law or decalogue, which was pronounced by Your voice and written with Your hand. You enjoined the observation of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, not affording them an occasion of idleness, but an opportunity of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, for their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Your power, and the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; having limited them as within an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> circuit for the sake of doctrine, for the rejoicing upon the seventh period. On this account was there appointed one week, and seven weeks, and the seventh month, and the seventh year, and the revolution of these, the jubilee, which is the fiftieth year for remission, that men might have no occasion to pretend <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.  On this account He permitted men every <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> to rest, that so no one might be willing to send one word out of his mouth in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> on the day of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> is the ceasing of the creation, the completion of the world, the inquiry after <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and the grateful praise to God for the blessings He has bestowed upon men. All which the Lord's day excels,  and shows the Mediator Himself, the Provider, the Lawgiver, the Cause of the resurrection, the First-born of the whole creation, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, and man, who was born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> alone, without a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who lived holily, who was crucified under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, and died, and rose again from the dead. So that the Lord's day commands us to offer unto You, O Lord, thanksgiving for all.  For this is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> afforded by You, which on account of its greatness has obscured all other blessings. </p>

<h3>A Prayer for the Assistance of the Righteous.</h3>

<p>XXXVIII. We give You thanks for all things, O Lord Almighty, that You have not taken away Your mercies and Your compassions from us; but in every succeeding generation You save, and deliver, and assist, and protect: for You assisted in the days of Enos and <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, in the days of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Joshua, in the days of the judges, in the days of Samuel and of Elijah and of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, in the days of David and of the kings, in the days of Esther and Mordecai, in the days of Judith, in the days of Judas Maccabeus and his brethren, and in our days have You assisted us by Your great High Priest, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Your Son. For He has delivered us from the sword, and has freed us from famine, and sustained us; has delivered us from sickness, has preserved us from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tongue. For all which things do we give You thanks through Christ, who has given us an articulate voice to confess withal, and added to it a suitable tongue as an instrument to modulate withal, and a proper taste, and a suitable touch, and a sight for <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, and the hearing of sounds, and the smelling of vapours, and hands for work, and feet for walking. And You form all these members from a little drop in the womb; and after the formation You bestow on it an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and produce it into the light as a rational creature, even man. You have instructed him by Your <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, improved him by Your statutes; and when You bring on a dissolution for a while, You have promised a resurrection. Wherefore what life is sufficient, what length of ages will be long enough, for men to be thankful? To do it worthily it is impossible, but to do it according to our ability is just and right. For You have delivered us from the impiety of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, and from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the murderers of Christ; You have delivered us from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; You have sent Christ among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, being the only begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; You have made the Comforter to inhabit among us; You have set <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> over us; You have put the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to shame; You have brought us into being when we were not. You take care of us when made; You measure out life to us; You afford us food; You have promised repentance. Glory and worship be to You for all these things, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,  now and ever, and through all ages. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Meditate on these things, brethren; and the Lord be With you upon earth, and in the kingdom of His Father, who both sent Him, and has <q>delivered us by Him from the bondage of corruption into His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> liberty;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073526"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;8:21</a></span> and has promised life to those who through Him have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the whole world. </p>

<h2>Section 3. On the Instruction of Catechumens, and Their Initiation into Baptism</h2>

<p>Now, after what manner those ought to live that are initiated into Christ, and what thanksgivings they ought to send up to God through Christ, has been said in the foregoing directions. But it is reasonable not to leave even those who are not yet initiated without assistance. </p>
<h3>How the Catechumens are to Be Instructed in the Elements.</h3>

<p>XXXIX . Let him, therefore, who is to be taught the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in regard to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> be instructed before his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the unbegotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the understanding of His only begotten Son, in the assured acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Let him learn the order of the several parts of the creation, the series of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, the different dispensations of Your <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Let him be instructed why the world was made, and why man was appointed to be a citizen therein; let him also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his own nature, of what sort it is; let him be taught how God punished the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> with water and fire, and did glorify the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in every generation&mdash; I mean Seth, and Enos, and <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and his posterity, and <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>, and Job, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and Joshua, and Caleb, and Phineas the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and those that were <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in every generation; and how God still took care of and did not reject <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, but called them from their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and vanity to the acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> at various seasons, reducing them from bondage and impiety unto liberty and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, from <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to righteousness, from death <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> to everlasting life. Let him that offers himself to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> learn these and the like things during the time that he is a catechumen; and let him who lays his hands upon him adore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Lord of the whole world, and thank Him for His creation, for His sending Christ His only begotten Son, that He might save man by blotting out his transgressions, and that He might remit ungodliness and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and might <q>purify him from all filthiness of flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073527"><a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:1</a></span> and sanctify man according to the good pleasure of His kindness, that He might inspire him with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and enlighten the eyes of his heart to consider of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>, and make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him the judgments of righteousness, that so he might <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> every way of iniquity, and walk in the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that he might be thought worthy of the laver of regeneration, to the adoption of sons, which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that <q>being planted together in the likeness of the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073528"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;6:5</a></span> in hopes of a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> communication, he may be mortified to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and may live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and word, and deed, and may be numbered together in the book of the living. And after this thanksgiving, let him instruct him in the doctrines concerning our Lord's <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, and in those concerning His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, and resurrection from the dead, and assumption. </p>
<h3>A Constitution How the Catechumens are to Be Blessed by the Priests in Their Initiation, and What Things are to Be Taught Them.</h3>

<p>XL . And when it remains that the catechumen is to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, let him learn what concerns the renunciation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and the joining himself with Christ; for it is fit that he should first abstain from things contrary, and then be admitted to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. He must beforehand purify his heart from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of disposition, from all spot and wrinkle, and then partake of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things; for as the skilfullest husbandman does first purge his ground of the thorns which are grown up therein, and does then sow his wheat, so ought you also to take away all impiety from them, and then to sow the seeds of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in them, and vouchsafe them <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For even our Lord did in this manner exhort us, saying first, <q>Make <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of all nations;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073529"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> and then He adds this, <q>and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them into the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> Let, therefore, the candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> declare thus in his renunciation: &mdash; </p>
<h3>The Renunciation of the Adversary, and the Dedication to the Christ of God.</h3>

<p>XLI. I renounce <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and his works, and his pomps, and his worships, and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and his inventions, and all things that are under him. And after his renunciation let him in his consociation say: And I associate myself to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and am <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into one unbegotten Being, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God Almighty, the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Creator and Maker of all things, from whom are all things; and into the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, His only begotten Son, the First-born of the whole creation, who before the ages was begotten by the good pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by whom all things were made, both those in heaven and those on earth, visible and invisible; who in the last days descended from heaven, and took flesh, and was born of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin Mary, and did converse holily according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of His God and Father, and was crucified under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, and died for us, and rose again from the dead after His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> the third day, and ascended into the heavens, and sits at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and again is to come at the end of the world with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to judge the quick and the dead, of whose kingdom there shall be no end. And I am <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, that is, the Comforter, who wrought in all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> from the beginning of the world, but was afterwards sent to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, according to the promise of our Saviour and Lord, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; and after the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, to all those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; into the resurrection of the flesh, and into the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and into the life of the world to come. And after this vow, he comes in order to the anointing with oil. </p>
<h3>A Thanksgiving Concerning the Anointing with the Mystical Oil.</h3>

<p>XLII. Now this is blessed by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the first preparation for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For he calls thus upon the unbegotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the King of all sensible and intelligible natures, that He would sanctify the oil in the name of the Lord Jesus, and impart to it spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and efficacious strength, the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the first preparation for the confession of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that so the candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, when he is anointed may be freed from all ungodliness, and may become worthy of initiation, according to the command of the Only-begotten. </p>
<h3>A Thanksgiving Concerning the Mystical Water.</h3>

<p>XLIII. After this he comes to the water, and blesses and glorifies the Lord God Almighty, the Father of the only begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> returns thanks that He has sent His Son to become man on our account, that He might save us; that He has permitted that He should in all things become <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of that <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, to preach the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the resurrection of the dead. Moreover, he adores the only begotten God Himself, after His Father, and for Him, giving Him thanks that He undertook to die for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, the type of which He has appointed to be the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of regeneration. He glorifies Him also, for that God who is the Lord of the whole world, in the name of Christ and by His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, has not cast off <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> but has suited His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> to the difference of seasons: at first giving to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> himself paradise for an habitation of pleasure, and afterwards giving a command on account of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and casting out the offender <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, but through His goodness not utterly casting him off, but instructing his posterity in succeeding ages after various manners; on whose account, in the conclusion of the world, He has sent His Son to become man for man's sake, and to undergo all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Him, therefore, let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> even now call upon in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and let him say: Look down from heaven, and sanctify this water, and give it <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and power, that so he that is to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, according to the command of Your Christ, may be crucified with Him, and may die with Him, and may be buried with Him, and may rise with Him to the adoption which is in Him, that he may be dead to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and live to righteousness. And after this, when he has <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> him in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he shall anoint him with ointment, and shall add as follows:&mdash; </p>
<h3>A Thanksgiving Concerning the Mystical Ointment.</h3>

<p>XLIV. O Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is  without generation, and without a superior, the Lord of the whole world, who has scattered the sweet odour of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> among all nations, grant at this time that this ointment may be efficacious upon him that is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that so the sweet odour of Your Christ may continue upon him firm and fixed; and that now he has died with Him, he may arise and live with Him. Let him say these and the like things, for this is the efficacy of the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> on every one; for unless there be such a recital made by a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> over every one of these, the candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does only descend into the water as do the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and he only puts off the filth of the body, not the filth of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. After this let him stand up, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which the Lord taught us. But, of necessity, he who is risen again ought to stand up and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, because he that is raised up stands upright. Let him, therefore, who has been dead with Christ, and is raised up with Him, stand up. But let him <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> towards the east.  For this also is written in the second book of the Chronicles, that after the temple of the Lord was finished by King Solomon, in the very feast of dedication the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> and the singers stood up towards the east, praising and thanking God with cymbals and psalteries, and saying, <q>Praise the Lord, for He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for His mercy endures for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073533"><a href="../bible/2ch005.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;5:13</a></span> </p>
<h3>A Prayer for the New Fruits.</h3>

<p>XLV. But let him <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> thus after the foregoing <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and say: O God Almighty, the Father of Your Christ, Your only begotten Son, give me a body undefiled, a heart pure, a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> watchful, an unerring <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the influence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> for the obtaining and assured enjoying of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, through Your Christ, by whom  <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be to You, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. We have thought it reasonable to make these constitutions concerning the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. </p>

<h2>Section 4. Enumeration Ordained by Apostles</h2>

<h3>Who Were They that the Holy Apostles Sent and Ordained?</h3>

<p>XLVI. Now concerning those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> which have been ordained in our lifetime, we let you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are these:&mdash; James the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem, the brother of our Lord;  upon whose death the second was Simeon the son of Cleopas; after whom the third was Judas the son of James.
