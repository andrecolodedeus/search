<p><strong>Concerning Gifts, and Ordinations, and the Ecclesiastical Canons.</strong></p>

<h2>Section 1. On the Diversity of Spiritual Gifts</h2>

<h3>On Whose Account the Powers of Miracles are Performed.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">I. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></span>, our God and Saviour, delivered to us the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness, and called both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to the acknowledgment of the one and only  <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God His Father,  as Himself somewhere says, when He was giving thanks for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those that had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, <q>I have manifested Your name to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, I have finished the work You gave me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073553"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;17:6,&nbsp;4</a></span> and said concerning us to His Father, <q>Holy Father, although the world has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> You, yet have I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> You; and these have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> You.</q>  With good reason did He say to all of us together, when we were perfected concerning those gifts which were given from Him by the Spirit: <q>Now these signs shall follow them that have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in my name: they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall by no means hurt them: they shall lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073555"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse17">Mark&nbsp;16:17-18</a></span> These gifts were first bestowed on us the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> when we were about to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to every creature, and afterwards were of necessity afforded to those who had by our means <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; not for the advantage of those who perform them, but for the conviction of the unbelievers, that those whom the word did not persuade, the power of signs might put to shame: for signs are not for us who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but for the unbelievers, both for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For neither is it any profit to us to cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but to those who are so cleansed by the power of the Lord; as the Lord  Himself somewhere instructs us, and shows, saying: <q>Rejoice not because the spirits are subject unto you; but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, because your names are written in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073557"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;10:20</a></span> Since the former is done by His power, but this by our good disposition and diligence, yet (it is manifest) by His assistance. It is not therefore necessary that every one of the faithful should cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or raise the dead, or speak with tongues; but such a one only who is vouchsafed this gift, for some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which may be advantage to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the unbelievers, who are often put to shame, not with the demonstration of the world, but by the power of the signs; that is, such as are worthy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: for all the ungodly are not affected by wonders; and hereof God Himself is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, as when He says in the law: <q>With other tongues will I speak to this people, and with other lips, and yet will they by no means <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073558"><a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;28:11</a>; <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:21</a></span> For neither did the Egyptians <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had done so many signs and wonders;  nor did the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who yet had healed every sickness and every disease among them.  Nor were the former shamed by the rod which was turned into a living serpent, nor by the hand which was made white with <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, nor by the river Nile turned into blood; nor the latter by the blind who recovered their sight, nor by the lame who walked, nor by the dead who were raised.  The one was resisted by Jannes and Jambres, the other by <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>.  Thus signs do not shame all into belief, but only those of a good disposition; for whose sake also it is that God is pleased, as a wise steward of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, to appoint <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> to be wrought, not by the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but by His own will. Now we say these things, that those who have received such gifts may not exalt themselves against those who have not received them; such gifts, we mean, as are for the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. For otherwise there is no man who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in God through Christ,  that has not received some spiritual gift: for this very thing, having been delivered from the impiety of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, and having <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father through Christ,  this is a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the having cast off the veil of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, and having <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that, by the good pleasure of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His only begotten Son, who was before all ages,  was in the last time born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>,  without the company of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and that He lived as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and fulfilled all that righteousness which is of the law; and that, by the permission of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He who was <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> endured the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and despised the shame; and that He died, and was buried, and rose within three days; and that after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, having continued forty days with His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and completed His whole constitutions, He was taken up in their sight to His God and Father, who sent Him: he who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> these things, not at random and irrationally, but with judgment and full assurance, has received the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So also has He who is delivered from every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Let not, therefore, any one that works signs and wonders judge any one of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who is not vouchsafed the same: for the gifts of God which are bestowed by Him through Christ are various; and one man receives one gift, and another another. For perhaps one has the word of wisdom, and another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>;  another, discerning of spirits; another, foreknowledge of things to come; another, the word of teaching; another, long-suffering; another, continence according to the law: for even <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he wrought signs in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, did not exalt himself against his equals: and when he was called a god, he did not arrogantly despise his own <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>.  Nor did Joshua the son of Nun, who was the leader of the people after him, though in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Jebusites he had made the sun stand still over against Gibeon, and the moon over against the valley of Ajalon,  because the day was not long enough for their victory, insult over Phineas or Caleb. Nor did Samuel, who had done so many surprising things, disregard David the beloved of God: yet they were both <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the one was <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and the other was king. And when there were only seven thousand <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> who had not bowed the knee to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note073570"><a href="../bible/1ki019.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;19:18</a>; <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;11:4</a></span> Elijah alone among them, and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> Elisha, were workers of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Yet neither did Elijah despise Obadiah the steward, who feared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but wrought no signs; nor did Elisha despise his own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> when he trembled at the enemies. <span class="stiki" id="note073571"><a href="../bible/2ki006.htm">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;vi</a></span> Moreover, neither did the wise Daniel who was twice delivered from the mouths of the lions, nor the three children who were delivered from the furnace of fire,  despise the rest of their fellow <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>: for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they had not escaped these terrible miseries by their own might; but by the power of God did they both work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and were delivered from miseries. Wherefore let none of you exalt himself against his brother, though he be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, or though he be a worker of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>: for if it happens that there be no longer an unbeliever, all the power of signs will thenceforwards be superfluous. For to be <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> is from any one's good disposition; but to work wonders is from the power of Him that works them by us: the first of which respects ourselves; but the second respects God that works them, for the reasons which we have already mentioned. Wherefore neither let a king despise his officers that are under him, nor the rulers those who are subject. For where there are none to be ruled over, rulers are superfluous; and where there are no officers, the kingdom will not stand. Moreover, let not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be exalted against his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> against the people: for the subsistence of the congregation depends on each other. For the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> are the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with relation to the people; and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> are the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> with relation to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. And to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is in our own power; but to be an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or in any other such office, is not in our own power, but at the disposal of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who bestows the gifts. And thus much concerning those who are vouchsafed gifts and dignities. </p>
<h3>Concerning Unworthy Bishops and Presbyters.</h3>

<p>II. We add, in the next place, that neither is every one that prophesies <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, nor every one that casts out devils religious: for even Balaam the son of Beor the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> did prophesy,  though he was himself ungodly; as also did <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, the falsely-named <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.  Nay, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> foretells many things, and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, about Him; and yet for all that, there is not a spark of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in them: for they are oppressed with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, by reason of their <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. It is manifest, therefore, that the ungodly, although they prophesy, do not by their prophesying cover their own impiety; nor will those who cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> be sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> being made subject to them: for they only mock one another, as they do who play childish tricks for mirth, and destroy those who give heed to them. For neither is a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> king any longer a king, but a tyrant; nor is a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> oppressed with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called, being not one sent out by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by men, as Ananiah and Sam&oelig;ah in Jerusalem, and Zedekiah and Achiah the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.  And indeed Balaam the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, when he had corrupted <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by Baal-peor, suffered punishment;  and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> at last was his own murderer; and the sons of Sceva, endeavouring to cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, were wounded by them, and fled away in an unseemly manner;  and the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and of Judah, when they became impious, suffered all sorts of punishments. It is therefore evident how <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, also <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called, will not escape the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it will be said to them even now: <q>O you <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that despise my name,  I will deliver you up to the slaughter, as I did Zedekiah and Achiah, whom the king of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> fried in a frying-pan,</q> as says <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>.  We say these things, not in contempt of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> prophecies, for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are wrought in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men by the inspiration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to put a stop to the boldness of vainglorious men; and add this withal, that from such as these God takes away His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: for <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, but gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>.</q>  Now Silas and <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a> prophesied in our times;  yet did they not equal themselves to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, nor did they exceed their own measures though they were beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> prophesied also. Of old, Miriam the sister of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note073582"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;15:20</a></span> and after her Deborah, <span class="stiki" id="note073583"><a href="../bible/jdg004.htm#verse4">Judges&nbsp;4:4</a></span> and after these Huldah <span class="stiki" id="note073584"><a href="../bible/2ki022.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;22:14</a></span> and Judith <span class="stiki" id="note073585"><a href="../bible/jth008.htm">Judith&nbsp;8</a></span> &mdash; the former under Josiah, the latter under Darius. The mother of the Lord did also prophesy, and her kinswoman <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a>, and Anna;  and in our time the daughters of Philip; <span class="stiki" id="note073587"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse9">Acts&nbsp;21:9</a></span> yet were not these elated against their husbands, but preserved their own measures.  Wherefore if among you also there be a man or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and such a one obtains any gift, let him be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, that God may be pleased with him. For says He: <q>Upon whom will I look, but upon him that is <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and quiet, and trembles at my words?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073589"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;66:2</a></span> </p>

<h2>Section 2. Election and Ordination of Bishops: Form of Service on Sundays</h2>

<h3>That to Make Constitutions About the Offices to Be Performed in the Churches is of Great Consequence.</h3>

<p>III. We have now finished the first part of this discourse concerning gifts, whatever they be, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has bestowed upon men according to His own will; and how He rebuked the ways of those who either attempted to speak lies, or were moved by the spirit of the adversary; and that God often employed the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>  for <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and the performance of wonders. But now our discourse hastens as to the principal part, that is, the constitution of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, that so, when you have learned this constitution from us, you who are ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by us at the command of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, may perform all things according to the commands delivered you, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he that hears us hears Christ, and he that hears Christ hears His God and Father, <span class="stiki" id="note073591"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;10:16</a></span> to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>
<h3>Concerning Ordinations.</h3>

<p>IV.

For You are He who framed the heaven as an arch, and <q>stretch it out like the covering of a tent,</q>  and founded the earth upon nothing by Your mere will; who fixed the firmament, and prepare the night and the day; who brought the light out of Your treasures, and on its departure brought on darkness, for the rest of the living creatures that move up and down in the world; who appointed the sun in heaven to rule over the day, and the moon to rule over the night, and inscribed in heaven the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of stars to praise Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> majesty; who made the water for drink and for cleansing, the air in which we live for respiration and the affording of sounds, by the means of the tongue, which strikes the air, and the hearings which co-operates therewith, so as to perceive speech when it is received by it, and falls upon it; who made fire for our consolation in darkness, for the supply of our want, and that we might be warmed and enlightened by it; who separated the great sea from the land, and rendered the former navigable and the latter fit for walking, and replenished the former with small and great living creatures, and filled the latter with the same, both tame and wild; furnished it with various plants, and crown it with herbs, and beautify it with flowers, and enrich it with seeds; who ordained the great deep, and on every side made a mighty cavity for it, which contains seas of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> waters heaped together, <span class="stiki" id="note073642"><a href="../bible/job038.htm">Job&nbsp;xxxviii</a></span> yet You every way bounded them with barriers of the smallest sand; <span class="stiki" id="note073643"><a href="../bible/jer005.htm#verse22">Jeremiah&nbsp;5:22</a></span> who sometimes raises it to the height of mountains by the winds, and sometimes smooths it into a plain; sometimes enrages it with a tempest, and sometimes stills it with a calm, that it may be easy to seafaring men in their voyages; who encompassed this world, which was made by You through Christ, with rivers, and water it with currents, and moisten it with springs that never fail, and bound it round with mountains for the immoveable and secure consistence of the earth: for You have replenished Your world, and adorned it with sweet-smelling and with healing herbs, with many and various living creatures, strong and weak, for food and for labour, tame and wild; with the noises of creeping things, the sounds of various sorts of flying creatures; with the circuits of the years, the numbers of months and days, the order of the seasons, the courses of the rainy clouds, for the production of the fruits and the support of living creatures. You have also appointed the station of the winds, which blow when commanded by You, and the multitude of the plants and herbs. And You have not only created the world itself, but hast also made man for a citizen of the world, exhibiting him as the ornament of the world; for You said to Your Wisdom: <q>Let us make man according to our image, and according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowls of the heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073644"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> Wherefore also You have made him of an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of a body liable to dissolution&mdash; the former out of nothing, the latter out of the four elements&mdash; and hast given him as to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rational <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the discerning of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and impiety, and the observation of right and wrong; and as to his body, You have granted him five senses and progressive motion: for You, O God Almighty, by Your Christ planted a paradise in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note073645"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;2:8</a></span> in the east, adorned with all plants fit for food, and introduced him into it, as into a rich banquet. And when You made him, You gave him a law implanted within him, that so he might have at home and within himself the seeds of divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and when You had brought him into the paradise of pleasure, You allowed him the privilege of enjoying all things, only forbidding the tasting of one tree, in hopes of greater blessings; that in case he would keep that command, he might receive the reward of it, which was <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. But when he neglected that command, and tasted of the forbidden fruit, by the seduction of the serpent and the counsel of his wife, You <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> cast him out of paradise. </p>

<p>Yet of Your goodness You did not overlook him, nor suffer him to perish utterly, for he was Your creature; but You subjected the whole creation to him, and granted him liberty to procure himself food by his own sweat and labours, while You caused all the fruits of the earth to spring up, to grow, and to ripen. But when You had laid him asleep for a while, You with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> called him to a restoration again, loosed the bond of death, and promise him life after the resurrection. And not this only; but when You had increased his posterity to an innumerable multitude, those that continued with You You glorified, and those who did <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a> from You You punished. And while You accepted of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of Abel <span class="stiki" id="note073646"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm">Genesis&nbsp;iv</a></span> as of an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> person, You rejected the gift of Cain, the murderer of his brother, as of an abhorred wretch. And besides these, You accepted of Seth and Enos, <span class="stiki" id="note073647"><a href="../bible/sir049.htm#verse16">Sirach&nbsp;49:16</a></span> and translated <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>:  for You are the Creator of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the giver of life, and the supplier of want, and the giver of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and the rewarder of those that observe them, and the avenger of those that transgress them; who brought the great flood upon the world by reason of the multitude of the ungodly,  and delivered righteous <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> from that flood by an ark, <span class="stiki" id="note073650"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:20</a></span> with eight <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the end of the foregoing generations, and the beginning of those that were to come; who kindled a fearful fire against the five cities of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and <q>turned a fruitful land into a <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> lake for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of them that dwelt therein,</q>  but snatched <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> out of the conflagration.

You, O Lord, did not overlook Joseph, but granted him, as a reward of his <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> for Your sake, the government over the Egyptians. You, O Lord, did not overlook the Hebrews when they were afflicted by the Egyptians, on account of the promises made unto their fathers; but You delivered them and punish the Egyptians.  And when men had corrupted the law of nature, and had sometimes esteemed the creation the effect of chance, and sometimes honoured it more than they ought, and equalled it to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, You did not, however, suffer them to go astray, but raised up Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and by him gave the written law for the assistance of the law of nature,  and showed that the creation was Your work, and banished away the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>. You adorned <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and his posterity with the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and punished the Hebrews when they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and receive them again when they returned to You. You punished the Egyptians with a judgment of ten plagues, and divided the sea, and bring the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> through it, and drown and destroy the Egyptians who pursued after them. You sweetened the bitter water with wood; You brought water out of the rock of stone; You rained manna from heaven, and quails, as meat out of the air; You afforded them a pillar of fire by night to give them light, and a pillar of a cloud by day to overshadow them from the heat; You declared Joshua to be the general of the army, and overthrew the seven nations of Canaan by him;  You divided Jordan, and dry up the rivers of Etham;  You overthrew walls without instruments or the hand of man.  For all these things, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be to You, O Lord Almighty. You do the innumerable hosts of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities, authorities, and powers, Your everlasting armies, adore.

But after the law of nature, after the exhortations in the positive law, after the prophetical reproofs and the government of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, when men had perverted both the positive law and that of nature, and had cast out of their mind the memory of the flood, the burning of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, the plagues of the Egyptians, and the slaughters of the inhabitant of Palestine, and being just ready to perish universally after an unparalleled manner, He was pleased by Your good will to become man, who was man's Creator; to be under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, who was the Legislator; to be a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, who was an High Priest; to be a sheep, who was the Shepherd.

<h3>Concerning the Readers&mdash; The Constitution of Matthew.</h3>

<p>XXII.

<h3>Concerning the Confessors&mdash; The Constitution of James the Son of Alpheus.</h3>

<p>XXIII. And I James, the son of Alph&aelig;us, make a constitution in regard to confessors: <span style="italic">A confessor is not ordained; for he is so by choice and patience, and is worthy of great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, as having confessed the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of His Christ, before nations and kings. But if there be occasion</span>, he is to be ordained  either a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. But if any one of the confessors who is not ordained snatches to himself any such dignity upon account of his confession, let the same person be deprived and rejected; for he is not in such an office, since he has denied the constitution of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and is <q>worse than an <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073697"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:8</a></span> </p>
<h3>The Same Apostle's Constitution Concerning Virgins.</h3>

<p>XXIV. I, the same, make a constitution in regard to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>: <span style="italic">A virgin is not ordained, for we have no such command from the Lord;</span> <span class="stiki" id="note073698"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> <span style="italic">for this is a state of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> trial, not for the reproach of marriage, but on account of leisure for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a></span> . </p>
<h3>The Constitution of Lebb&aelig;us, Who Was Surnamed Thadd&aelig;us, Concerning Widows.</h3>

<p>XXV. And I Lebb&aelig;us,  surnamed Thadd&aelig;us, make this constitution in regard to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>: <span style="italic">A <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> is not ordained; yet if she has lost her husband a great while, and has lived soberly and unblameably, and has taken extraordinary care of her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, as Judith</span>  <span style="italic">and </span> <span style="italic">Anna</span> &mdash; <span style="italic">those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>&mdash; let her be chosen into the order of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. But if she has lately lost her yokefellow, let her not be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but let her </span> youth<span style="italic"> be judged of by the time; for the affections do sometimes grow aged with men, if they be not restrained by a better bridle</span> . </p>
<h3>The Same Apostle Concerning the Exorcist.</h3>

<p>XXVI. I the same make a constitution in regard to an exorcist. <span style="italic">An exorcist is not ordained. For it is a trial of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> goodness, and of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through Christ by the inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For he who has received the gift of healing is declared by revelation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is in him being manifest to all. But if there be occasion for him</span>, he must be ordained  <span style="italic">a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a></span> . </p>
<h3>Simon the Canaanite Concerning the Number Necessary for the Ordination of a Bishop.</h3>

<p>XXVII.  And I Simon the Canaanite  make a constitution to determine by how many a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ought to be elected. Let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be ordained by three or two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; but if any one be ordained by one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, let him be deprived, both himself and he that ordained him. But if there be a necessity that he have only one to ordain him, because more <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cannot come together, as in time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or for such like causes, let him bring the suffrage of permission from more <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. </p>
<h3>The Same Apostle's Canons Concerning Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and the Rest of the Clergy.</h3>

<p>XXVIII. Concerning  the canons I the same make a constitution. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> blesses, but does not receive the blessing. He lays on hands, ordains, offers, receives the blessing from <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but by no means from <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> deprives any <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> who deserves deprivation, excepting a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; for of himself he has not power to do that. A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> blesses, but does not receive the blessing; yet does he receive the blessing from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or a fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. In like manner does he give it to a fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. He lays on hands, but does not ordain; he does not deprive, yet does he separate those that are under him, if they be liable to such a punishment. A <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> does not bless, does not give the blessing, but receives it from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>: he does not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, he does not offer; but when a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> has offered, he distributes to the people, not as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but as one that ministers to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. But it is not lawful for any one of the other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to do the work of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. A <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> does not bless, nor perform anything belonging to the office of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, but only is to keep the doors, and to minister to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, on account of decency.

<h3>Concerning the Blessing of Water and Oil&mdash; The Constitution of Matthias.</h3>

<p>XXIX .  Concerning the water and the oil, I Matthias make a constitution. Let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> bless the water, or the oil. But if he be not there, let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> bless it, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> standing by. But if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be present, let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> stand by, and let him say thus: O Lord of hosts, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of powers, the creator of the waters, and the supplier of oil, who art compassionate, and a lover of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, who hast given water for drink and for cleansing, and oil to give man a cheerful and joyful countenance;  do Thou now also sanctify this water and this oil through Your Christ, in the name of him or her that has offered them, and grant them a power to restore health, to drive away diseases, to banish <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and to disperse all snares through Christ our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, with whom <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and worship be to You, and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>
<h3>The Same Apostle's Constitution Concerning First-Fruits and Tithes.</h3>

<p>XXX . I  the same make a constitution in regard to <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. Let all <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> be brought to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>,  for their maintenance; but let all the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> be for the maintenance of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and of those under the trial of poverty. For the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and to those <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> that minister to them. </p>
<h3>The Same Apostle's Constitutions Concerning the Remaining Oblations.</h3>

<p>XXXI. I the same make a constitution in regard to remainders. Those eulogies which remain at the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> distribute them among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, according to the mind of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>: to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; four parts; to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, three  parts; to a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, two  parts; and to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacons</a>, or readers, or singers, or <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, one part. For this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and acceptable in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that every one be honoured according to his dignity; for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the school, not of confusion, but of good order. </p>
<h3>Various Canons of Paul the Apostle Concerning Those that Offer Themselves to Be Baptized&mdash; Whom We are to Receive, and Whom to Reject.</h3>

<p>XXXII. <span style="italic">I also, </span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"> the least of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, do make the following constitutions for you, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, concerning canons</span> . Those that first come to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness, let them be brought to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and let them be examined as to the causes wherefore they come to the word of the Lord; and let those that bring them exactly inquire about their character, and give them their testimony. Let their manners and their life be inquired into, and whether they be slaves or freemen. And if any one be a slave, let him be asked who is his master. If he be slave to one of the faithful, let his master be asked if he can give him a good character. If he cannot, let him be rejected, until he show himself to be worthy to his master. But if he does give him a good character, let him be admitted. But if he be household slave to an <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, let him be taught to please his master, that the word be not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>. If, then, he have a wife, or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has an husband, let them be taught to be content with each other; but if they be unmarried, let them learn not to commit fornication, but to enter into lawful marriage. But if his master be one of the faithful, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he is guilty of fornication, and yet does not give him a wife, or to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> an husband, let him be separated; but if anyone has a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, let him indeed be taught <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, but not received into communion before he be cleansed; yet if death be near, let him be received. If any one be a maintainer of harlots, let him either leave off to prostitute <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, or else let him be rejected. If a harlot come, let her leave off whoredom, or else let her be rejected. If a maker of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> come, let him either leave off his employment, or let him be rejected. If one belonging to the theatre  come, whether it be man or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or charioteer, or dueller, or racer, or player of prizes, or Olympic gamester, or one that plays on the pipe, on the lute, or on the harp at those games, or a dancing-master or an huckster,  either let them leave off their employments, or let them be rejected. If a soldier come, let him be taught to <q>do no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, to accuse no man <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, and to be content with his allotted wages:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073715"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;3:14</a></span> if he submit to those rules, let him be received; but if he refuse them, let him be rejected. He that is guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not to be named, a sodomite, an effeminate person, a magician, an enchanter, an astrologer, a diviner, an user of magic verses, a juggler, a mountebank, one that makes amulets, a charmer, a soothsayer, a fortune-teller, an observer of palmistry; he that, when he meets you, observes defects in the eyes or feet of the birds or cats, or noises, or <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> sounds: let these be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> for some time, for this sort of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is hard to be washed away; and if they leave off those practices, let them be received; but if they will not agree to that, let them be rejected. Let a concubine, who is slave to an unbeliever, and confines herself to her master alone, be received;  but if she be incontinent with others, let her be rejected. If one of the faithful has a concubine, if she be a bond-servant, let him leave off that way, and marry in a legal manner: if she be a free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, let him marry her in a lawful manner; if he does not, let him be rejected. Let him that follows the Gentile customs, or Jewish fables, either reform, or let him be rejected. If any one follows the sports of the theatre, their huntings, or horse-races, or combats, either let him leave them off, or let him be rejected. Let him who is to be a catechumen be a catechumen for three years; but if any one be diligent, and has a good-will to his business, let him be admitted: for it is not the length of time, but the course of life, that is judged. Let him that teaches, although he be one of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, yet, if he be skilful in the word and grave in his manners, teach; for <q>they shall be all taught of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073717"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse45">John&nbsp;6:45</a></span> Let all the faithful, whether men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, when they rise from sleep, before they go to work, when they have washed themselves, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; but if any catechetic instruction be held, let the faithful person prefer the word of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> before his work. Let the faithful person, whether man or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, treat servants kindly, as we have ordained in the foregoing books, and have taught in our epistles.  </p>
<h3>Upon Which Days Servants are Not to Work.</h3>

<p>XXXIII. I Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> do make the following constitutions. Let the slaves work five days; but on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> and the Lord's day let them have leisure to go to church for instruction in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. We have said that the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> is on account of the creation, and the Lord's day of the resurrection. Let slaves rest from their work all the great week, and that which follows it&mdash; for the one in memory of the passion, and the other of the resurrection; and there is need they should be instructed who it is that suffered and rose again, and who it is permitted Him to suffer, and raised Him again. Let them have rest from their work on the Ascension, because it was the conclusion of the dispensation by Christ. Let them rest at Pentecost, because of the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which was given to those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Let them rest on the festival of His birth, because on it the unexpected favour was granted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should be born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>,  for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world.  Let them rest on the festival of Epiphany, because on it a manifestation took place of the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for the Father bore testimony to Him at the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and the Paraclete, in the form of a dove, pointed out to the bystanders Him to whom testimony was borne. Let them rest on the days of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: for they were appointed your teachers <span style="italic">to bring you</span> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and made you worthy of the Spirit. Let them rest on the day of the first  <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Stephen, and of the other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who preferred Christ to their own life.  </p>
<h3>At What Hours, and Why, We are to Pray.</h3>

<p>XXXIV. Offer up your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the morning, at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, the sixth, the ninth, the evening, and at cock-crowing: in the morning, returning thanks that the Lord has sent you light, that He has brought you past the night, and brought on the day; at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, because at that hour the Lord received the sentence of condemnation from <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>; at the sixth, because at that hour He was crucified;  at the ninth, because all things were in commotion at the crucifixion of the Lord, as trembling at the bold attempt of the impious <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and not bearing the injury offered to their Lord; in the evening, giving thanks that He has given you the night to rest from the daily labours; at cock-crowing, because that hour brings the good news of the coming on of the day for the operations proper for the light. But if it be not possible to go to the church on account of the unbelievers, you, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, shall assemble them in a house, that a godly man may not enter into an assembly of the ungodly. For it is not the place that sanctifies the man, but the man the place. And if the ungodly possess the place, avoid it, because it is profaned by them. For as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sanctify a place, so do the profane ones defile it. If it be not possible to assemble either in the church or in a house, let every one by himself sing, and read, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, or two or three together. For <q>where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</q>  Let not one of the faithful <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with a catechumen, no, not in the house: for it is not reasonable that he who is admitted should be polluted with one not admitted. Let not one of the godly <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, no, not in the house. For <q>what fellowship has light with darkness?</q>  Let <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, whether men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who have connections with slaves, either leave them off, or let them be rejected. </p>
<h3>The Constitution of James the Brother of Christ Concerning Evening Prayer.</h3>

<p>XXXV. I James,  the brother of Christ according to the flesh, but His servant as the only begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and one appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem by the Lord Himself, and the Apostles, do ordain thus: When it is evening, you, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, shall assemble the church; and after the repetition of the psalm at the lighting up the lights, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> shall bid <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">energumens</a>, the illuminated, and the penitents, as we have formerly said. But after the dismission of these, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> shall say: So many as are of the faithful, let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. And after the bidding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which is formerly set down, he shall say:&mdash; </p>
<h3>The Bidding Prayer for the Evening.</h3>

<p>XXXVI. Save us, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and raise us up by Your Christ. Let us stand up, and beg for the mercies of the Lord, and His compassions, for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of peace, for what things are good and profitable, for a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> departure out of this life, an evening and a night of peace, and free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and let us beg that the whole course of our life may be unblameable. Let us dedicate ourselves and one another to the living God through His Christ. And let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> add this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and say:&mdash; </p>
<h3>The Thanksgiving for the Evening.</h3>

<p>XXXVII. O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who art without beginning and without end, the Maker of the whole world by Christ, and the Provider for it, but before all  His God and Father, the Lord  of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the King of intelligible and sensible beings; who hast made the day for the works of light, and the night for the refreshment of our infirmity&mdash;for <q>the day is Yours, the night also is Yours: You have prepared the light and the sun,</q> &mdash; do Thou now, O Lord, Thou lover of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and Fountain of all good, mercifully accept of this our evening thanksgiving.  You who has  brought us through the length of the day, and hast brought us to the beginnings of the night, preserve us by Your Christ, afford us a peaceable evening, and a night free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and vouchsafe us everlasting life by Your Christ, through whom <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and worship be to You in  the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. And let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> say: Bow down for the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>. And let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> say: O God of our fathers, and Lord of mercy, who formed man of Your wisdom a rational creature, and beloved of God more than the other beings upon this earth, and gave him authority to rule over the creatures upon the earth, and ordained by Your will rulers and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>&mdash; the former for the security of life, the latter for a regular worship,&mdash; do Thou now also look down, O Lord Almighty, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> Your face to shine upon Your people, who bow down the neck of their heart, and bless them by Christ; through whom You have enlightened us with the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and have revealed Yourself to us; with whom worthy adoration is due from every rational and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nature to You, and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who is the Comforter, for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. And let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> say: <q>Depart in peace.</q> In like manner, in the morning, after the repetition of the morning psalm, and his dismission of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">energumens</a>, the candidates for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and the penitents, and after the usual bidding of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, that we may not again repeat the same things, let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> add after the words, Save us, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and raise us up by Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: Let us beg of the Lord His mercies and His compassions, that this morning and this day may be with peace and without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as also all the time of our sojourning; that He will grant us His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of peace, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> departure out of this life, and that God will be merciful and gracious.

<h3>The Form of Prayer for the First-Fruits.</h3>

<p>XL . We give thanks to You, O Lord Almighty, the Creator of the whole world, and its Preserver, through Your only begotten Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, for the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> which are offered to You, not in such a manner as we ought, but as we are able. For what man is there that can worthily give You thanks for those things You have given them to partake of? The God of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, and of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, who made all things fruitful by Your word, and commanded the earth to bring forth various fruits for our rejoicing and our food; who hast given to the duller and more sheepish sort of creatures juices&mdash; herbs to them that feed on herbs, and to some flesh, to others seeds, but to us grain, as advantageous and proper food, and many other things&mdash; some for our necessities, some for our health, and some for our pleasure. On all these accounts, therefore, are You worthy of exalted <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of praise for Your beneficence by Christ, through whom  <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and worship be to You, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Concerning those that are at rest in Christ: After the bidding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that we may not repeat it again, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> shall add as follows:&mdash; </p>
<h3>The Bidding Prayer for Those Departed.</h3>

<p>XLI. Let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for our brethren that are at rest  in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the lover of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, who has received his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, may forgive him every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and involuntary, and may be merciful and gracious to him, and give him his lot in the land of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> that are sent into the <a href="../cathen/01055a.htm">bosom of Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, with all those that have pleased Him and done His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> from the beginning of the world, whence all sorrow, grief, and lamentation are banished. Let us arise, let us dedicate ourselves and one another to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through that Word which was in the beginning. And let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> say: O  You who is  by nature <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and has no end of Your being, from whom every creature, whether <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> or mortal, is derived; who made man a rational creature, the citizen of this world, in his constitution mortal, and added the promise of a resurrection; who did not suffer <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> and Elijah to taste of death: <q>the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob, who art the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of them, not as of dead, but as of living <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> live with You, and the spirits of the righteous are in Your hand, which no torment can touch;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073735"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;22:32</a>; <a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse1">Wisdom&nbsp;3:1</a></span> for they are all sanctified under Your hand: do Thou now also look upon this Your servant, whom You have selected and received into another state, and forgive him if voluntarily or involuntarily he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and afford him merciful <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and place him in the bosom of the patriarchs, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and of all those that have pleased You from the beginning of the world, where there is no grief, sorrow, nor lamentation; but the peaceable region of the godly, and the undisturbed land of the upright, and of those that therein see, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Your Christ; by whom  <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and worship, thanksgiving, and adoration be to You, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. And let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> say: Bow down, and receive the blessing. And let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> give thanks for them, saying as follows: <q>O Lord, save Your people, and bless Your inheritance,</q>  which You have purchased with the precious blood of Your Christ. Feed them under Your right hand, and cover them under Your wings, and grant that they may <q>fight the good fight, and finish their course, and keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note073738"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:7</a></span> immutably, unblameably, and unreprovably, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Your beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, with whom <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and worship be to You and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>
<h3>How and When We Ought to Celebrate the Memorials of the Faithful Departed, and that We Ought Then to Give Somewhat Out of Their Goods to the Poor.</h3>

<p>XLII. Let the third day of the departed be celebrated with psalms, and lessons, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, on account of Him who arose within the space of three days; and let the ninth day be celebrated in remembrance of the living, and of the departed; and the fortieth  day according to the ancient pattern: for so did the people lament <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and the anniversary day in memory of him.  And let <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> be given to the poor out of his goods for a memorial of him.  </p>
<h3>That Memorials or Mandates Do Not at All Profit the Ungodly Who are Dead.</h3>

<p>XLIII. These things we say concerning the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>; for as to the ungodly, if you give all the world to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, you will not benefit him at all. For to whom the Deity was an enemy while he was alive, it is certain it will be so also when he is departed; for there is no unrighteousness with Him. For <q>the Lord  is righteous, and has loved righteousness.</q>  And, <q>Behold the man and his work.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073744"><a href="../bible/isa062.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;62:11</a></span> </p>
<h3>Concerning Drunkards.</h3>

<p>XLIV. Now, when you are invited to their memorials, do you feast with good order, and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as disposed to intercede for those that are departed. For since you are the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you ought always to be sober, both among yourselves and among others, that so you may be able to warn the unruly. Now the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>The men in power are passionate. But let them not drink wine, lest by drinking they forget wisdom, and are not able to judge aright.</q>  Wherefore  both the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> are those of authority in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> next to God Almighty and His beloved Son.  We say this, not they are not to drink at all, otherwise it would be to the reproach of what God has made for cheerfulness, but that they be not disordered with wine. For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> does not say, Do not drink wine; but what says it? <q>Drink not wine to <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>;</q> and again, <q>Thorns spring up in the hand of the drunkard.</q>  Nor do we say this only to those of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but also to every lay <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, upon whom the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is called. For to them also it is said, <q>Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has uneasiness? Who has babbling? Who has red eyes? Who has wounds without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>? Do not these things belong to those that tarry long at the wine, and that go to seek where drinking meetings are?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073749"><a href="../bible/pro023.htm#verse29">Proverbs&nbsp;23:29-30</a></span> </p>
<h3>Concerning the Receiving Such as are Persecuted for Christ's Sake.</h3>

<p>XLV. Receive those that are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>  on account of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and who fly from city to city, <span class="stiki" id="note073751"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;10:23</a></span> as mindful of the words of the Lord. For, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that though <q>the spirit be willing, the flesh is weak,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073752"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;26:41</a></span> they fly away, and prefer the spoiling of their goods, that they may preserve the name of Christ in themselves without denying it. Supply them therefore with what they want, and thereby fulfil the commandment of the Lord.  </p>

<h2>Section 5. All the Apostles Urge the Observance of the Order of the Church</h2>

<h3>That Every One Ought to Remain in that Rank Wherein He is Placed, But Not Snatch Such Offices to Himself Which are Not Entrusted to Him.</h3>

<p>XLVI. Now this we all in common do charge you, that every one remain in that rank which is appointed him, and do not transgress his proper bounds; for they are not ours, but God's. For says the Lord: <q>He that hears you, hears me; and he that hears me, hears Him that sent me.</q> And, <q>He that despises you, despises me; and he that despises me, despises Him that sent me.</q>  For if those things that are without life do observe good order, as the night, the day, the sun, the moon, the stars, the elements, the seasons, the months, the weeks, the days, and the hours, and are subservient to the uses appointed them, according to that which is said, <q>You have set them a bound which they shall not pass;</q>  and again, concerning the sea, <q>I have set bounds thereto, and have encompassed it with bars and gates; and I said to it, Hitherto shall you come, and you shall go no farther;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073755"><a href="../bible/job038.htm#verse10">Job&nbsp;38:10-11</a></span> how much more ought you not to venture to remove those things which we, according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, have determined for you! But because many think this a small matter, and venture to confound the orders, and to remove the ordination which belongs to them severally, snatching to themselves dignities which were never given them, and allowing themselves to bestow that authority in a tyrannical manner which they have not themselves, and thereby provoke God to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> (as did the followers of Corah and King Uzziah,  who, having no authority, usurped the high-<a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> without commission from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the former were burnt with fire, and the latter was struck with a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> in his forehead); and provoke Christ Jesus to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, who has made this constitution; and also grieve the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and make void His testimony: therefore, foreknowing the danger that hangs over those who do such things, and the neglect about the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and eucharistical offices which will arise from their being impiously offered by those who ought not to offer them; who think the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the high-<a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, which is an imitation of the great High Priest <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our King, to be a matter of sport; we have found it necessary to give you warning in this matter also. For some are already turned aside after their own vanity. We say that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of God (<q>to whom God spoke face to face, as if a man spoke to his friend;</q>  to whom He said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>;</q> to whom He spoke directly, and not by obscure methods, or dreams, or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or riddles)&mdash;this person, when he made constitutions and divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, distinguished what things were to be performed by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a>, what by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and what by the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>; distributing to every one his proper and suitable office in the divine service. And those things which are allotted for the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> to do, those might not be meddled with by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; and what things were allotted to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> might not meddle with; but every one observed those ministrations which were written down and appointed for them. And if any would meddle beyond the tradition, death was his punishment. And Saul's example does show this most plainly, who, thinking he might offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> without the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> Samuel,  drew upon himself a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and a curse without remedy. Nor did even his having anointed him king discourage the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. But God showed the same by a more visible effect in the case of Uzziah, <span class="stiki" id="note073759"><a href="../bible/2ch026.htm">2&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;xxvi</a></span> when He without delay exacted the punishment due to this transgression, and he that madly <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> after the high-<a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was rejected from his kingdom also. As to those things that have happened among us, you yourselves are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of them. For you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> undoubtedly that those that are by us named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, were made by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>; and that by the difference of their names is showed the difference of their employments. For not every one that will is ordained, as the case was in that spurious and counterfeit <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the calves under <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note073760"><a href="../bible/1ki013.htm#verse33">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;13:33</a></span> but he only who is called of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if there were no rule or distinction of orders, it would suffice to perform all the offices under one name. But being taught by the Lord the series of things, we distributed the functions of the high-<a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, those of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and the ministration under them both to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>; that the divine worship might be performed in purity. For it is not lawful for a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, or to give either the greater or the lesser blessing. Nor may a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> perform ordination; for it is not agreeable to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to have this order perverted. For <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of confusion,</q>  that the subordinate <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should tyrannically assume to themselves the functions belonging to their superiors, forming a new scheme of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to their own mischief, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that <q>it is hard for them to kick against the pricks;</q>  for such as these do not fight against us, or against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but against the universal Bishop and the High Priest of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.  High <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> were ordained by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,  the most beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By our Saviour  were we <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, thirteen in number, ordained; and by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> I James, and I Clement, and others with us, were ordained, that we may not make the catalogue of all those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> over again. And in common, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacons</a>, and readers, were ordained by all of us. The great High Priest therefore, who is so by nature, is Christ the only begotten; not having snatched that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to Himself, but having been appointed such by the Father; who being made man for our sake, and offering the spiritual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to His God and Father, before His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> gave it us alone in charge to do this, although there were others with us who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him. But he that believes is not presently appointed a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or obtains the dignity of the high-<a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. But after His ascension we offered, according to His constitution, the pure and unbloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; and ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, seven in number: one of which was Stephen,  that blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, who was not inferior to us as to his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> disposition of mind towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who showed so great <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, as to give his life for Him, and was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned to death</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the murderers of the Lord. Yet still this so great and good a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who was fervent in spirit, who saw Christ on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the gates of heaven opened, does nowhere appear to have exercised functions which did not appertain to his office of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, nor to have offered the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, nor to have laid hands upon any, but kept his order of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> unto the end. For so it became him, who was a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to preserve good order. But if some do blame Philip  our <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and Ananias  our faithful brother, that the one did <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the eunuch, and the other me <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, these men do not understand what we say. For we have affirmed only that no one snatches the sacerdotal dignity to himself, but either receives it from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as Melchisedec and Job, or from the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Wherefore Philip and Ananias did not constitute themselves, but were appointed by Christ, the High Priest of that God to whom no being is to be compared. </p>

<h3>The Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles. </h3>

<p>XLVII .1. Let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be ordained by two or three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. </p>

<p>2. A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> by one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as also a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.  </p>

<p>3. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, otherwise than our Lord has ordained concerning the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, offer other things at the altar <span style="italic">of God</span>, as honey, milk, or strong beer instead of wine, any necessaries, or birds, or animals, or pulse, otherwise than is ordained, let him be deprived; excepting grains of new grain, or ears of wheat, or bunches of grapes in their season.  </p>

<p>4. For it is not lawful to offer anything besides these at the altar, and oil for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> lamp, and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> in the time of the divine oblation. </p>

<p>5. But let all other fruits be sent to the house of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> to him and to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, but not to the altar. Now it is plain that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> are to divide them to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. </p>

<p>6.

If he go on in it, let him be deprived. </p>

<p>7. Let not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> undertake the cares of this world; but if he do, let him be deprived.  </p>

<p>8. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> shall celebrate the holiday of the passover before the vernal equinox with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, let him be deprived.  </p>

<p>9. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or any one of the catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, when the oblation is over, does not communicate, let him give his reason; and if it be just, let him be forgiven; but if he does not do it, let him be suspended, as becoming the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of damage to the people, and occasioning a suspicion against him that offered, as of one that did not rightly offer.  </p>

<p>10. All those of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> that enter <span style="italic">into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> church of God</span>, and hear the sacred Scriptures, but do not stay during <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> communion, must be suspended, as causing disorder in the church. </p>

<p>11. If any one, even in the house, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> with a person excommunicate, let him also be suspended. </p>

<p>12. If any <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> with one deprived as with a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, let himself also be deprived. </p>

<p>13. If any <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> who is suspended, or ought not to be received,  goes away, and is received in another city without commendatory letters, let both those who received him and he that was received be suspended. But if he be already suspended, let his suspension be lengthened, as lying to and deceiving the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. </p>

<p>14. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ought not to leave his own parish and leap to another, although the multitude should compel him, unless there be some good reason forcing him to do this, as that he can contribute much greater profit to the people of the new parish by the word of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; but this is not to be settled by himself, but by the judgment of many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and very great supplication. </p>

<p>15. If any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or any one of the catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, leaves his own parish and goes to another, and, entirely removing himself, continues in that other parish without the consent of his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, him we command no longer to go on in his ministry, especially in case his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> calls upon him to return, and he does not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, but continues in his disorder. However, let him communicate there as a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. </p>

<p>16. But if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with whom they are undervalues the deprivation decreed against them, and receives them as clergymen, let him be suspended as a teacher of disorder. </p>

<p>17. He who has been twice married after his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or has had a concubine, cannot be made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or indeed any one of the sacerdotal catalogue.  </p>

<p>18. He who has taken a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or an harlot, or a servant, or one belonging to the theatre, cannot be either a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or indeed any one of the sacerdotal catalogue. </p>

<p>19. He who has married two sisters, or his brother's or sister's daughter, cannot be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>. </p>

<p>20. Let a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> who becomes a surety be deprived. </p>

<p>21. Let an eunuch, if he be such by the injury of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or his <em>virilia</em> were taken away in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or he was born such, and yet is worthy of episcopacy, be made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. </p>

<p>22. Let not him who has disabled himself be made a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>; for he is a self-murderer, and an enemy to the creation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  </p>

<p>23. If any one who is of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> disables himself, let him be deprived, for he is a murderer of himself. </p>

<p>24. Let a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> who disables himself be separated for three years, for he lays a snare for his own life.  </p>

<p>25. Let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who is taken in fornication, or <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, or stealing, be deprived,  <em>but not suspended; for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says: <q>You shall not avenge twice for the same crime by affliction.</q></em>  </p>

<p>26. In like manner also as to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. </p>

<p>27. Of those who come into the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> unmarried, we permit only the readers and singers, if they have a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to marry afterward.  </p>

<p>28. We command that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who strikes the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> that offend, or the unbelievers who do wickedly, and thinks to terrify them by such means, be deprived, for our Lord has nowhere taught us such things. On the contrary, <q>when Himself was stricken, He did not strike again; when He was reviled, He reviled not again; when He suffered, He threatened not.</q>  </p>

<p>29. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who is deprived <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> for manifest crimes, does venture to meddle with that ministration which was once entrusted to him, let the same person be entirely cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. </p>

<p>30. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> obtains that dignity by money, or even a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, let him and the person that ordained him be deprived; and let him be entirely cut off from communion, as <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> was by <span style="italic">me</span> Peter.  </p>

<p>31. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> makes use of the rulers of this world, and by their means obtains to be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a church, let him be deprived and suspended, and all that communicate with him.  </p>

<p>32. If any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> despises his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and assembles separately, and fixes another altar, when he has nothing to condemn in his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> either as to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> or righteousness, let him be deprived as an ambitious person; for he is a tyrant, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, whoever join themselves to him. And let the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> be suspended. But let these things be done after one, and a second, or even a third admonition from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.  </p>

<p>33. If any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> be put under suspension by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, it is not lawful for any other to receive him, but for him only who put him under suspension, unless it happens that he who put him under suspension die. </p>

<p>34. Do not receive any stranger, whether <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, without commendatory letters; and when such are offered, let them be examined. And if they be preachers of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, let them be received; but if not, supply their wants, but do not receive them to communion: for many things are done by surprise. </p>

<p>35. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of every country ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who is the chief among them, and to esteem him as their head, and not to do any great thing without his consent; but every one to manage only the affairs that belong to his own parish, and the places subject to it. But let him not do anything without the consent of all; for it is by this means there will be unanimity, and God will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by Christ, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. </p>

<p>36. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must not venture to ordain out of his own bounds for cities or countries that are not subject to him. But if he be convicted of having done so without the consent of such as governed those cities or countries, let him be deprived, both the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself and those whom he has ordained. </p>

<p>37. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that is ordained does not undertake his office, nor take care of the people committed to him, let him be suspended until he do undertake it; and in the like manner a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. But if he goes, and is not received, not because of the want of his own consent, but because of the ill temper of the people, let him continue <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but let the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of that city be suspended, because they have not taught that disobedient people better. </p>

<p>38. Let a synod of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> be held twice in the year, and let them ask one another the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; and let them determine the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> disputes that happen&mdash; once in the fourth week of Pentecost, and again on the twelfth of the month Hyperberet&aelig;us. </p>

<p>39. Let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> have the care of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> revenues, and administer them as in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it is not lawful for him to appropriate any part of them to himself, or to give the things of God to his own kindred. But if they be poor, let him support them as poor; but let him not, under such pretences, alienate the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. </p>

<p>40. Let not the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> do anything without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, for it is he who is entrusted with the people of the Lord, and will be required to give an account of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Let the proper goods of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, if he has any, and those belonging to the Lord, be openly distinguished, that he may have power when he dies to leave his own goods as he pleases, and to whom he pleases; that, under pretence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> revenues, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> own may not come short, who sometimes has a wife and children, or kinsfolk, or servants. For this is just before God and men, that neither the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suffer any loss by the not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> which revenues are the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> own, nor his kindred, under pretence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, be undone, or his relations fall into lawsuits, and so his death be liable to reproach.  </p>

<p>41. We command that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> have power over the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for if he be entrusted with the precious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, much more ought he to give directions about goods, that they all be distributed to those in want, according to his authority, by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and be used for their support with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with all reverence. He is also to partake of those things he wants, if he does want them, for his necessary occasions, and those of the brethren who live with him, that they may not by any means be in straits: for the law of God appointed that those who waited at the altar should be maintained by the altar; since not so much as a soldier does at any time bear arms against the enemies at his own charges. </p>

<p>42. Let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who indulges himself in dice or drinking, either leave off those practices, or let him be deprived.  </p>

<p>43. If a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacon</a>, a reader, or a singer does the like, either let him leave off, or let him be suspended; and so for one of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. </p>

<p>44. Let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who requires <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> of those he lends to, either leave off to do so, or let him be deprived. </p>

<p>45. Let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who only <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, be suspended; but if he also permit them to perform any part of the office of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, let him be deprived.  </p>

<p>46. We command that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who receives the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, be deprived: <q>For what agreement is there between Christ and <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>? Or what part has a believer with an <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a>?</q>  </p>

<p>47. If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> rebaptizes him who has had <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or does not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> him who is polluted by the ungodly, let him be deprived, as ridiculing the cross and the death of the Lord, and not distinguishing between real <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and counterfeit ones. </p>

<p>48. If a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> divorces his own wife, and takes another, or one <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> by another, let him be suspended.  </p>

<p>49. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> does not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> according to the Lord's constitution, into the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but into three beings without beginning, or into three Sons, or three Comforters, let him be deprived.  </p>

<p>50. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> does not perform the three immersions of the one admission, but one immersion, which is given into the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let him be deprived; for the Lord did not say, <q>Baptize into my death,</q> but, <q>Go and make <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them into the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> Therefore, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> thrice into one Father, and Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and our constitution by the Spirit.  </p>

<p>51. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or indeed any one of the sacerdotal catalogue, abstains from marriage, flesh, and wine, not for his own exercise, but because he abominates these things, forgetting that <q>all things were very good,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073792"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis&nbsp;1:31</a></span> and that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man male and female,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073793"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> and blasphemously abuses the creation, either let him reform, or let him be deprived, and be cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and the same for one of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>.  </p>

<p>52. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> does not receive him that returns from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but rejects him, let him be deprived; because he grieves Christ, who says, <q>There is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in heaven over one sinner that <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073795"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;15:7</a></span> </p>

<p>54. If any one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> be taken eating in a tavern, let him be suspended, excepting when he is forced to bait at an inn upon the road.  </p>

<p>55. If any one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> abuses his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, let him be deprived; for says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>You shall not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the ruler of your people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073798"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse28">Exodus&nbsp;22:28</a></span> </p>

<p>56. If any one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> abuses a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, let him be separated. </p>

<p>57. If any one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> mocks at a lame, a deaf, or a blind man, or at one maimed in his feet, let him be suspended; and the like for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. </p>

<p>58. Let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> who takes no care of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or people, and does not instruct them in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, be separated; and if he continues in his negligence, let him be deprived.  </p>

<p>59. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, when any one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is in want, does not supply his necessity, let him be suspended; and if he continues in it, let him be deprived, as having killed his brother.  </p>

<p>60. If any one publicly reads in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the spurious books of the ungodly, as if they were <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, to the destruction of the people and of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, let him be deprived.  </p>

<p>61. If there be an accusation against a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> for fornication, or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or any other forbidden action, and he be convicted, let him not be promoted into the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. </p>

If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or indeed any one of the sacerdotal catalogue, eats flesh with the blood of its life, or that which is torn by beasts, or which died of itself, let him be deprived; for this the law itself has forbidden.  But if he be one of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, let him be suspended.  </p>

<p>64. If any one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> be found to fast on the Lord's day, or on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, excepting one only, let him be deprived; but if he be one of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, let him be suspended.  </p>

<p>65. If any one, either of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, enters into a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, let him be deprived and suspended.  </p>

<p>66. If any one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> strikes one in a quarrel, and kills him by that one stroke, let him be deprived, on account of his rashness; but if he be one of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, let him be suspended.  </p>

<p>67. If any one has offered <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> not <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, and keeps her, let him be suspended. But it is not lawful for him to take another to wife; but he must retain her whom he has chosen, although she be poor.  </p>

<p>68. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, receives a second ordination from any one, let him be deprived, and the person who ordained him, unless he can show that his former ordination was from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; for those that are either <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> or ordained by such as these, can be neither <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> nor clergymen.  </p>

<p>69. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or reader, or singer, does not fast the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">fast of forty days</a>, or the fourth day of the week, and the day of the Preparation, let him be deprived, except he be hindered by weakness of body. But if he be one of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, let him be suspended.  </p>

<p>70. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or any other of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or keeps the festivals with them, or accepts of the presents from their festivals, as unleavened bread or some such thing, let him be deprived; but if he be one of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, let him be suspended.  </p>

<p>71. If any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> carries oil into an <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> temple, or into a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or lights up lamps in their festivals, let him be suspended. </p>

<p>72. If any one, either of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, takes away from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church an honeycomb, or oil, let him be suspended, and let him add the fifth part to that which he took away.  </p>

<p>73. A vessel of silver, or gold, or linen, which is sanctified, let no one appropriate to his own use, for it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>; but if any one be caught, let him be punished with suspension.  </p>

<p>74. If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be accused of any crime by credible and faithful <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, it is necessary that he be cited by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and if he comes and makes his apology, and yet is convicted, let his punishment be determined. But if, when he is cited, he does not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, let him be cited a second time, by two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sent to him. But if even then he despises them, and will not come, let the synod pass what sentence they please against him, that he may not appear to gain advantage by avoiding their judgment.  </p>

<p>75. Do not receive an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> in a testimony against a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; nor a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> if he be single. For the law says, <q>In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.</q>  </p>

<p>76. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must not gratify his brother, or his son, or any other kinsman, with the episcopal dignity, or ordain whom he pleases; for it is not just to make heirs to episcopacy, and to gratify <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affections in divine matters. For we must not put the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of inheritance; but if any one shall do so, let his ordination be invalid, and let him be punished with suspension.  </p>

<p>77. If any one be maimed in an eye, or lame of his leg, but is worthy of the episcopal dignity, let him be made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; for it is not a blemish of the body that can defile him, but the pollution of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  </p>

<p>78. But if he be deaf and blind, let him not be made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; not as being a defiled person, but that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs may not be hindered. </p>

<p>79. If any one has a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, let him not be made one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Nay, let him not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; but when he is cleansed, let him be received; and if he be worthy, let him be ordained.   </p>

<p>80. It is not right to ordain him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presently who is just come in from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; or from a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> mode of life: for it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> that he who has not yet afforded any trial of himself should be a teacher of others, unless it anywhere happens by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>.  </p>

<p>81. We have said that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ought not to let himself into public administrations, but to attend on all opportunities upon the necessary affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  Either therefore let him agree not to do so, or let him be deprived. For, <q>no one can serve two masters,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note073821"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;6:24</a></span> according to the Lord's admonition.  </p>

<p>82. We do not permit servants to be ordained into the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> without their masters' consent; for this would grieve those that owned them. For such a practice would occasion the subversion of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. But if at any time a servant appears worthy to be ordained into an high office, such as our Onesimus appeared to be, and if his master allows of it, and gives him his freedom, and dismisses him from his house, let him be ordained.  </p>

<p>83. Let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who goes to the army, and desires to retain both the Roman government and the sacerdotal administration, be deprived. For <q>the things of C&aelig;sar belong to C&aelig;sar, and the things of God to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  </p>

<p>84. Whosoever shall abuse the king  or the governor <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, let him suffer punishment; and if he be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, let him be deprived; but if he be a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, let him be suspended. </p>

<p>85. Let the following books be esteemed venerable and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> by you, both of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Of the Old Covenant: the five books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>&mdash; Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy; one of Joshua the son of Nun, one of the Judges, one of Ruth, four of the Kings, two of the Chronicles, two of Ezra, one of Esther, <span style="italic">one of Judith</span>, three of the Maccabees, one of Job, one hundred and fifty psalms; three books of Solomon&mdash; Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs; sixteen <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And besides these, take care that your young <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> learn the Wisdom of the very learned Sirach. But our sacred books, that is, those of the New Covenant, are these: the four <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; the fourteen Epistles of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; two Epistles of Peter, three of John, one of James, one of Jude; two Epistles of Clement; and the Constitutions dedicated to you the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by me Clement, in eight books; which it is not fit to publish before all, because of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> contained in them; and the Acts of us the Apostles.  </p>

<p>Let these canonical rules be established by us for you, O you <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and if you continue to observe them, you shall be saved, and shall have peace; but if you be disobedient, you shall be punished, and have everlasting <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> one with another, and undergo a penalty suitable to your disobedience. </p>

<p>Now, God who alone is unbegotten, and the Maker of the whole world, unite you all through His peace, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; perfect you unto every good work, immoveable, unblameable, and unreprovable; and vouchsafe to you <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life with us, through the mediation of His beloved Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our God and Saviour; with whom <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be to You, the God over all, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> the Comforter, now and always, and for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>

<p>The end of the Constitutions of the Holy Apostles by Clement, which are the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine.  </p>
