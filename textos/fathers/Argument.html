<h1>Argument</h1>

<p>First, it is necessary to state the argument of the Epistle, then also the matters that are questioned respecting it. What then is the argument? Philemon was a man of admirable and noble character. That he was an admirable man is evident from the fact, that his whole household was of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>,  and of such <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> as even to be called a Church: therefore he says in this Epistle, <q>And to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that is in your house.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phm001.htm#verse2">Philemon 2</a></span> He bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> also to his great <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, and that <q>the bowels of the Saints are refreshed in him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phm001.htm#verse7">Philemon 7</a></span> And he himself in this Epistle commanded him to prepare him a lodging. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phm001.htm#verse22">Philemon 22</a></span> It seems to me therefore that his house was altogether  a lodging for the Saints. This excellent  man, then, had a certain slave named Onesimus. This Onesimus, having stolen something from his master, had run away. For that he had stolen, hear what he says: <q>If he has wronged you, or owes you anything, I will repay you.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 18, 19.) Coming therefore to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and having found him in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and having enjoyed the benefit of his teaching, he there also received Baptism. For that he obtained there the gift of Baptism is manifest from his saying, <q>Whom I have begotten in my bonds.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phm001.htm#verse10">Philemon 10</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> therefore writes, recommending him to his master, that on every account he should forgive him, and receive him as one now regenerate. </p>

<p>But because some say, that it was superfluous that this Epistle should be annexed, since he is making a request about a small matter in behalf of one man, let them learn who make these objections, that they are themselves deserving of very many censures. For it was not only proper that these small Epistles, in behalf of things so necessary, should have been inscribed,  but I wish that it were possible to meet with one who could deliver to us the history of the Apostles, not only all they wrote and spoke of, but of the rest of their conversation, even what they ate, and when they ate, when they walked, and where they sat,  what they did every day, in what parts they were, into what house they entered, and where they lodged &mdash; to relate everything with minute exactness, so replete with advantage is all that was done by them. But the greater part, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the benefit that would result thence, proceed to censure it.</p>

<p>For if only seeing those places where they sat or where they were imprisoned, mere lifeless spots, we often transport our minds there, and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and are excited by it, and become more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>, much more would this be the case, if we heard their words and their other actions. But concerning a friend a man enquires, where he lives, what he is doing, whither he is going: and say, should we not make these enquiries  about these the general instructors of the world? For when a man leads a spiritual life, the habit, the walk, the words and the actions of such an one, in short, all that relates to him, profits the hearers, and nothing is a hindrance or impediment.</p>

<p>But it is useful for you to learn that this Epistle was sent upon necessary matters. Observe therefore how many things are rectified thereby. We have this one thing first, that in all things it becomes one to be earnest. For if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> bestows so much concern upon a runaway, a thief, and a robber, and does not refuse nor is ashamed to send him back with such commendations; much more does it become us not to be negligent in such matters. Secondly, that we ought not to abandon the race of slaves, even if they have proceeded to extreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. For if a thief and a runaway become so <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was willing to make him a companion, and says in this Epistle, <q>that in your stead he might have ministered unto me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phm001.htm#verse13">Philemon 13</a></span>, much more ought we not to abandon the free. Thirdly, that we ought not to withdraw slaves from the service of their masters. For if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who had such confidence in Philemon, was unwilling to detain Onesimus, so useful and serviceable to minister to himself, without the consent of his master, much less ought we so to act. For if the servant is so excellent, he ought by all means to continue in that service, and to acknowledge the authority of his master, that he may be the occasion of benefit to all in that house. Why do you take the candle from the candlestick to place it in the bushel?</p>

<p>I wish it were possible to bring into the cities those (servants) who are without. <q>What,</q> say you, <q>if he also should become corrupt.</q> And why should he, I beseech you? Because he has come into the city? But consider, that being without he will be much more corrupt. For he who is corrupt being within, will be much more so being without. For here he will be delivered from necessary care, his master taking that care upon himself; but there the concern about those things will draw him off perhaps even from things more necessary, and more spiritual. On this account the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, when giving them the best counsel, said, <q>Are you called, being a servant? Care not for it: but if even you may be made free, use it rather</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse21">1 Corinthians 7:21</a></span>; that is, abide in slavery.  But what is more important than all, that the word of God be not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, as he himself says in one of his Epistles. <q>Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, that the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His doctrine be not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 6:1</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also will say, that even one who is a slave can be well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But now many are reduced to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and of saying <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> has been introduced into life for the subversion of everything, masters having their servants taken from them, and it is a matter of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>.</p>

<p>Let me also say one other thing. He teaches us not to be ashamed of our domestics, if they are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. For if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the most admirable of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, speaks thus much in favor of this one, much more should we speak favorably of ours. There being then so many good effects&mdash; and yet we have not mentioned all&mdash; does any one think it superfluous that this Epistle was inserted? And would not this be extreme folly? Let us then, I beseech you, apply to the Epistle written by the Apostle. For having gained already so many advantages from it, we shall gain more from the text. </p>
