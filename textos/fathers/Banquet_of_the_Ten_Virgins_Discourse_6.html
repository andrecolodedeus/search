<h1>Banquet of the Ten Virgins (Discourse 6)</h1>

<p><strong>Agathe</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1. The Excellence of the Abiding Glory of Virginity; The Soul Made in the Image of the Image of God, that is of His Son; The Devil a Suitor for the Soul.</h2>

<p>With great confidence of being able to persuade, and to carry on this admirable discourse, O Arete, if you go with me, will I also endeavour, according to my ability, to contribute something to the discussion of the subject before us; something commensurate to my own power, and not to be compared with that which has already been spoken. For I should be unable to put forth in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a> anything that could compete with those things which have already been so variously and brilliantly worked out. For I shall seem to bear away the reproach of silliness, if I make an effort to match myself with my superiors in wisdom. If, however, you will bear even with those who speak as they can, I will endeavour to speak, not lacking at least in good will. And here let me begin.</p>

<p>We have all come into this world, O <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, endowed with singular beauty, which has a relationship and affinity to <em>divine</em> wisdom. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men do then most accurately resemble Him who begot and formed them, when, reflecting the unsullied representation of His likeness, and the features of that countenance, to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> looking formed them to have an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and indestructible shape, they remain such. For the unbegotten and incorporeal beauty, which neither begins nor is corruptible, but is unchangeable, and grows not old and has need of nothing, He resting in Himself, and in the very light which is in unspeakable and inapproachable places,  embracing all things in the circumference of His power, creating and arranging, made the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after the image of His image. Therefore, also, it is reasonable and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. For being made after the image of the Only-begotten, as I said, it has an unsurpassable beauty, and therefore <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>  <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it, and plot and strive to defile its godlike and lovely image, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah shows, reproaching Jerusalem, <q>You had a whore's forehead, you refused to be ashamed; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note062588"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse3">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:3</a></span> speaking of her who prostituted herself to the powers which came against her to pollute her. For her lovers are the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who plan to defile and pollute our reasonable and clear-sighted beauty of mind by intercourse with themselves, and desire to cohabit with every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The Parable of the Ten Virgins.</h2> 

<p>If, then, any one will keep this beauty inviolate and unharmed, and such as He who constructed it formed and fashioned it, imitating the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and intelligible nature of which man is the representation and likeness, and will become like a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> image, he will be transferred thence to heaven, the city of the blessed, and will dwell there as in a sanctuary. Now our beauty is then best preserved undefiled and perfect when, protected by <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, it is not darkened by the heat of corruption from without; but, remaining in itself, it is adorned with righteousness, being brought as a bride to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; as He also Himself suggests, exhorting that the light of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> should be kindled in their flesh, as in lamps; since the number of the ten <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> s signifies the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, symbolizing by the ten the only right way to heaven. Now five of them were <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> and wise; and five were foolish and unwise, for they had not the forethought to fill their vessels with oil, remaining destitute of righteousness. Now by these He signifies those who strive to come to the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and who strain every nerve to fulfil this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, acting virtuously and temperately, and who profess and boast that this is their aim; but who, making light of it, and being subdued by the changes of the world, come rather to be sketches of the shadowy image of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, than workers who represent the living <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. The Same Endeavour and Effort After Virginity, with a Different Result.</h2>

<p>Now when it is said <span class="stiki" id="note062590"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm">Matthew&nbsp;25</a></span> that <q>the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is likened unto ten <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom,</q> this means that the same way towards the goal had been entered upon, as is shown by the mark X.  By profession they had equally proposed the same end, and therefore they are called ten, since, as I have said, they chose the same profession; but they did not, for all that, go forth in the same way to meet the bridegroom. For some provided abundant future nourishment for their lamps which were fed with oil, but others were careless, thinking only of the present. And, therefore, they are divided into two equal numbers of five, inasmuch as the one class preserved the five senses, which most people consider the gates of wisdom, pure and undefiled by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but the others, on the contrary, corrupted them by multitudes of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, defiling themselves with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For having restrained them, and kept them free from righteousness, they bore a more abundant crop of transgressions, in consequence of which it came to pass that they were forbidden, and shut out from the divine courts. For whether, on the one hand, we do right, or, on the other, do wrong through these senses, our habits of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are confirmed. And as Thallousa said that there is a <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of the eyes, and of the ears, and of the tongue, and so on of the other senses; so here she who keeps inviolate the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the five pathways of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>&mdash; sight, taste, smell, touch, and hearing&mdash; is called by the name of the five <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, because she has kept the five forms of the sense pure to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as a lamp, causing the light of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to shine forth clearly from each of them. For the flesh is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, as it were, our five-lighted lamp, which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will bear like a torch, when it stands before Christ the Bridegroom, on the day of the resurrection, showing her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> springing out clear and bright through all the senses, as He Himself taught, saying,  <q>I have come to send fire on the earth; and what will I if it be already kindled? </q>meaning by the earth our bodies, in which He wished the swift-moving and fiery operation of His doctrine to be kindled. Now the oil represents wisdom and righteousness; for while the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rains down unsparingly, and pours forth these things upon the body, the light of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is kindled unquenchably, making its good actions to shine before men, so that our Father which is in heaven may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note062593"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;5:16</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 4. What the Oil in the Lamps Means.</h2>

<p>Now they offered, in Leviticus, <span class="stiki" id="note062594"><a href="../bible/lev024.htm#verse2">Leviticus&nbsp;24:2-3</a></span> oil of this kind, <q>pure oil olive, beaten for the light, to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the lamps to burn continually, without the veil ... before the Lord.</q> But they were commanded to have a feeble light from the evening to the morning. For their light seemed to resemble the prophetic word, which gives encouragement to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, being nourished by the acts and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the people. But the temple (in which the light was kept burning) refers to <q>the lot of their inheritance,</q>  inasmuch as a light can shine in only one house. Therefore it was necessary that it should be lighted before day. For he says, <span class="stiki" id="note062596"><a href="../bible/lev024.htm#verse3">Leviticus&nbsp;24:3</a></span> <q> <em>they shall burn it</em> until the morning,</q> that is, until the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But the Sun of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and of righteousness having arisen, there is no need of <em>other</em> light.</p>

<p>So long, then, as this people treasured up nourishment for the light, supplying oil by their works, the light of continence was not extinguished among them, but was ever shining and giving light in the <q>lot of their inheritance.</q> But when the oil failed, by their turning away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to incontinence, the light was entirely extinguished, so that the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> have again to kindle their lamps by light transmitted from one to another, bringing the light of incorruption to the world from above. Let us then supply now the oil of good works abundantly, and of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, being purged from all corruption which would weigh us down; lest, while the Bridegroom tarries, our lamps may also in like manner be extinguished. For the delay is the interval which precedes the appearing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now the slumbering and sleeping of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> signifies the departure from life; and the midnight is the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, during which the destroying <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> passes over the houses.  But the cry which was made when it was said,  <q>Behold the bridegroom comes, go out to meet him,</q> is the voice which shall be heard from heaven, and the trumpet, when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, all their bodies being raised, shall be caught up, and shall go on the clouds to meet the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note062599"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:16-17</a></span> </p>

<p>For it is to be observed that the word <em>of God</em> says, that after the cry all the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> arose, that is, that the dead shall be raised after the voice which comes from heaven, as also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> intimates, <span class="stiki" id="note062600"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> that <q>the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first; </q>that is the tabernacles,  for they died, being put off by their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. <q>Then we which are alive shall be caught up together with them,</q> meaning our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.  For we <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> who are alive are the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which, with the bodies, having put them on again, shall go to meet Him in the clouds, bearing our lamps trimmed, not with anything alien and worldly, but like stars radiating the light of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and continence, full of ethereal splendour.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The Reward of Virginity.</h2>

<p>These, O fair <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, are the orgies of our <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; these the mystic <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of those who are initiated in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>; these the <q>undefiled rewards</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062603"><a href="../bible/wis004.htm#verse2">Wisdom&nbsp;4:2</a></span> of the conflict of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. I am <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to the Word, and receive as a reward the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> crown of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and riches from the Father; and I triumph in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, crowned with the bright and unfading flowers of wisdom. I am one in the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> with Christ dispensing His rewards in heaven, around the unbeginning and never-ending King. I have become the torch-bearer of the unapproachable lights,  and I join with their company in the new song of the archangels, showing forth the new <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for the Word says that the company of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> always follow the Lord, and have fellowship with Him wherever He is. And this is what John signifies in the commemoration of the hundred and forty-four thousand. </p>

<p>Go then, you virgin band of the new ages. Go, fill your vessels with righteousness, for the hour is coming when you must rise and meet the bridegroom. Go, lightly leaving on one side the fascinations and the pleasures of life, which confuse and bewitch the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and thus shall you attain the promises, <q>This I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by Him who has shown me the way of life.</q> This crown, woven by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, I have taken from the prophetic meadows, and offer to you, O Arete.</p>

<p>Agathe having thus admirably brought her discourse to an end, she said, and having been applauded for what she had uttered, Arete again commanded Procilla to speak. And she, rising and passing before the entrance, spoke thus.</p>
