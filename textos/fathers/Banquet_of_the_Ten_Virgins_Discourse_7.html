<h1>Banquet of the Ten Virgins (Discourse 7)</h1>

<p><strong>Procilla</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1. What the True and Seemly Manner of Praising; The Father Greater Than the Son, Not in Substance, But in Order; Virginity the Lily; Faithful Souls and Virgins, the One Bride of the One Christ.</h2>

<p>It is not lawful for me to delay, O Arete, after such discourses, seeing that I confide undoubtingly in the manifold wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which gives richly and widely to whomsoever it wills. For sailors who have experience of the sea declare that the same wind blows on all who sail; and that different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, managing their course differently, strive to reach different ports. Some have a fair wind; to others it blows across their course; and yet both easily accomplish their voyage. Now, in the same way, the <q>understanding Spirit,  <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, one only,</q>  gently breathing down from the treasures of the Father above, giving us all the clear fair wind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, will suffice to guide the course of our words without offense. And now it is time for me to speak. This, O <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, is the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and seemly mode of praising, when he who praises brings forward a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> better than all those who are praised. For thence one may learn with certainty that the commendation is given not from favour, nor of necessity, nor from repute, but in accordance with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and an unflattering judgment. And so the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who spoke more fully concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and assigned to Him a divinity above other men, did not refer their praises of Him to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but to Him upon whom all authority and power depend. For it was fitting that He who was greater than all things after the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, should have the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who alone is greater than Himself, <span class="stiki" id="note062608"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span> as His <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. And so I will not bring forward the praises of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> from mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> report, but from Him who cares for us, and who has taken up the whole matter, showing that He is the husbandman of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and a lover of its beauty, and a fitting <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. And this is quite clear, in the Song of Songs,  to any one who is willing to see it, where Christ Himself, praising those who are firmly established in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, says, <span class="stiki" id="note062610"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse2">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:2</a></span> <q>As the lily among thorns, so is my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> among the daughters; </q>comparing the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> to the lily, on account of its purity and fragrance, and sweetness and joyousness. For <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is like a spring flower, always softly exhaling <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> from its white petals. Therefore He is not ashamed to confess that He loves the beauty of its prime, in the following words: <span class="stiki" id="note062611"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:9-12</a></span> <q>You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck. How fair is your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, my sister, my spouse! How much better is your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> than wine! And the smell of your ointments than all spices! Your lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb; honey and milk are under your tongue; and the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon. A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</q></p>

<p>These praises does Christ proclaim to those who have come to the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, describing them all under the one name of His spouse; for the spouse must be <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to the Bridegroom, and called by His name. And, moreover, she must be undefiled and unpolluted, as a garden sealed, in which all the odours of the fragrance of heaven are grown, that Christ alone may come and gather them, blooming with incorporeal seeds. For the Word loves none of the things of the flesh, because He is not of such a nature as to be contented with any of the things which are corruptible, as hands, or face, or feet; but He looks upon and delights in the beauty which is immaterial and spiritual, not touching the beauty of the body.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The Interpretation of that Passage of the Canticles.</h2> 

<p>Consider now, O <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, that, in saying to the bride, <q>You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse,</q> He shows the clear eye of the understanding, when the inner man has cleansed it and looks more clearly upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For it is clear to every one that there is a twofold power of sight, the one of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the other of the body. But the Word does not profess a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for that of the body, but only that of the understanding, saying, <q>You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck; </q>which means, By the most lovely sight of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, you have urged my heart to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, radiating forth from within the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> beauty of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Now the chains of the neck are necklaces which are composed of various precious stones; and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which take care of the body, place around the outward neck of the flesh this visible ornament to deceive those who behold; but those who live chastely, on the other hand, adorn themselves within with ornaments <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> composed of various precious stones, namely, of freedom, of magnanimity, of wisdom, and of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, caring little for those temporal decorations which, like leaves blossoming for an hour, dry up with the changes of the body. For there is seen in man a twofold beauty, of which the Lord accepts that which is within and is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, saying, <q>You have ravished my heart with one chain of your neck; </q>meaning to show that He had been drawn to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by the splendour of the inner man shining forth in its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, even as the Psalmist also testifies, saying, <q>The King's daughter is all <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> within.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Virgins Being Martyrs First Among the Companions of Christ.</h2>

<p>Let no one suppose that all the remaining company of those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> are condemned, thinking that we who are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> alone shall be led on to attain the promises, not understanding that there shall be tribes and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> and orders, according to the analogy of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of each. And this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, too, sets forth, saying, <span class="stiki" id="note062614"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse41">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:41-42</a></span> <q>There is one <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the sun, and another <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the moon, and another <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the stars: for one star differs from another star in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. So also is the resurrection of the dead.</q> And the Lord does not profess to give the same honours to all; but to some He promises that they shall be numbered in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, to others the inheritance of the earth, and to others to see the Father. <span class="stiki" id="note062615"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;5:3-16</a></span> And here, also, He announces that the order and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> shall first enter in company with Him into the rest of the new dispensation, as into a bridal chamber. For they were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, not as bearing the pains of the body for a little moment of time, but as enduring them through all their life, not shrinking from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> wrestling in an Olympian contest for the prize of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; but resisting the fierce torments of pleasures and fears and griefs, and the other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the iniquity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they first of all carry off the prize, taking their place in the higher rank of those who receive the promise. Undoubtedly these are the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> whom the Word calls alone His chosen spouse and His sister, but the rest concubines and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and daughters, speaking thus: <span class="stiki" id="note062616"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse8">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:8-9</a></span> <q>There are threescore queens and fourscore concubines, and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> without number. My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her: the daughters saw her and blessed her: yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</q> For there being plainly many daughters of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, one alone is the chosen and most precious in her eyes above all, namely, the order of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Passage Explained; The Queens, the Holy Souls Before the Deluge; The Concubines, the Souls of the Prophets; The Divine Seed for Spiritual Offspring in the Books of the Prophets; The Nuptials of the Word in the Prophets as Though Clandestine.</h2>

<p>Now if any one should have a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about these things, inasmuch as the points are nowhere fully wrought out, and should still wish more fully to perceive their spiritual significance, namely, what the queens and the concubines and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> are, we will say that these may have been spoken concerning those who have been conspicuous for their righteousness from the beginning throughout the progress of time; as of those before the flood, and those after the flood, and so on of those after Christ. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, then, is the spouse. The queens are those royal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> before the deluge, who became well-pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, those about Abel and Seth and <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>. The concubines  those after the flood, namely, those of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, in whom, before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to the Lord, being united to them after the manner of concubines, He sowed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> words in an incorrupt and pure <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, so that, conceiving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they might bring forth to Him the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For such fruits do the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> bring forth with whom Christ has had intercourse, fruits which bear an ever-memorable renown. For if you will look at the books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, or David, or Solomon, or Isaiah, or of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who follow, O <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, you will see what offspring they have left, for the saving of life, from their intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Hence the Word has with deep perception called the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> concubines, because He did not espouse them openly, as He did the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, having killed for her the fatted calf. <span class="stiki" id="note062619"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;15:23</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The Sixty Queens: Why Sixty, and Why Queens; The Excellence of the Saints of the First Age.</h2>

<p>In addition to these matters, there is this also to be considered, so that nothing may escape us of things which are necessary, why He said that the queens were sixty, and the concubines eighty, and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> so numerous as not to be counted from their multitude, but the spouse one. And first let us speak of the sixty. I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that He named under the sixty queens, those who had pleased God from the first-made man in succession to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, for this reason, since these had no need of precepts and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the creation of the world in six days being still recent. For they remembered that in six days God formed the creation, and those things which were made in paradise; and how man, receiving a command not to touch  the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, ran aground, the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> having led him astray. <span class="stiki" id="note062621"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;3:3</a></span> Thence he gave the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> name of sixty queens to those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> who, from the creation of the world, in succession chose God as the object of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and were almost, so to speak, the offspring of the first age, and neighbours of the great six days' work, from their having been born, as I said, immediately after the six days. For these had great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, being associated with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and often seeing God manifested visibly, and not in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>. For consider what confidence Seth had towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Abel, and Enos, and <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10048b.htm">Methuselah</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, the first lovers of righteousness, and the first of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> children who are written in heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note062622"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse23">Hebrews&nbsp;11:23</a></span> being thought worthy of the kingdom, as a kind of <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the plants for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, coming out as early fruit to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And so much may suffice concerning these.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The Eighty Concubines, What; The Knowledge of the Incarnation Communicated to the Prophets.</h2>

<p>It still remains to speak concerning the concubines. To those who lived after the deluge the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God was henceforth more remote, and they needed other instruction to ward off the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and to be their helper, since <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> was already creeping in. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the race of man might not be wholly destroyed, through forgetfulness of the things whichwere good, commanded His own Son to reveal to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> His own future appearance in the world by the flesh, in which the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the spiritual eighth day  shall be proclaimed, which would bring the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the resurrection, and that thereby the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and corruptions of men would be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>. And, therefore, He called by the name of the eighty <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> the list of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, on account of the dignity of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which embraces the number eight, in accordance with which also the law is framed; because they first, before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was espoused to the Word, received the divine seed, and foretold the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the spiritual eighth day.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Virgins, the Righteous Ancients; The Church, the One Only Spouse, More Excellent Than the Others.</h2> 

<p>Now he calls by the name of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, who belong to a countless assembly, those who, being inferior to the better ones, have practised righteousness, and have striven against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with youthful and noble energy. But of these, neither the queens, nor the concubines, nor the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, are compared to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For she is reckoned the perfect and chosen one beyond all these, consisting and composed of all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, the Bride who surpasses all in the beauty of youth and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Therefore, also, she is blessed and praised by all, because she saw and heard freely what those desired to see, even for a little time, and saw not, and to hear, but heard not. For <q>blessed,</q> said our Lord to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note062625"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;13:16-17</a></span> <q>are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. For verily I say unto you, That many <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them.</q> For this reason, then, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> count them blessed, and admire them, because the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was thought worthy to participate in those things which they did not attain to hear or see. For <q>there are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> without number. My dove, my undefiled, is but one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062626"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse8">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:8-9</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8. The Human Nature of Christ His One Dove.</h2>

<p>Can any one now say otherwise than that the Bride is the undefiled flesh of the Lord, for the sake of which He left the Father and came down here, and was joined to it, and, being incarnate, dwelt in it? Therefore He called it figuratively a dove, because that creature is tame and domestic, and readily adapts itself to man's mode of life. For she alone, so to speak, was found spotless and undefiled, and excelling all in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and beauty of righteousness, so that none of those who had pleased God most perfectly could stand near to her in a comparison of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And for this reason she was thought worthy to become a partaker of the kingdom of the Only-begotten, being <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> and united to Him. And in the forty-fourth psalm,  the queen who, chosen out of many, stands at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, clothed in the golden ornament of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whose beauty the King desired,  is, as I said, the undefiled and blessed flesh, which the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself carried into the heavens, and presented at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>wrought about with various colours,</q> that is, in the pursuits of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, which he calls <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolically</a> golden fringes. For since this garment is variegated and woven of various <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, patience, and other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, which, covering, as they do, the unseemliness of the flesh, adorn man with a golden ornament.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The Virgins Immediately After the Queen and Spouse.</h2>

<p>Moreover, we must further consider what the Spirit delivers to us in the rest of the psalm, after the enthronization of the manhood assumed by the Word at the right hand of the Father. <q>The <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>,</q> He says,  <q>that be her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto you. With <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> shall they be brought, and shall enter into the King's palace.</q> Now, here the Spirit seems quite plainly to praise <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, next, as we have explained, to the Bride of the Lord, who promises that the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> shall approach second to the Almighty with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, guarded and escorted by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For so lovely and desirable is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, that, next to the Queen, whom the Lord exalts, and presents in sinless <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> and order of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> bear her company, assigned to a place second to that of the Bride. Let these efforts of mine to speak to you, O Arete, concerning <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, be engraven on a monument.</p>

<p>And Procilla having thus spoken, Thekla said, It is my turn after her to continue the contest; and I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, since I too have the favouring wisdom of words, perceiving that I am, like a harp, inwardly attuned, and prepared to speak with elegance and propriety.</p>

<p>Arete . I most willingly hail your readiness, O Thekla, in which I confide to give me fitting discourse, in accordance with your powers; since you will yield to none in universal <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and instruction, instructed by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in what is fitting to say of evangelical and divine doctrine.</p>
