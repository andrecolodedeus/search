<h1>Banquet of the Ten Virgins (Discourse 9)</h1>

<p><strong>Tusiane</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1. Chastity the Chief Ornament of the True Tabernacle; Seven Days Appointed to the Jews for Celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles: What They Signify; The Sum of This Septenary Uncertain; Not Clear to Any One When the Consummation of the World Will Be; Even Now the Fabric of the World Completed.</h2>

<p>O Arete, you dearest boast to the lovers of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, I also implore you to afford me your aid, lest I should be wanting in words, the subject having been so largely and variously handled. Wherefore I ask to be excused exordium and introductions, lest, while I delay in embellishments suitable to them, I depart from the subject: so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, and renowned a thing is <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He appointed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> the legal rite of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> feast of the tabernacles, directed, in Leviticus, how they should keep and do <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the feast; above all things, saying that each one should adorn his tabernacle with <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. I will add the words themselves of Scripture, from which, without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, it will be shown how agreeable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and acceptable to Him, is this ordinance of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>: <q>In the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days: on the first day shall be a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and on the eighth day shall be a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. And you shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows  of the brook; and you shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> before the Lord your God seven days. And you shall keep it a feast unto the Lord seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month. You shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> born shall dwell in booths; that your generations may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I made the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: I am the Lord your God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062683"><a href="../bible/lev023.htm#verse39">Leviticus&nbsp;23:39-42</a></span> </p>

<p>Here the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, fluttering about the bare letter of Scripture, like drones about the leaves of herbs, but not about flowers and fruits as the bee, fully <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that these words and ordinances were spoken concerning such a tabernacle as they erect; as if God delighted in those trivial adornments which they, preparing, fabricate from trees, not perceiving the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come; whereas these things, being like air and phantom shadows, foretell the resurrection and the putting up of our tabernacle that had fallen upon the earth, which at length, in the seventh thousand of years, resuming again <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, we shall celebrate the great feast of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> tabernacles in the new and indissoluble creation, the fruits of the earth having been gathered in, and men no longer begetting and begotten, but God resting from the works of creation. </p>

<p>For since in six days God made the heaven and the earth, and finished the whole world, and rested on the seventh day from all His works which He had made, and blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, <span class="stiki" id="note062685"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;2:1</a></span> so by a figure in the seventh month, when the fruits of the earth have been gathered in, we are commanded to keep the feast to the Lord, which signifies that, when this world shall be terminated at the seventh thousand years, when God shall have completed the world, He shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in us.  For now to this time all things are created by His all-sufficient will and inconceivable power; the earth still yielding its fruits, and the waters being gathered together in their receptacles; and the light still severed from darkness, and the allotted number of men not yet being complete; and the sun arising to rule the day, and the moon the night; and four-footed creatures, and beasts, and creeping things arising from the earth, and winged creatures, and creatures that swim, from the water. Then, when the appointed times shall have been accomplished, and God shall have ceased to form this creation, in the seventh month, the great resurrection-day, it is commanded that the Feast of our Tabernacles shall be celebrated to the Lord, of which the things said in Leviticus are <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> and figures, which things, carefully investigating, we should consider the naked <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, for He says, <q>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: to understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words Of the wise, and their dark sayings.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062687"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse5">Proverbs&nbsp;1:5-6</a></span> </p>

<p>Wherefore let it shame the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that they do not perceive the deep things of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, thinking that nothing else than outward things are contained in the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; for they, intent upon things earthly, have in greater esteem the riches of the world than the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which is of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For since the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are in this way divided that some of them give the likeness of past events, some of them a type of the future, the miserable men, going back, deal with the figures of the future as if they were already things of the past. As in the instance of the immolation of the Lamb, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of which they regard as solely in remembrance of the deliverance of their fathers from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, when, although the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were smitten, they themselves were preserved by marking the door-posts of their houses with blood. Nor do they understand that by it also the death of Christ is personified, by whose blood <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> made safe and sealed shall be preserved from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> in the burning of the world; while the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, the sons of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, shall be destroyed with an utter destruction by the avenging <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who shall reverence the seal of the Blood impressed upon the former.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Figure, Image, Truth: Law Grace, Glory; Man Created Immortal: Death Brought in by Destructive Sin.</h2>

<p>And let these things be said for the sake of example, showing that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have wonderfully fallen from the hope of future good, because they consider things present to be only signs of things already accomplished; while they do not perceive that the figures represent images, and images are the representatives of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For the law is indeed the figure and the shadow of an image, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; but the image, namely, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, is the representative of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself. For the men of olden time and the law foretold to us the characteristics of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> represents those of the new dispensation which is to come. Whence we, having received Christ, saying, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062688"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;14:16</a></span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that shadows and figures have ceased; and we hasten on to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, proclaiming its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> images. For now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <q>in part,</q> and as it were <q>through a glass,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062689"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> since that which is perfect has not yet come to us; namely, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> and the resurrection, when <q>that which is in part shall be done away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062690"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:10</a></span> For then will all our tabernacles be firmly set up, when again the body shall rise, with bones again joined and compacted with flesh. Then shall we celebrate <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to the Lord a glad festal-day, when we shall receive <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> tabernacles, no snore to perish or be dissolved into the dust of the tomb. Now, our tabernacle was at first fixed in an immoveable state, but was moved by transgression and bent to the earth, God putting an end to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by means of death, lest man <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, living a sinner, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> living in him, should be liable to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> curse. Wherefore he died, although he had not been created liable to death or corruption, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was separated from the flesh, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might perish by death, not being able to live longer in one dead. Whence <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being dead and destroyed, again I shall rise <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; and I praise God who by means of death frees His sons from death, and I celebrate lawfully to His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> a festal-day, adorning my tabernacle, that is my flesh, with good works, as there did the five <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> with the five-lighted lamps.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. How Each One Ought to Prepare Himself for the Future Resurrection.</h2>

<p>In the first day of the resurrection I am examined whether I bring these things which are commanded, whether I am adorned with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> works, whether I am overshadowed by the boughs of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. For account the resurrection to be the erection of the tabernacle. Account that the things which are taken for the putting together of the tabernacle are the works of righteousness.I take, therefore, on the first day the things which are set down, that is, on the day in which I stand to be judged, whether I have adorned my tabernacle with the things commanded; if those things are found on that day which here in time we are commanded to prepare, and there to offer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But come, let us consider what follows.</p>

<p><q>And you shall take yon,</q> He says, <q>on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows (and the tree of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>) of the brook; and you shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> before the Lord your God.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, uncircumcised in heart, think that the most beautiful fruit of wood is the citron wood, on account of its size; nor are they ashamed to say that God is worshipped with cedar, to whom not all the quadrupeds of the earth would suffice as a burnt-offering or as <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> for burning. And moreover, O hard breasts, if the citron appear beautiful to you, why not the pomegranate, and other fruits of trees, and among them apples, which much surpass the citron? Indeed, in the Song of Songs, <span class="stiki" id="note062692"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse13">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:13</a></span> Solomon having made mention of all these fruits, passes over in silence the citron only. But this deceives the unwary, for they have not understood that the tree of life <span class="stiki" id="note062693"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse9">Genesis&nbsp;2:9</a></span> which Paradise once bore, now again the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has produced for all, even the ripe and comely fruit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>Such fruit it is necessary that we bring when we come to the judgment-seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, on the first day of the feast; for if we are without it we shall not be able to feast with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor to have part, according to John, <span class="stiki" id="note062694"><a href="../bible/rev020.htm#verse6">Revelation&nbsp;20:6</a></span> in the first resurrection. For the tree of life is wisdom first begotten of all. <q>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her,</q> says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note062695"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse18">Proverbs&nbsp;3:18</a></span> <q>and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is every one that retains her.</q> <q>A tree planted by the waterside, that will bring forth his fruit in due season; </q>  that is, learning and charity and discretion are imparted in due time to those who come to the waters of redemption.</p>

<p>He that has not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor has understood that He is the first principle and the tree of life, since he cannot show to God his tabernacle adorned with the most goodly of fruits, how shall he celebrate the feast? How shall he <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>? Do you desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the goodly fruit of the tree? Consider the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, how pleasant they are beyond the children of men. Good fruit came by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, that is the Law, but not so goodly as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For the Law is a kind of figure and shadow of things to come, but the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of life. Pleasant was the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but not so pleasant as the fruit of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> which is plucked from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Mind Clearer When Cleansed from Sin; The Ornaments of the Mind and the Order of Virtue; Charity Deep and Full; Chastity the Last Ornament of All; The Very Use of Matrimony to Be Restrained.</h2>

<p><q>And you shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062697"><a href="../bible/lev023.htm#verse40">Leviticus&nbsp;23:40</a></span> This signifies the exercise of divine discipline, by which the mind that subdues the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is cleansed and adorned by the sweeping out and ejection from it of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For it is necessary to come cleansed and adorned to the feast, arrayed, as by a decorator, in the discipline and exercise of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the mind being cleansed by laborious exercises from the distracting thoughts which darken it, quickly perceives the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; as the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> <span class="stiki" id="note062698"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;15:8</a></span> found the piece of money after she had swept the house and cast out the dirt, that is, the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which obscure and cloud the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which increase in us from our luxuriousness and carelessness.</p>

<p>Whoso, therefore, desires to come to that Feast of Tabernacles, to be numbered with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, let him first procure the goodly fruit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, then palm branches, that is, attentive meditation upon and study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, afterwards the far-spreading and thickly-leaved branches of charity, which He commands us to take after the palm branches; most fitly calling charity dense boughs, because it is all thick and close and very fruitful, not having anything hare or empty, but all full, both branches and trunks. Such is charity, having no part void or unfruitful. For <q>though I sell all my goods and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and though I yield up my body to the fire, and though I have so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that I can remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</q>  Charity, therefore, is a tree the thickest and most fruitful of all, full and abounding copiously abounding in graces.</p>

<p>After this, what else does He will that we should take? Willow branches; by that figure indicating righteousness, because <q>the just,</q> according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, shall spring up <q>as grass in the midst of the waters, as willows by the watercourses,</q>  flourishing in the word. Lastly, to crown all, it is commanded that the bough of the Agnos tree be brought to decorate the Tabernacle, because it is by its very name the tree of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, by which those already named are adorned. Let the wanton now be gone. who, through their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of pleasure, reject <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. How shall they enter into the feast with Christ who have not adorned their tabernacle with boughs of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, that God-making and blessed tree with which all who are hastening to that assembly and nuptial banquet ought to be begirt, and to cover their loins? For come, fair <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, consider the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> itself, and its commands, how the Divine word has assumed <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> to be the crown of those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and duties that have been mentioned, showing how becoming and desirable it is for the resurrection, and that without it no one will obtain the promises which we who profess <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> supremely cultivate and offer to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. They also possess it who live chastely with their wives, and do, as it were about the trunk, yield its lowly branches bearing <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, not being able like us to reach its lofty and mighty boughs, or even to touch them; yet they, too, offer no less <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, although in a less degree, the branches of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.  But those who are goaded on by their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, although they do not commit fornication, yet who, even in the things which are permitted with a lawful wife, through the heat of unsubdued concupiscence are excessive in embraces, how shall they celebrate the feast? How shall they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, who have not adorned their tabernacle, that is their flesh, with the boughs of the Agnos, nor have listened to that which has been said; that <q>they that have wives be as though they had none? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note062702"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:29</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The Mystery of the Tabernacles.</h2>

<p>Wherefore, above all other things, I say to those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> contests, and who are strong-minded, that without delay they should <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, as a thing the most useful and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>. For in the new and indissoluble creation, whoever shall not be found decorated with the boughs of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, shall neither obtain rest, because he has not fulfilled the command of God according to the law, nor shall he enter into the land of promise, because he has not previously celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles. For they only who have celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles come to the Holy Land, setting out from those dwellings which are called tabernacles, until they come to enter into the temple and city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, advancing to a greater and more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, as the Jewish types indicate. For like as the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, having left the borders of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, first came to the Tabernacles,  and from hence, having again set forth, came into the land of promise, so also do we. For I also, taking my journey, and going forth from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> of this life, came first to the resurrection, which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Feast of the Tabernacles, and there having set up my tabernacle, adorned with the fruits of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, on the first day of the resurrection, which is the day of judgment, celebrate with Christ the millennium of rest, which is called the seventh day, even the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. Then again from thence I, a follower of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <q>who has entered into the heavens,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062704"><a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;4:14</a></span> as they also, after the rest of the Feast of Tabernacles, came into the laud of promise, come into the heavens, not continuing to remain in tabernacles&mdash; that is, my body not remaining as it was before, but, after the space of a thousand years, changed from a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and corruptible form into angelic size and beauty, where at last we <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, when the festival of the resurrection is consummated, shall pass from the wonderful place of the tabernacle to greater and better things, ascending into the very house of God above the heavens, as, says the Psalmist, <q>in the voice of praise and thanksgiving, among such as keep <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day.</q>  I, O Arete, my mistress, offer as a gift to you this robe, adorned according to my ability.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Euboulios</span> . I am much moved, O Gregorion, considering within myself in how great anxiety of mind Domnina must be from the character of the discourses, perplexed in heart as she is, and with good <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, fearing lest she should be at a loss for words, and should speak more feebly than the rest of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, since they have spoken on the subject with such ability and variety. If, therefore, she was evidently moved, come and complete this too; for I wonder if she had anything to say, being the last speaker.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gregorion</span> . Theopatra told me, Euboulios, that she was greatly moved, but she was not perplexed from want of words. After, therefore, Tusiane had ceased, Arete looked at her and said, Come, my daughter, deliver also a discourse, that our banquet may be quite complete. At this Domnina, blushing, and after a long delay, scarcely looking up, rose to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and turning round, invoked Wisdom to be her present helper. And when she had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, Theopatra said that suddenly <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> came to her, and a certain divine confidence possessed her, and she said:&mdash; </p>
