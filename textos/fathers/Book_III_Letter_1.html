<h1>Book III, Letter 1</h1>

<p> <em>To Peter, Subdeacon.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Peter, Subdeacon of Campania.</p>

<p>What a crime has been committed in the Lucullan fort against our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>  the account which has been sent to us has made manifest. And, inasmuch as the magnificent Scholasticus, judge of Campania, happens at the present time to be with us here, we have especially enjoined on him the duty of visiting the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of so great perversity with strict correction. But, since the bearer of the aforesaid account has requested us to send some one to represent ourselves, we therefore send the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> Epiphanius, who, together with the aforesaid judge, may be able to investigate and ascertain by whom the sedition was raised or investigated, and to visit it with suitable punishment. Let your Experience then make haste to give aid in this case with all your power, to the end both that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be ascertained, and that vengeance may proceed against the guilty parties. Wherefore, since the slaves of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Clementina are said to have had to do with this same crime, and to have used language calculated to stir up the sedition, do thou subject them strictly to immediate punishment, nor let your severity be relaxed in consideration of her person, since they ought to be smitten all the more as they have transgressed out of mere <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> as being the servants of a noble lady. But you ought also to make thorough enquiry whether the said lady was privy to so atrocious a crime, and whether it was perpetrated with her <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that from our visitation of it all may learn how dangerous it is not only to lay hands on a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but even to transgress in words against one. For, if anything should be done remissly or omitted in this case, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou especially wilt have to bear the blame and the risk; nor will you find any plea for excuse with us. For in proportion as this business will commend you to us if it be most strictly investigated and corrected, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that our indignation will become sharp against you, if it be smoothed over.</p>

<p>Moreover, for the rest, if any slaves from the city should have taken refuge in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint Severinus, or in any other church of this same fort, as soon as this has come to your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by no means allow them to remain there, but let them be brought to the church within the city; and, if they should have just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of complaint against their masters, they must needs leave the church with suitable arrangements made for them. But, if they should have committed any venial fault, let them be restored without delay to their masters, the latter having taken <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to pardon them.</p>
