<h1>Book III, Letter 22</h1>

<p> <em>To Antoninus, Subdeacon.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Antoninus, Subdeacon, Rector of the patrimony in Dalmatia.</p>

<p>It is commonly reported in these parts that our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Natalis of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Salona, is dead. If this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, let your Experience with all speed and all care hasten to admonish the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of that city that with one consent they elect a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ordination; and, when the nomination of the person who may be elected has been made, you will take care to transmit it to us, that he may be ordained with our consent, as has been the case from ancient times. And this above all things you must look to, that in this election neither any <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribery</a> in any way whatever come in, nor the patronage of any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whatever prevail. For if one is elected through the patronage of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, he is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> out of deference to them to comply with their wishes after his ordination, and so it comes to pass that the possessions of that church are lessened, and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order is not maintained. They must, therefore, under your superintendence, elect such a person as will not be unsuitably subservient to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of any one, but one who in the adornment of his life and conversation may be found worthy of such a high degree. But of the possessions or ornaments of the same church <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> an inventory to be faithfully written out in your presence. And, lest any of the possessions themselves should be lost, admonish Respectus the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and Stephanus the chief notary (<em>primicerium notariarum</em>) to take sole charge of these possessions, warning them that they will have to make good out of their own substance any diminution of them that may have arisen from their negligence.</p>

<p>Moreover, strictly charge Malchus , our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that he refrain entirely from intermeddling in this matter. For, should we learn that anything has been done or attempted by him against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he will incur no slight guilt and danger. But of this also take care to warn him, that he must be careful to set down and complete the accounts of our patrimony which he has had in charge; for doing which let him make haste, laying aside all excuses, to come to us from the Sicilian parts. Let him, then, in no wise presume to meddle with the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Salona, lest he should be under further liability to it, and possibly found culpable. For he is said to have many things belonging to the aforesaid church; and report goes that he was nearly the prime mover in the sale of its possessions, and in other unlawful doings. And, should this be found in manifest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be as it is said to be, he may be certain that it will by no means remain unavenged.</p>

<p>Let any necessary expenses be defrayed by the steward who was in office at the time of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> death, that so he may explain his accounts to the future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them to be. All the things that we have enjoined on you to be done it is certainly necessary that you should do with the advice of our son, the magnificent and most eloquent Marcellus , to the end that you may be able to carry out carefully and effectively all that is contained in this paper of directions, and that no blame for negligence may belong to you</p>
