<h1>Book III, Letter 3</h1>

<p> <em>To John, Abbot</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to John, etc.</p>

<p>Your Love has requested me that brother Boniface might be ordained Prior (<em>pr&aelig;positus</em>)  in your <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; as to which request I wonder much why it has not been done before. For since the time when I caused him to be given to you you ought already to have ordained him.</p>

<p>With regard to the tunic of Saint John , I have been altogether gratified by your anxiety to tell me of it. But let your Love endeavour to send me this tunic, or (better still) this same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who has it, with his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and with the tunic itself, to the end that we may enjoy the blessing thereof, and be able to derive benefit from this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. I have been desirous of putting an end to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that is pending with Florianus, and have already advanced to him as much as eighty <em>solidi</em>, which I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> he proposes should be given him in compensation for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>'s debt; and I am altogether desirous that this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> should be settled, inasmuch as Stephen the <em>chartularius</em> is said to be urgent that the aforesaid Florianus should transfer it to public cognizance, and it is distasteful to us to be engaged in a public lawsuit. Wherefore we must needs make some concession, so as to be able to bring this same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to a composition. When this shall have been done, we will inform your Love of it.</p>

<p>But do thou give your whole attention to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the brethren. Let it be now enough that the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> has been stained through your negligence. Do not often go abroad. Appoint an agent for these causes, and do thou leave yourself time for reading and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<p>Be attentive to hospitality; as far as you are able, give to the poor; yet so as to keep what ought to be restored to Florianus. Moreover, among the brethren of your <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> whom I see I do not find addiction to reading. Wherefore you must needs consider how great a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> it is, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should have sent you alimony from the offerings of others, and you should neglect learning the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Further, with regard to the six twelfths, unless we see the original deed, or a copy of it, we can do nothing. But I have sent an order to the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Florentinus, that, if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should be made apparent to him, he restore to you the six twelfths; after the restoration of which we will either grant the remaining six twelfths on lease or commute the revenue.</p>
