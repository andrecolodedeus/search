<h1>Book III, Letter 32</h1>

<p> <em>To Honoratus, Archdeacon.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Honoratus, Archdeacon of Salona. </p>

<p>The mandates of ourselves and of our predecessor had reached your Love not long ago, in which thou were acquitted of the charges <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniously</a> brought against you; and we ordered you to be reinstated without any dispute in the order of your rank. But, inasmuch as again after no great lapse of time, you came to the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> complaining of some improper proceedings among you concerning the alienation of sacred vessels, and as, while we had <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with us here who might have replied to your objections, Natalis, your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, departed this life, we have judged it necessary to confirm further by this present letter those same mandates, both our predecessor's and our own, which (as has been said) we sent not long ago for your acquittal. Wherefore, acquitting you fully of all the charges brought against you, we will that thou continue without any dispute in the rank of your order, so that the question raised by the aforesaid man may not on any pretext prejudice you in the least degree. Moreover, as to the heads of your complaint, we have strictly charged Antoninus, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> and rector in your parts of the patrimony of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church over which, by God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, we preside, that, if he should find <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> implicated in them, he decide these cases with the utmost strictness and authority. But, in case of the business being with such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as the vigour of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> jurisdiction cannot reach, he is to deposit the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> under each particular head among the public acts, and transmit them to us without any delay, that, being accurately informed, we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how, with the help of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to dispose of the matter.</p>
