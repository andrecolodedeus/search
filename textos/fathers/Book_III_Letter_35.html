<h1>Book III, Letter 35</h1>

<p> <em>To Peter, Subdeacon.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Peter, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> of Campania. </p>

<p>Our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has often requested us to allow him to return to his own church. And, having perceived this to be reasonable, we have thought it needful to accede to his petition. Consequently let your Experience convene the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the Neapolitan church, to the end that they may choose two or three of their number, and not omit to send them hither for the election of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But let them also intimate, in their communication to us, that those whom they send represent them all in this election, so that their church may have its own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> validly ordained. For we cannot allow it to be any longer without a ruler of its own. Should they perchance try in any way to set aside your admonition, bring to bear on them the vigour of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline. For he will be giving <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his own perverseness, whosoever does not of his own accord assent to this proceeding. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be given to the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, one hundred <em>solidi</em>, and one little orphan boy, to be selected by himself, for his labour in behalf of the same church. Further, admonish those who are to come hither as representing all for the election of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to remember that they must bring with them all the episcopal vestments, and also as much money as they may foresee to be necessary for him who may be elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to have to his own use. But lose no time in dispatching those of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who are selected as we have said, that, seeing that there are present here various nobles of the city of Naples, we may treat with them concerning the election of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and take counsel together with the help of the Lord.</p>
