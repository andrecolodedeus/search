<h1>Book III, Letter 47</h1>

<p> <em>To the Clergy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Salona</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Having read your letter, beloved, we learn that you have made choice of Honoratus your archdeacon; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is altogether pleasing to us that you have chosen for the order of episcopacy a man tried of old and of grave manner of life. We too join with you in approbation of his personal character, inasmuch as it is already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us; and it has been our own wish also that he should be ordained as your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> according to your desire. For which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we exhort you to persist in his election without any ambiguity. Nor ought any circumstances to disincline you from his person, since, as this laudable choice is now approved, so it will impose both a burden on your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and a stain of unfaithfulness on your <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, if any one should seduce you (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) to turn aside your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> from him. But as to those who are not at one with you in this desired election, we have caused them to be admonished by Antoninus our <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, that they may be able to agree with you. To him also we have already given our injunctions as to what ought to be done with respect to the person of our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Malchus.  But, inasmuch as we have ourselves also written to him, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he will without delay keep himself quiet from disquieting you. If by any chance he should in any way whatever neglect to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, his contumacy will in every way be mulcted with the utmost rigour of canonical punishment.</p>
