<h1>Book III, Letter 48</h1>

<p> <em>To Columbus, Bishop</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Columbus, etc.</p>

<p>Even before receiving your Fraternity's letter, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you from the report of your deserved <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> to be a good servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And now that I have received it, I understand more fully that what fame had already spread abroad was well founded; and I greatly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in your deserts, in that you exhibit manners and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that testify to a praiseworthy life. Since, then, I feel that these things are conferred on you by the Supernal Majesty, I congratulate you; and I bless God our Creditor, who denies not the gifts of His mercy to His <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> servants. On this account I declare it to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that your Fraternity so kindles me with the flame of charity to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, and my spirit is so united to you, that I both desire to see you and am also with you in heart, though absent. You perceive in your own thoughts that this is so. For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> unity of minds in charity has power to unite more than bodily presence can. Furthermore, that with your whole <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, your whole heart, your whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, you cleave and art devoted to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> I am now assured, as, indeed before your letter had borne testimony to the fact, I plainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. Wherefore, first addressing you with the greeting of charity which is due, I exhort you not to cease to be mindful of what you have promised to the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>

<p>Wherefore be thou urgent with the primate of your synod , that boys be in no wise admitted to sacred orders, lest they fall by so much the more dangerously as they hasten more speedily to mount to higher places. Let there be no venality in ordination: let not the influence or entreaty of any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> obtain anything in contravention of these our prohibitions. For without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> God is offended if any one is promoted to sacred orders, not for merit, but by favour (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) or venality.</p>

<p>If, then, you are aware of these things being done, keep not silence, but oppose them urgently; since, if perchance you should neglect them, or conceal them when <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of, the chain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will bind not those alone who do such things, but no light guilt before God will touch you also in the matter. If, then, anything of the kind is committed, it ought to be restrained by canonical punishment, lest so great a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in others, acquire strength from connivance.</p>

<p>I have, therefore, the sooner given leave of departure to the bearer of these presents, Victorinus, your Fraternity's <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, whom I think to be your imitator, and whom I have received with charity; and by him I have transmitted to you for a blessing keys of the blessed Peter, in which something from his chains is included.</p>

<p>Lastly, with regard to the unity and peace of the council which, under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you are taking measures to assemble, let your Charity <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> my mind by informing me of everything particularly.</p>
