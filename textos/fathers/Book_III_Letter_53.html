<h1>Book III, Letter 53</h1>

<p> <em>To John, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to John, Bishop of Constantinople. </p>

<p>Though consideration of the case moves me, yet charity also impels me to write, since I have written once and again to my most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother the lord John, but have received no letter from him. For some one else, a secular person, addressed me under his name; seeing that, if those were really his letters, I have not been vigilant, having <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> of him something far different from what I have found. For I had written about the case of the most reverend <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> John, and about the questions of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Isauria, one of whom, being in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> orders, has been beaten with clubs in your church; and your most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fraternity (as appears from the signature of the letter) has written back to me professing <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of what I wrote about. At this reply I was exceedingly astonished, revolving within myself in silence, if he speaks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, what can be worse than that such things should be done against the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and even he who was close at hand should not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? For what excuse can a shepherd have if the wolf devours the sheep and the shepherd <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it not? But, if your Holiness <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> both what I referred to in my letter and what had been done, whether against John the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or against Athanasius, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Isauria and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and wrote to me, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; what can I reply to this, since the Truth says through His Scripture, <em>The mouth that lies slays the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse11">Wisdom 1:11</a></span>? I demand of you, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother; has that so great abstinence of yours come to this, that by denial you would hide from your brother what you knew to have been done? Had it not been better that flesh should go into that mouth for food, than that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> should come out of it for deceiving a neighbour; especially when the Truth says, <em>Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse11">Matthew 15:11</a></span>? But far be it from me to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything of the kind of your most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> heart. Those letters were headed with your name, but I do not think they were yours. I had written to the most blessed lord John; but I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that that familiar of yours has replied&mdash;that youngster, who as yet has learned nothing about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the bowels of charity; who in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> doings is accused by all; who daily lays snares against the deaths of various people by means of concealed wills; who neither fears God nor regards men. Believe me, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother, you must first correct this man, that from the example of those who are near to you those who are not near may be better amended. Do not give ear to his tongue: he ought to be directed after the counsel of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; not your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> swayed by his words. For, if you listen to him, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you cannot have peace with your brethren. For I, as my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bears me <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, wish to quarrel with no man; and with all my power I avoid it. And, though I desire exceedingly to be at peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, it is especially so with you, whom I exceedingly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, if only you are yourself the person whom I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. For, if you do not observe the canons, and wish to tear to pieces the statutes of the Fathers, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not who you are. So act, then, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most dear brother, that we may mutually recognize each other, lest, if the ancient foe should move us two to take offense, he slay many through his most atrocious victory. As for me, to show that I seek to do nothing in a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> spirit, if that youngster of whom I have before spoken did not hold the topmost place of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doing with your Fraternity, I could meanwhile have passed over in silence what is ready to my hand from the canons, and have sent back to you with confidence the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who came to me at the first, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that your Holiness would receive them with charity. But even now I say; Either receive these same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, restoring them to their orders, and leaving them in quiet; or, if perchance you are unwilling to do this, observe in their case the statutes of the Fathers and the definitions of the canons, putting aside all altercation with me. But, if you should do neither, we indeed are unwilling to bring on a quarrel, but still do not shun one if it comes from your side. Moreover your Fraternity <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> well what the canons say about <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who desire to inspire <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> by blows. For we have been made shepherds, not persecutors. And the excellent preacher says, <em>Argue, beseech, rebuke, with all longsuffering and doctrine</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse2">2 Timothy 4:2</a></span>. But new and unheard of is this preaching, which exacts <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by blows. But I need not speak at length by letter about these things, since I have sent my most beloved son, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Sabinianus, as my representative in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, to the threshold of our lords; and he will speak with you about everything more particularly. Unless you are disposed to wrangle with us, you will find him prepared for all that is just. Him I commend to your Blessedness, that he at least may find that lord John whom I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> in the royal city.</p>
