<h1>Book III, Letter 57</h1>

<p> <em>From John, Bishop of Ravenna to Pope Gregory</em>. </p>

<p>My most reverend fellow-servant Castorius, notary of your Apostolical See, has delivered to me my Lord's epistle, compounded of honey and of venom; which has yet so infixed its stings as still to leave place for healing appliances. For my Lord, while he reproves <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and speaks of divine judgment following it, in a certain way professes himself with reason to be mild and placid.</p>

<p>You have alleged, then, that I, ambitious of novelty, have usurped the use of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> beyond what had been indulged to my predecessors. This let not the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of my own lord, which is governed by the divine right hand, in any way allow itself to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; nor let him open his most sacred ears to the uncertainty of common report. First, because I, though a sinner, still <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how grave a thing it is to transgress the limits assigned to us by the Fathers, and that all elation leads to nothing but a fall. For, if our ancestors did not tolerate <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in kings, how much more is it not to be endured in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>! Then, I remember how I was nourished in the lap and in the bosom of your most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Roman Church, and therein by the aid of God advanced. And how should I be so daring as to presume to oppose that most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> see, which transmits its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to the universal Church, for maintaining whose authority, as God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, I have seriously excited the ill-will of many enemies against myself? But let not my most blessed lord suppose that I have attempted anything contrary to ancient custom, as is attested by many and nearly all the citizens of this city, and as the above-written most reverend notary, even though he had taken no part in the proceedings, might have testified, inasmuch as it was not till the sons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were descending from the sacristy , and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were coming in for proceeding immediately [to the altar] that the first <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> has been accustomed to invest the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ravenna with the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, which he has also been accustomed in like manner to use in solemn litanies.</p>

<p>Wherefore let no one endeavour to insinuate anything against me to my lord, since if any one wishes to do so, he cannot prove that any novelty has been introduced by me. For in what manner I have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> your commands and served your interests when <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> required, may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> make manifest to your most sincere heart: and I attribute it to my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that after so many labours and difficulties which I endure within and without I should deserve to experience such a change. But again this among other things consoles me, that most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers sometimes chastise their sons for the purpose only of advancing them the more, and that, after this devotion and satisfaction, you will not only conserve to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church of Ravenna her ancient privileges, but even confer greater ones in your own times.</p>

<p>For with respect to the napkins, the use of which by my <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> your Apostleship alleges to be a presumption, I confess in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that it irks me to say anything on the subject, since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by itself, which alone prevails with my lord, is sufficient. For this being allowed to the smaller churches constituted around the city, the apostleship of my lord will also be able in all ways to find, if he deigns to enquire of the venerable <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of his own first Apostolical See, that as often as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or levites of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ravenna have come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the ordination of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or for business, they all have <em>proceeded</em>  with napkins before the eyes of your most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> predecessors without any blame. Wherefore also at the time when I, sinner as I am, was ordained there by your predecessor, all my <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> used them while <em>proceeding</em>  in attendance on the lord pope. And since our God in His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> has placed all things in your hand and most pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you by the very Apostolical See, which you formerly adorned by your character, and now govern with due dignity, that you in no respect diminish on account of my deservings the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ravenna, which is intimately yours; but, even according to the voice of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, let it be laid upon me and upon my father's house, according to its deserving. I have, therefore, for your greater satisfaction, subjoined all the privileges which have been indulged by your predecessors to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church of Ravenna, though none the less finding assurance in your venerable archives in reference to the times of the consecration of my predecessors. But now whatever, after ascertaining the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you may command to be done, is in God's power and yours; since I, desiring to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the commands of my lord's Apostleship, have taken care, notwithstanding ancient custom, to abstain till I receive further orders.</p>
