<h1>Book III, Letter 6</h1>

<p> <em>To John, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Prima Justiniana. </p>

<p> After the long afflictions which Adrian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Theb&aelig;, has endured from his fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, as though they had been his enemies, he has fled for refuge to the Roman city. And though his first representation had been against John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09004b.htm">Larissa</a>, to wit that in pecuniary causes he had given judgment without regard to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, yet after this he complained most grievously rather against the person of your Fraternity, accusing you of having deposed him <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> from the degree of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. But we, giving no credence to petitions that have not been enquired into, perused the acts of the proceedings, whether before our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John, or before your Fraternity. And indeed concerning the judgment of the above-named John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09004b.htm">Larissa</a>, which was suspended on appeal, both the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperors, in their orders sent to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Corinth, have sufficiently decreed, and we have decreed also, Christ helping us, in our letters directed through the bearers of these presents to the aforesaid John of Larissa. But having ventilated the conflicting judgments, the examination of which the imperial commands had committed to you, and inspected the series of proceedings held before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John concerning the incriminated <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, we find that you have investigated almost nothing pertaining to the questions named and assigned to you for decision, but by certain machinations hast produced witnesses against the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Demetrius, who were to allege with a view to the condemnation of this same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that they had heard this Demetrius bearing testimony concerning the said <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>&mdash;a thing not even lawful to be heard of. And when Demetrius in person denied having done so, it appears that, contrary to the custom of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and canonical discipline, you gave him into the hands of the pr&aelig;tor of the province as a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> deposed from his dignity.  And when, mangled by many stripes, he might perchance have said some things <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> against his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> under the pressure of torment, we find that to the very end of the business he confessed absolutely nothing of the things about which he was interrogated. Neither do we find anything else in the proceedings themselves, whether in the depositions of witnesses or in the declaration of Adrian, to his disadvantage. But it is only that your Fraternity, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not with what motive, in contempt of law, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and divine, has pronounced an abrupt sentence against him; which, even though it had not been suspended on appeal, being pronounced in contravention of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and canons, could not rightly in itself have stood. Further, after, as is abundantly evident, the appeal had been handed to you, we wonder why you have not sent your people to us to render an account of your judgment according to the undertaking delivered to our <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Honoratus by the representatives of your church. This omission convicts you either of contumacy or of trepidation of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. If, then, these things which have been brought before us have the rampart of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, inasmuch as we consider that, taking advantage of your vicariate jurisdiction under us, you are presuming <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, we will, with the help of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, decree further concerning these things, according to the result of our deliberations.</p>

<p>But as regards the present, by the authority of the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, we decree that, the decrees of your judgment being first annulled and made of none effect, thou be deprived of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> communion for the space of thirty days, so as to implore pardon of our God for so great transgression with the utmost penitence and tears. But, if we should come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you have been remiss in carrying out this our sentence, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> thou that not the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> only, but also the contumacy, of your Fraternity will have to be more severely punished. But, as to our aforesaid brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Adrian, condemned by your sentence, which, as we have said, was consistent with neither canons nor <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, we order that he be restored, Christ being with him, to his place and rank; so that neither may he be injured by the sentence of your Fraternity pronounced in deviation from the path of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, nor may your Charity remain uncorrected; that so we may appease the indignation of the future judge.</p>
