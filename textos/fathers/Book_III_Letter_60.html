<h1>Book III, Letter 60</h1>

<p> <em>To Italica, Patrician</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Italica, etc.</p>

<p>We have received your letter, which is full of sweetness, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to hear that your Excellency is well. Such is the sincerity of our own mind with regard to it that paternal affection does not allow us to suspect any latent ill-feeling concealed under its calmness. But may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> bring it to pass, that, as we think what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of you, so your mind may respond with good towards us, and that you may exhibit in your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> the sweetness which you express in words. For the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> health and beauty on the surface of the body profit nothing if there is a hidden sore within. And that discord is the more to be guarded against to which exterior peace affords a bodyguard. But as to what your Excellency in your aforesaid epistle takes pains to recall to our recollection, remember that you have been told in writing that we would not settle anything with you concerning the causes of the poor so as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> offense, or with public clamour. We remember writing to you to this effect, and also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, God helping us how to restrain ourselves with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> moderation from the wrangling of suits at law, and, according to that <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> sentence, to endure joyfully the spoiling of our goods. But this we suppose you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; that our silence and patience will not be to the prejudice of future pontiffs after me in the affairs of the poor. Wherefore we, in fulfilment of our aforesaid promise, have already determined to keep silence on these questions; nor do we desire to mix ourselves personally in these transactions, wherein we feel that too little kindness is being shown. But, lest you should hence <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> daughter, that we still altogether renounce what pertains to concord, we have given directions to our son, Cyprianus the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who is going to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, that, if you arrange about these matters in a salutary way, and without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he should settle them with you by our authority, and that we should be no further vexed by the business which may thus be brought to a conclusion amicably. Now may Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to turn to possibility things altogether impossible, may He inspire you both to arrange your affairs with a view to peace, and, for the good of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to consult the benefit of the poor of this Church in matters which concern them.</p>
