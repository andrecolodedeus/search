<h1>Book III, Letter 65</h1>

<p> <em>To Mauricius Augustus</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Mauricius, etc.</p>

<p>He is guilty before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> who is not pure of offense towards our most serene lords in all he does and says. I, however, unworthy servant of your Piety, speak in this my representation neither as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, nor as your servant in right of the republic, but as of private right, since, most serene Lord, you have been mine since the time when you were not yet lord of all.</p>

<p>On the arrival here of the most illustrious Longinus, the equerry (<em>stratore</em>), I received the law of my lords, to which, being at the time worn out by bodily sickness, I was unable to make any reply. In it the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of my lords has ordained that it shall not be lawful for any one who is engaged in any public administration to enter on an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office. And this I greatly commended, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> by most evident <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that one who is in haste to desert a secular condition and enter on an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office is not wishing to relinquish secular affairs, but to change them. But, at its being said in the same law that it should not be lawful for him to become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, I was altogether surprised, seeing that his accounts can be rendered through a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and it can be arranged for his debts also to be recovered from the place into which he is received. For with whatever devout intention a person may have wished to become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, he should first restore what he has wrongly gotten, and take thought for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> all the more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> as he is the more disencumbered. It is added in the same law that no one who has been marked on the hand  may become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. This ordinance, I confess to my lords, has alarmed me greatly, since by it the way to heaven is closed against many, and what has been lawful until now is made unlawful. For there are many who are able to live a religious life even in a secular condition: but there are very many who cannot in any wise be saved with God unless they give up all things. But what am I, in speaking thus to my lords, but dust and a worm? Yet still, feeling that this ordinance makes against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the Author of all, I cannot keep silence to my lords. For power over all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> has been given from heaven to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of my lords to this end, that they who aspire to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may be helped, and that the way to heaven may be more widely open, so that an earthly kingdom may wait upon the heavenly kingdom. And lo, it is said in plain words that one who has once been marked to serve as an earthly soldier may not, unless he has either completed his service or been rejected for weakness of body, serve as the soldier of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>To this, behold, Christ through me the last of His servants and of yours will answer, saying; From a notary I made you a Count of the bodyguard; from Count of the bodyguard I made you a C&aelig;sar; from a C&aelig;sar I made you Emperor; and not only so, but also a father of emperors. I have committed my <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> into your hand; and do you withdraw your soldiers from my service? Answer your servant, most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord, I beseech you; what will you answer to your Lord when He comes and thus speaks?</p>

<p>But perhaps it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that no one among them turns <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> with a pure motive. I, your unworthy servant, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how many soldiers who have become <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in my own days have done <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, have wrought signs and mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. But by this law it is forbidden that even one of such as these should become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>.</p>

<p>Let my Lord enquire, I beg, what former emperor ever enacted such a law, and consider more thoroughly whether it ought to have been enacted. And indeed it is a very serious consideration, that now at this time any are forbidden to leave the world; a time when the end of the world is drawing near. For lo! There will be no delay: the heavens on fire, the earth on fire, the elements blazing, with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and archangels, thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, the tremendous Judge will appear. Should He remit all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and say only that this law has been promulged against Himself, what excuse, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, will there be? Wherefore by the same tremendous Judge I beseech you, that all those tears, all those <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, all those <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, all those <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of my Lord, may not on any ground lose their lustre before the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>: but let your Piety, either by interpretation or alteration, modify the force of this law, since the army of my lords against their enemies increases the more when the army of God has been increased for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<p>I indeed, being subject to your command, have caused this law to be transmitted through various parts of the world; and, inasmuch as the law itself is by no means agreeable to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lo, I have by this my representation declared this to my most serene lords. On both sides, then, I have discharged my duty, having both yielded <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the Emperor, and not kept silence as to what I feel in behalf of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
