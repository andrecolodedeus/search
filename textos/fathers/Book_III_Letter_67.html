<h1>Book III, Letter 67</h1>

<p> <em>To <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, Metropolitan. </em></p>

<p>Gregory to <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, etc.</p>

<p>On receiving the letters of your most sweet Blessedness I greatly rejoiced, since they spoke much to me of sacred Scripture. And, finding in them the dainties that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, I greedily devoured them. Therein also were many things intermingled about external and necessary affairs. And you have acted as though preparing a banquet for the mind so that the offered dainties might please the more from their diversity. And if indeed external affairs, like inferior and ordinary kinds of food, are less savoury, yet they have been treated by you so skilfully as to be taken gladly, since even contemptible kinds of food are usually made sweet by the sauce of one who cooks well. Now, while the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the History is kept to, what I had said some time ago about its divine meaning ought not to be rejected. For, although, since you will have it so, its meaning may not suit my case, yet, from its very context, what was said as being drawn from it may be held without hesitation. For her violator (<em>i.e. Dinah's</em>) is called the prince of the country <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen034.htm#verse2">Genesis 34:2</a></span>, by whom the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is plainly denoted, seeing that our Redeemer says, <em>Now shall the prince of this world be cast out</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse31">John 12:31</a></span>. And he also seeks her for his wife, because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit hastens to possess lawfully the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which he has first corrupted by hidden seduction. Wherefore the sons of Jacob, being very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, take their swords against the whole house of Sichem and his country <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen034.htm#verse25">Genesis 34:25</a></span>, because by all who have <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> those also are to be attacked who become abettors of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit. And they first enjoin on them <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and afterwards, while they are sore, slay them. For severe teachers, if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to moderate their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, though cutting off the bias of corruption by preaching, nevertheless, when delinquents already mourn for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> they had done, are frequently still savage in roughness of discipline, and harder than they should be. For those who had already cut off their foreskins ought not to have died, since such as lament the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of lechery, and turn the pleasure of the flesh into sorrow, ought not to experience from their teachers roughness of discipline, lest the Redeemer of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> be Himself loved less, if in His behalf the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is afflicted more than it should be. Hence also to these his sons Jacob says, <em>You have troubled me, and made me odious to the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaanites</a></em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ibid. 5:30). For, when teachers still cruelly attack what the delinquents already mourn for, the weak mind's very <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for its Redeemer grows cold, because it feels itself to be afflicted in that wherein of itself it does not spare itself.</p>

<p>So much therefore I would say in order to show that the sense which I set forth is not improbable in connection with the context. But what has been inferred from the same passage by your Holiness for my comfort I gladly accept, since in the understanding of sacred Scripture whatever is not opposed to a sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ought not to be rejected. For, even as from the same gold some make necklaces, some rings, and some bracelets, for ornament, so from the same <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sacred Scripture different expositors, through innumerable ways of understanding it, compose as it were various ornaments, which nevertheless all serve for the adornment of the heavenly bride. Further, I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> exceedingly that your most sweet Blessedness, even though occupied with secular affairs, still brings back its genius vigilantly to the understanding of Holy Writ. For so indeed it is needful that, if the former cannot be altogether avoided, the latter should not be altogether put aside. But I beseech you by Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, stretch out the hand of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to me who am labouring in so great billows of tribulation, that by your intercession I may be lifted up to the heights, who am pressed down to the depths by the weight of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Moreover, though I grieve that the Emperor of the Persians has not been converted, yet I altogether <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> for that you have preached to him the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; since, though he has not been counted worthy to come to the light, yet your Holiness will have the reward of your preaching. For the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a>, too, goes black into the bath, and comes out black; but still the keeper of the bath receives his pay.</p>

<p>Further, of Mauricius you say well, that from the shadow I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>; that is, that in small things I may perpend greater things. In this matter, however, we trust him, since oaths and hostages bind his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to us.</p>
