<h1>Book II, Letter 19</h1>

<p> <em>To all the Bishops of Dalmatia.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> constituted throughout Dalmatia.</p>

<p>Though desiring to visit your Fraternity frequently through the intercourse of letters, yet, when some special case demands our attention, we wish to take the opportunity of fulfilling two duties at once, so as both to refresh our brotherly <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the way of visitation and to explain accurately matters that come up for notice, lest <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of them should leave the mind confused. Now when our brother Natalis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Salona, wished to advance the archdeacon Honoratus to the order of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, who thereupon declined being advanced to a higher order, the latter demanded my predecessor of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, in a petition that he sent, that he should not be so advanced against his will. For he alleged that the thing was attempted, not for the sake of promoting him, but in consequence of displeasure against him. Thereupon our predecessor of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory addressed letters to Natalis, our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, interdicting him from promoting the archdeacon Honoratus against his will, or retaining in his heart the soreness of the displeasure which he had conceived against him. And when we too had laid the same interdiction on the said Natalis, he, not only disregarding the commands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also setting at naught our letters, attempted, it is said, craftily to degrade the aforesaid archdeacon, in a way contrary to custom, under colour of promoting him to a higher dignity. Thus it was contrived that, having removed him from the archdeaconry, he might call in another person to minister in the place of the deposed archdeacon. Now we think that this Honoratus may have fallen under the displeasure of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on account of having prevented him from giving <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> to his relations: and both my predecessor of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory formerly and I now have wished to investigate the case accurately; but he, conscious of what he had done, has put off sending a representative with a view to its trial, lest the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with respect to his doings might appear. We therefore, now that he has been already so often admonished by letter, and has so far been pertinaciously obstinate, have taken order for his being admonished once more in letters sent to him through the bearer of these presents, to the end that he may, immediately on the arrival of the bearer of these presents, receive the archdeacon Honoratus into his former place. And if, with heart still hardened, he should contumaciously defer restoring him to the said position, we order that for his contumacy so many times exhibited he be deprived of the use of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> granted to him by this See. But if, even after loss of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, he should persevere in the same pertinacity, we order him to be debarred from participation in the body and blood of the Lord. For it is right that he should find those severe in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> whom he set at naught when they approached him in charity. Wherefore neither do we now deviate from the path of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has despised; but, when he whose guilt has by no means been made apparent to us has been restored to his place, we enjoin the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Natalis to send to us a person with instructions, who may be able by his allegations to prove to us the right intentions of the said <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. For we have caused also the said archdeacon to come to us, that, having heard the assertions of both parties, we may decide whatever may be just, whatever may be well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>. For we defend no one on the ground of personal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but, God helping us, keep the rule of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> without respect to any man's person.</p>
