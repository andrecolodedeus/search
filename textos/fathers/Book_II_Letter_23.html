<h1>Book II, Letter 23</h1>

<p> <em>To John, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to John, Bishop of Prima Justiniana in <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>.</p>

<p>It is clearly a manifest evidence of goodness that the consent of all should concur in the election of one person. Since, then, the account which we have received from our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> declared that you are summoned to the position of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> by the unanimous consent of the whole council and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the most serene Prince, we have rendered thanks with great exultation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> our Creator, who has made your life and actions so commendable in the past as to bring about (what is exceedingly to your credit) your approving yourself to the judgment of all. With them we also fully agree with regard to the person of your Fraternity. And we implore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that, as His Grace has chosen your Charity, so He would keep you in all respects under His protection. We have sent you the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> according to custom, and, renewing our commission, we appoint you to act as vicar of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, admonishing you that you so show yourself gentle to your subjects that they may be provoked to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you rather than to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> you. And, if perchance any fault of theirs should require notice, you will be careful so to correct their transgressions as by no means to discard paternal affection from your mind. Be watchful and assiduous in the care of the flock committed to you, and strict in the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of discipline, so that the wolf lying in wait may not prevail to disturb the Lord's sheepfold, or have opportunity for deceit, so as to hurt the sheep. Make haste with full purpose of heart to win <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we have received the name of shepherd not for repose, but for labour. Let us, then, show forth in our work what our name denotes. If we weigh with right consideration the prerogative of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, it will be to those who are diligent and do their duty well for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but to those who are negligent assuredly for a burden. For, as this name, in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, conducts those who labour and are assiduous for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, so in the case of the idle and sluggish it tends to punishment. Through our tongue let the people committed to us learn that there is another life. Let the teaching of your Fraternity be to them an acceptable spur to urge them on, and your life an example for imitation. For your Fraternity's preaching should disclose to them what to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and what to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and your efficiency in this way should reap the fruit of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> retribution. But let your deliberate care especially constrain you never to attempt to make any unlawful ordinations; but, whenever any are promoted to the clerical order, or, it may be, to some higher rank, let them be ordained, not for <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a> or entreaties, but for merit. In no ordination let any consideration, in any way whatever, surreptitiously reach your Fraternity, lest you should be entangled (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) in the snares of simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. <em>For what shall it profit a man</em>, as the Truth says, <em>if he shall gain the whole word, and lose his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar008.htm#verse36">Mark 8:36</a></span>? Hence it is necessary for us to look to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all we do, to despise temporal and perishable things, and to direct the desire of our heart to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Your Holiness's present  I was altogether unwilling to accept, since it were very unseemly for us to seem to have received gifts from our plundered and afflicted brethren. But your messengers got the better of me by another argument, proffering it to one from whom your Fraternity's offerings may not be withheld.  For this you ought before all things to study: how you may provide imperishable gifts to be offered to the coming judge of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, to the end that He may have respect both to you for your profitable labour, and to us likewise for our exhortation.</p>
