<h1>Book II, Letter 37</h1>

<p> <em>To John, Bishop of Squillacium (Squillace, in Calabria).</em></p>

<p>Gregory to John, etc.</p>

<p>The care of our pastoral office warns us to appoint for bereaved churches <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their own, who may govern the Lord's flock with pastoral solicitude. Accordingly we have held it necessary to appoint you, John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <em>civitas Lissitana</em> (<em>Lissus</em>, hodie, <em>Alessio?</em>), which has been captured by the enemy, to be cardinal  in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Squillacium, that you may carry on the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> once undertaken by you, having regard to future retribution. And although, being driven from your own Church by the invading enemy, you must govern another Church which is now without a shepherd, yet it must be on condition that, in case of the former city being set free from the enemy, and under the protection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> restored to its former state, thou return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in which you were first ordained. If, however, the aforesaid city continues to suffer under the calamity of captivity, you must remain in this Church wherein you are by us incardinated.  Moreover, we enjoin you never to make unlawful ordinations, or allow any bigamist, or one who has taken a wife who was not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, or one <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of letters, or one maimed in any part of his body, or a penitent, or one liable to any condition of service, to attain to sacred orders. And, should you find any of this kind, you must not dare to advance them. Africans generally, and unknown strangers, applying for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> orders, on no account accept seeing that some Africans are <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, and some have been rebaptized; while many strangers, though being in minor orders, are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have pretended to a higher dignity. We also admonish your Fraternity to watch wisely over the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> committed to you, and to be more intent on winning <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> than on the profits of the present life. Be diligent in keeping and disposing of the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that the coming Judge, when He comes to judge, may approve you as having in all respects worthily executed the office of shepherd which you have taken upon you.</p>
