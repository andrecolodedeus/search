<h1>Book II, Letter 41</h1>

<p>Gregory to Castorius, Bishop of Ariminum (Rimini).</p>

<p>What lamentable supplications have been poured out to us by Luminosus, abbot of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Andrew and St. Thomas, in the city of Ariminum, appears from the text of the subjoined petition. With regard to this matter we exhort your Fraternity that, on the death of the abbot of this same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, your church shall under no pretext interfere in scheduling or taking charge of the property of the said <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, acquired or to be acquired. And we desire you to ordain as abbot of the same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> none other but him whom the whole congregation may by common consent demand as being worthy in character and apt for monastic discipline. Moreover, we entirely forbid public masses to be celebrated there by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, lest occasion be given for popular assemblies in the retreats of God's servants, and also lest too frequent an entrance of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of scandal (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid), especially to the simpler <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Further, we ordain that this paper by us written shall be carefully held to, and kept in force and unadulterated in all future time by you and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that shall be ordained after you; that so, with the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both your church may be content with its own rights and no more, and also the said <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, being subject henceforth to none but general or canonical jurisdiction, and free from all annoyances and vexations, may accomplish its divine work with the utmost devotion of heart.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">In place of the epistle as above given, the following, with the appended paper on the privileges of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, is found in some Codices.</span> </p>

<p> <em>Gregory to Castorius, Bishop of Ariminum.</em></p>

<p>What lamentable supplications Luminosus, abbot of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saints Andrew and Thomas, in the city of Ariminum, has poured out to us, appears from the text of the subjoined petition. For from his account we learn that in very many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> have suffered many prejudices and annoyances from prelates. It is therefore the duty of your Fraternity to make provision for their future quiet by a wholesome arrangement, to the end that those who have their conversation therein in God's service may, His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> assisting them, persevere with minds free from disturbance. But, lest from a custom which ought to be rather amended than continued, any one should presume to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> any kind of annoyance to <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, it is necessary that the things which we have caused to be enumerated below should be so carefully observed by the fraternity of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that no possible occasion of introducing disquiet may be found hereafter.</p>

<p> <em>Of the privileges of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">Monasteries</a>.</em></p>

<p>We therefore interdict in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and forbid by the authority of the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in whose stead we preside over this Roman Church, that any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or secular person hereafter presume in any way to devise occasions of interfering with regard to the revenues, property, or writings of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, or of the cells or vills thereto appertaining, or have recourse to any tricks or exactions: but, if any case should by chance arise as to land disputed between their churches and any <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and it cannot be arranged amicably, let it be terminated without intentional delay before selected abbots and other fathers who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> upon the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. Also on the death of the abbot of any congregation, let no stranger be ordained, or any but one of the same congregation whom the society of the brethren shall of its own accord have elected unanimously, and who shall have been elected without fraud or venality. But, if they cannot find a suitable person among themselves, let them in like manner elect some one from some other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to be ordained. Nor, when an abbot has been constituted, let any person whatever on any pretext be put over him, unless perchance (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) crimes be apparent which are shown to be punishable by the sacred canons. Likewise the rule is to be observed, that <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> must not, without the consent of the abbot, be removed from <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for constituting other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, or for sacred orders, or for any clerical office. We also disallow <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> schedules of the property of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to be made by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But if, circumstances requiring it, the abbot of a place should have questions with other abbots concerning property that has come into possession, let the matter be terminated also by their counsel or judgment. On the death also of an abbot let not the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on any pretext intermeddle in the scheduling or taking charge of the property of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, acquired, or given, or to be acquired. We also entirely forbid public masses to be celebrated by him in a convent, lest in the retreats of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and their places of refuge any opportunity for a popular concourse be afforded, or an unwonted entrance of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> should ensue, which would be by no means of advantage to their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Nor let him dare to place his episcopal chair there, or have any power whatever of command, or of holding any ordination, even the most ordinary, unless he should be requested to do so by the abbot of the place; that so the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> may always remain under the power of their abbots: and let no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> detain a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in any church without a testimonial and permission from his abbot, or promote one without such permission to any dignity. We ordain, then, that this paper by us written be kept to for all future time, in force and unadulterated, by all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; that both they may be content with the rights of their own churches and no more, and that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> be subject to no <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions, or compelled services, or <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of any kind to secular authorities (saving only canonical jurisdiction ), but, freed from all vexations and annoyances, may accomplish their divine work with the utmost devotion of heart.</p>
