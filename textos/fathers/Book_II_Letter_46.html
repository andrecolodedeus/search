<h1>Book II, Letter 46</h1>

<p> <em>To John, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to John, Bishop of Ravenna. </p>

<p>That I have not replied to the many letters of your Blessedness attribute not to sluggishness on my part, but to weakness, seeing that, on account of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when Ariulph, coming to the Roman city, killed some and mutilated others, I was affected with such great sadness as to fall into a colic sickness. But I wondered much why it was that that well-known care of your Holiness for me was of no advantage to this city and to my needs. When, however, your letters reached me, I became aware that you are indeed taking pains to act, but yet have no one on whom you can bring your action to bear. I therefore attribute it to my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that this man  with whom we are now concerned both evades fighting against our enemies and also forbids our making peace; though indeed at present, even if he wished us to make it, we are utterly unable, since Ariulph, having the army of Authar and Nordulf, desires their subsidies  to be given him ere he will deign to speak to us at all about peace.</p>

<p>But, as to the case of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Istria , I have learned the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of all you had told me in your letters from the commands which have come to me from the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> princes, bidding me abstain for the present from compelling them. I indeed feel with you, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> greatly in your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and ardour, with regard to what you have written, and acknowledge myself to have become in many ways your debtor. Know nevertheless that I shall not cease to write with the greatest <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and freedom on this same matter to the most serene lords. Moreover the animosity of the aforesaid most excellent Romanus Patricius ought not to move you, since, as we are above him in place and rank, we ought so much the more to tolerate with forbearance and dignity any light conduct on his part.</p>

<p>If, however, there is any opportunity of prevailing with him, let your Fraternity work upon him, so that we may make peace with Ariulph, if to some small extent we may, since the soldiery have been removed from the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as he himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. But the Theodosiacs , who have remained here, not having received their pay, are with difficulty induced to guard the walls; and how shall the city subsist, left destitute as it is by all, if it has not peace?</p>

<p> Furthermore, as to the gift redeemed from captivity, about whom you have written to us asking us to enquire into her origin, we would have your Holiness <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that an unknown person cannot easily be traced. But as to what you say about one who has been ordained being ordained again, it is exceedingly ridiculous, and outside the consideration of one disposed as you are, unless perchance some precedent is adduced which ought to be taken into account in judging him who is alleged to have done any such thing. But far be it from your Fraternity to entertain such a view. For, as one who has been once <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> ought not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, so one who has been once <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> again to the same order. But in case of any one's attainment of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> having been accompanied by slight misdemeanour, he ought to be adjudged to penance for the misdemeanour, and yet return his orders.</p>

<p>With regard to the city of Naples , in view of the urgent insistance of the most excellent Exarch, we give you to understand that Arigis , as we have ascertained, has associated himself with Ariulph, and is breaking his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the republic, and plotting much against this same city; to which unless a duke be speedily sent, it may already be reckoned among the lost.</p>

<p>As to what you say to the effect that <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> should be sent to the city of the schismatic Severus which has been burnt , your Fraternity is of this opinion as being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a> that he sends to the Court in opposition to us. And, even though these were not sent, we should have to consider that compassion is to be shown first to the faithful, and afterwards to the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For indeed there is near at hand the city Fanum, in which many have been taken captive, and to which I have already in the past year desired to send <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, but did not venture to do so through the midst of the enemy. It therefore seems to me that you should send the Abbot Claudius there with a certain amount of money, in order to redeem the freemen whom he may find there detained in slavery for ransom, or any who are still in captivity. But, as to the sum of money to be thus sent, be assured that whatever you determine will please me. If, moreover, you are treating with the most excellent Romanus Patricius for allowing us to make peace with Ariulph, I am prepared to send another person to you, with whom questions of ransom may be better arranged.</p>

<p>Concerning our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Natalis  I was at one time greatly distressed, in that I had found him acting haughtily in certain matters; but, since he has himself amended his manners, he has overcome me and consoled my distress. In connection with this matter admonish our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Malchus  that before he comes to us he render his accounts, and then depart elsewhere if it is necessary. And if we find his conduct good, it will perhaps be necessary for us to restore to him the patrimony which he had charge of.</p>
