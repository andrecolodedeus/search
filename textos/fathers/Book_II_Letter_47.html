<h1>Book II, Letter 47</h1>

<p> <em>To Dominicus, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Dominicus, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. </p>

<p>We have received with the utmost gratification the letters of your Fraternity, which have reached us somewhat late by the hands of Donatus and Quodvultdeus, our most reverend brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and also Victor the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> with Agilegius the notary. And though we thought that we had suffered loss from the tardiness of their coming, yet we find gain from their more abundant charity; seeing that from this delay in point of time there appears no interruption, but rather increase of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which, by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through your <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, your practice of reading, and your maturity of age, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be already firmly planted in you. For it would not flow so largely from you, had it not very many most abundant veins in your heart. Let us, therefore, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother, hold fast with unshaken firmness this mother and guard of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Let not the tongues of the deceitful diminish it in us, or any snares of the ancient enemy corrupt it. For this joins what is divided, and keeps together what is joined. This lifts up what is lowly without tumour; this brings down what is lifted up without dejection. Through this the unity of the universal Church, which is the knitting together of the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, rejoices in its several parts through the mind's equalization of them, though having in it dissimilarity from the diversity of its members. Through this these members both exult in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of others, though in themselves afflicted, and also droop for the sorrows of others, though in themselves joyful. For seeing that, as the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> testifies, if one member suffers anything, the other members suffer with it, and if one member glories, all the members <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with it, I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that you groan for our perturbation, as it is quite certain that we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> for your peace.</p>

<p>Now as to your Fraternity rejoicing with us on our ordination, it displays to me the affection of most sincere charity. But I confess that a force of sorrow strikes through my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of this order of ministry. For heavy is the weight of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; seeing that it is necessary for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, first to live so as to be an example to others, and then to be on his guard not to lift up his heart because of the example which he shows. He should ever be thinking of the ministry of preaching, considering with most intense <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> how that the Lord, when about to depart to receive for Himself a kingdom, and giving talents to His servants, says, <em>Trade till I come</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse13">Luke 19:13</a></span>. Which trading surely we carry on only if by our living and our speaking we win the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of our neighbours; if by preaching the joys of the heavenly kingdom we strengthen all that are weak in divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; if by terribly sounding forth the punishments of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> we bend the froward and the timid; if we spare no one against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; if, given to heavenly friendships, we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> enmities. And indeed it was in thus showing himself that the Psalmist <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he had offered a kind of Sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he said, <em>Did I not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> you, and was I not grieved with your enemies! Yea I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> them with a perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, and they became enemies unto me</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse21">Psalm 138:21</a></span>.  But in view of this burden I tremble for my infirmity, and look to the returning of the Master of the house, after receiving His kingdom, to take account of us. But with what heart shall I bear His coming, if from the trading I undertook I render Him no gain, or almost none? Do thou, therefore, most dear brother, help me with your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; and what you see me to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for myself, consider daily on your own account with anxious dread. For through the bond of charity both what I say of myself is your concern, and what I desire you to do is mine.</p>

<p>Further, as to what your Fraternity writes about <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> privileges, keep to this without any hesitation, since, as we defend our own rights, so we observe those of several churches. Nor do I through partiality grant to any Church whatever more than it deserves, nor do I under the instigation of ambition derogate from any what belongs to it by right; but I desire to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> my brethren in all ways, and study accordingly that each may be advanced in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, so long as there can be no opposition to it of right on the part of one against the other. Further, I greatly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with you in the manners of your messengers, in whom it has been shown me how much you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me, in that you have sent to me elect brethren and sons.</p>

<p>Given the tenth of the Kalends of August, tenth indiction.</p>
