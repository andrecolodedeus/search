<h1>Book II, Letter 48</h1>

<p> <em>To Columbus, Bishop</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Columbus, etc.</p>

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, most dear brother in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that the ancient enemy, who by cunning persuasion deposed the first man from the delights of Paradise to this life of care, and in him even then inflicted the penalty of mortality on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, does now with the same cunning, so as more easily to seize the flock, endeavour to infect the shepherds of the Lord's sheep with infused poisons, and already to claim them as his own by right. But we, who, though unworthy, have undertaken the government of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> in the stead of Peter the prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, are compelled by the very office of our pontificate to resist the general enemy by all the efforts in our power. Now the bearers of these presents, Constantius and Mustellus, have in a petition presented to us given us to understand, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Pudentiana constituted in the province of Numidia assert, that Maximianus, prelate of the same Church, corrupted by a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, has by a new licence allowed a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be made in the place where he lives; which thing, though previous usage allowed it, is prohibited from remaining and continuing by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.  On this account, then, we have deemed it necessary to exhort your Fraternity by these present writings that, when Hilarus our <em>chartularius</em> comes to you, this same case be subjected to a thorough and wise investigation in an united general council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, having the terror of the coming judge before their eyes. And if this charge should be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> with sufficient evidences by the bearers of these presents against the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, let him by all means be degraded from the dignity and office which he enjoys, that both he may return to the gains of penitence through acknowledgment of his fault, and others may not presume to attempt such things.</p>

<p>For it is right that one who has sold <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> to a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> for money received, as is said to have been done, should be removed from handling the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of His most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body and blood. Further, if, apart from this accusation, there is any contest afoot among them, as is contained in the petition of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> themselves, with respect to certain wrongs or private transactions, this let your Fraternity with our aforesaid <em>chartularius</em> fully enquire into with evidence adduced, and decide it according to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> between all the parties.</p>

<p>But, further, we have learned through the information given us by the bearers of these presents that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> is for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> spreading daily, and that very many, leave being given them through venality, are being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> a second time by the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. How serious a matter this is, brother, it behooves us with the whole bent of our minds to consider. Lo, the wolf tears the Lord's flock, no longer stealthily in the night, but in the open light; and we see him advance in the slaughter of the sheep, and with no solicitude, with no darts of words, do we oppose him. What fruits, then, of a multiplied flock shall we show to the Lord, if even that of which we have undertaken the feeding we see with easy mind mangled by the wild beast? Let us therefore study to inflame our hearts by imitation of earthly shepherds, who often keep watch through winter nights, pinched with showers and frost, lest even one sheep, and perchance not a profitable one, should perish. And, if the prowler should have bitten it with greedy mouth, how do they busy themselves, with what palpitations of heart do they pant, with what cries do they leap forward to rescue the captured sheep, stimulated by the pressing need, lest anything lost through their carelessness should be required of them by the Lord of the flock! Let us then watch, lest anything should perish: and, if anything should by chance have been seized, let us bring it back to the Lord's flock by the cries of divine discourses, that He who is the Shepherd of shepherds may mercifully vouchsafe to approve us in His judgment as having kept watch over His sheepfold. This also it is needful for you to attend to wisely; that, if there should be any proper petition on the part of the same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> against the bearers of these presents, it should be thoroughly enquired into; and, if haply they themselves also should rightly deserve to be smitten for their own fault, we pronounce that they should by no means be spared on the ground of their having had the toil of resorting to us.</p>

<p>In the month of August, tenth indiction.</p>
