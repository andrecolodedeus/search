<h1>Book II, Letter 51</h1>

<p> <em>To All Bishops.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>. </p>

<p>I have received your letters with the utmost gratification: but I shall have far abundant <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, if it should be my lot to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in your return from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Now the forefront of your Epistle notifies that you suffer severe <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. But <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, if endured irrationally, is of no profit at all unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For it is impious in any one to expect a recompense of reward for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For you ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, as the blessed Cyprian says, that it is not the suffering that makes the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for which he suffers. This being so, it is exceedingly incongruous for you to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> whereof you speak, seeing that you are not thereby at all advanced towards <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rewards. Let, then, purity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> bring your Charity back to your mother church who bare you; let no bent of your mind dissociate you from the unity of concord; let no persuasion deter you from seeking again the right way. For in the synod which dealt with the three chapters it is distinctly evident that nothing pertaining to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was subverted, or in the least degree changed; but, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, the proceedings had reference only to certain individuals; one of whom, whose writings evidently deviated from the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, was not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> condemned. </p>

<p>Moreover, as to what you write about <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> among other provinces having been especially scourged since that time, you ought not to twist this into a reproach, since it is written, <em>Whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews 12:6</a></span>. If, then, it is as you say, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> has been since that time the more loved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in all ways approved, having been counted worthy of enduring the scourge of the Lord. But, since it is not as you try to make out by way of insulting over her, attend to reason.</p>

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> of illustrious memory, having been appointed in the royal city , promulgated a sentence of condemnation against Theodora, then empress, or against the <a href="../cathen/01100c.htm">Acephali</a> , the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was then attacked and captured by enemies. Does it follow from this that the <a href="../cathen/01100c.htm">Acephali</a> had a good case, or that they were <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> condemned, because such things happened after their condemnation? Away with the thought! For it is not fit that either any one of you, or any others who have been instituted in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, should say or in any way acknowledge this. This then being recognized, retire even now at length from the determination you have come to. Wherefore, that full satisfaction may be infused into your minds, and all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> removed, with respect to the three chapters, I have judged it of advantage to send you the book which my predecessor of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, Pope Pelagius, had written on this subject.  Which book if you should be willing to read again and again, putting aside the spirit of wilful self-defence, I have confidence that you will follow it in all respects, and, notwithstanding all, return to union with us. But if henceforth, after perusal of this book, you should decide to persist in your present determination, you will doubtless show that you gave yourselves up not to reason but to obstinacy. Wherefore once more, in a spirit of compassion, I admonish your Charity, that, inasmuch as under God the purity of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has remained inviolate in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, you put away from you all swelling of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and return to your mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who expects and invites her sons; and this all the more speedily as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that she expects you daily.</p>
