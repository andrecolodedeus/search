<h1>Book II, Letter 6</h1>

<p> <em>To the Neapolitans.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, nobles, gentry, and commonalty  dwelling at Naples.</p>

<p>Although the sincere devotion of spiritual sons in behalf of their mother Church needs no exhortation, nevertheless, it ought to be stirred up by letter, lest it should suppose itself slighted. On this account I approach your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with an admonition of paternal charity, that with many tears and with one accord we may render thanks to our Redeemer, who has not suffered you to walk along pathless ways under so perverse a teacher, but has made publicly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the crimes of your unworthy pastor. For Demetrius, to wit, who even before had not deserved to be called a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, has been found to be involved in transactions to such an extent and of such a kind that, if he had received judgment without mercy according to the character of his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, he would undoubtedly have been condemned to a most hard death by both divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. But since, being reserved for penance, he has been deprived of the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, we cannot suffer the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> to remain long without a teacher, since it is laid down by canonical rules that, on the death or removal of a pastor, the church should not be long deprived of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.  Wherefore, I have thought it necessary to admonish your Charity by this present writing that neither delay nor the discord which has been wont to generate scandals ensue to hinder your election of a pontiff. But seek you out with all care such a person as all by common consent may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in, and as is in no respect rejected by the sacred canons; to the end that the office which the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> of men had polluted by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> administration may be worthily filled and administered by him, whoever he may be, who, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and with His approval, shall be ordained.</p>
