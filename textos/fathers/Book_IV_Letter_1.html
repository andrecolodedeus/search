<h1>Book IV, Letter 1</h1>

<p> <em>To Constantius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Constantius, Bishop of Mediolanum (<em>Milan</em>).</p>

<p>On receiving the letters of your Fraternity I returned great thanks to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I was counted worthy to be refreshed by the celebration of your ordination. Truly that all, by the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with one accord concurred in your election, is a fact which your Fraternity ought with the utmost consideration to estimate, since, after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you are greatly indebted to those who with so submissive a disposition desired you to be preferred before themselves.</p>

<p>It becomes you, therefore, with <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> benignity to respond to their behaviour, and with kind sympathy to attend to their needs. If perchance there are any faults in any of them, rebuke these with well-considered reproofs, so that your very <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> indignation be mingled with a savour of sweetness, and that so you may be loved by your subjects even when you are greatly feared. Such conduct will also induce great reverence for your person in their judgment; since, as hasty and habitual rage is despised, so discriminate indignation against faults for the most part becomes the formidable in proportion as it has been slow.</p>

<p>Further, John our <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, who has returned, has reported many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of you as to which we beseech <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> Himself to fulfil what He has begun; to the end that He may show you to have advanced in good inwardly and outwardly both now among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and hereafter among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, we have sent you, according to custom, a <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> to be used in the sacred solemnities of mass. But I beg you, when you receive it, to vindicate its dignity and its meaning by humility.</p>
