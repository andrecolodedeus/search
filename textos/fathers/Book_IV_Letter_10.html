<h1>Book IV, Letter 10</h1>

<p> <em>To All the Bishops of Dalmatia.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> through Dalmatia. </p>

<p>It behooved your Fraternity, having the eyes of the flesh closed out of regard to Divine judgment, to have omitted nothing that appertains to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to a right inclination of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, nor to have preferred the countenance of any man whatever to the uprightness of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But now that your manners have been so perverted by secular concerns, that, forgetting the whole path of the sacerdotal dignity that is yours, and all sense of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, you study to accomplish what may please yourselves and not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we have held it necessary to send you these specially strict written orders, whereby, with the authority of the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, we enjoin that you presume not to lay hands on any one whatever in the city of Salona, so far as regards ordination to episcopacy, without our consent and permission; nor to ordain any one in the same city otherwise than as we have said.</p>

<p>But if, either of your own accord, or under compulsion from any one whatever, you should presume or attempt to do anything contrary to this injunction, we shall decree you to be deprived of participation of the Lord's body and blood, that so your very handling of the business, or your very inclination to transgress our order, may cut you off from the sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and no one may be accounted a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whom you may ordain. For we wish no one to be rashly ordained whose life can be found fault with. And so, if the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Honoratus is shown to be unworthy, we desire that a report may be sent us of the life and manners of him who may be elected, that whatever is to be done in this matter we may allow to be carried out salubriously with our consent.</p>

<p>For we trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that, as far as in us lies, we may never suffer to be done what may damage our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; never what may damage your <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Church</a>. But, if the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> consent of all should so fix on one person that by the favour of God he may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> worthy, and there should be no one to dissent from his being ordained, we wish him to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by you in this same church of Salona under the license granted in this present epistle; excepting notwithstanding the person of Maximus, about whom many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> reports have reached us: and, unless he desists from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> the higher order, it remains, as I think, that after full enquiry, he should be deprived also of the very office which he now holds.</p>
