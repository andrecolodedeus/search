<h1>Book IV, Letter 2</h1>

<p> <em>To Constantius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Constantius, Bishop of Mediolanum.</p>

<p>My most beloved son, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Boniface, has conveyed to me certain private information through your Fraternity's letter; namely that three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, having sought out rather than found an occasion, have separated themselves from the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> communion of your Fraternity, saying that you have assented to the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> , and have given a security.  And, indeed, whether there has been any mention made of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> in any word or writing whatever your Fraternity remembers well; although your Fraternity's predecessor, Laurentius, did send forth a most strict security to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, to which most noble men in legitimate number subscribed; among whom I also, at that time holding the pr&aelig;torship of the city, likewise subscribed; since after such a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> had taken place about nothing, it was right that the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> should take heed, with the view of guarding in all respects the unity of the Universal Church in the minds of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. But as to its being said that our daughter, Queen Theodelinda, after hearing this news, has withdrawn herself from your communion, it is for all reasons evident that, though she has been seduced to some little extent by the words of bad men, yet, on the arrival of Hippolytus the notary, and John the abbot, she will seek in all ways the communion of your Fraternity.  To her also I have addressed a letter , which I beg your Fraternity to transmit to her without delay. Further, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who appear to have separated themselves, I have written another letter, which when you have caused to be shown to them, I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that they will repent of the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> before your Fraternity.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you have accurately and briefly informed me of what has been done, whether by King Ago  or by the Kings of the Franks. I beg your Fraternity to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me in all ways what you have so far ascertained. But, if you should see that Ago, King of the Lombards, is doing nothing with the Patrician , promise him on our part that I am prepared to give attention to his case, if he should be willing to arrange anything with the republic advantageously.</p>
