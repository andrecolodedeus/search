<h1>Book IV, Letter 20</h1>

<p> <em>To Maximus, Pretender (Pr&aelig;sumptorem)</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Maximus, Pretender in Salona.</p>

<p>Though the merits of any one's life were in other respects such as to offer no impediment to his ordination to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> offices, yet the crime of canvassing in itself is condemned by the severest strictness of the canons. Now we have been informed that thou, having either obtained surreptitiously, or pretended, an order from the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> princes, hast forced your way to the order of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> , which is of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be venerated, while being in your life unworthy. And this without any hesitation we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, inasmuch as your life and age are not unknown to us, and further, because we are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the mind of our most serene lord the Emperor, in that he is not accustomed to mix himself up in the causes of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, lest he should in any way be burdened by our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. An unheard-of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is also spoken of; that, even after our interdiction, which was pronounced under pain of excommunication of you and those who should ordain you, it is said that you were brought forward by a military force, and that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were beaten. Which proceeding we can in no wise call a consecration, since it was celebrated by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> men. Since, therefore, without any precedent, you have violated such and so great a dignity, namely that of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, we enjoin that, until I shall have ascertained from the letters of our lords or of our <em>responsalis</em>, that you were ordained under a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and not a surreptitious order, you and your ordainers by no means presume to handle anything connected with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, and that you approach not the service of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar till you have heard from us again. But, if you should presume to act in contravention of this order, be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> from God and from the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that your punishment may afford an example to other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches also, through their <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the judgment upon you. The month of May, Indiction 12.</p>
