<h1>Book IV, Letter 21</h1>

<p> <em>To Venantius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Venantius, Bishop of Luna (<em>in Etruria</em>).</p>

<p>It has reached us by the report of many that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> slaves are detained in servitude by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> living in the city of Luna ; which thing has seemed to us by so much the more offensive as the sufferance of it by your Fraternity annoys us. For it was your duty, in respect of your place, and in your regard for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, to leave no occasion for simple <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to serve Jewish <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> not through persuasion, but, in a manner, by right of authority. Wherefore we exhort your Fraternity that, according to the course laid down by the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, no Jew be allowed to retain a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> slave in his possession. But, if any are found in their power, let liberty be secured to them by protection under the sanction of law. But as to any that are on the property of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, though they be themselves free from legal obligation, yet, since they have long been attached to the cultivation of their lands as bound by the condition of their tenure, let them continue to cultivate the farms they have been accustomed to do, rendering their payments to the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and performing all things that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> require of husbandmen or natives, except that no farther burden be imposed on them. But, whether any one of these should wish to remain in his servitude, or any to migrate to another place, let the latter consider with himself that he will have lost his rights as a husbandman by his own rashness, though he has got rid of his servitude by force of law. In all these things, then, we desire you to exert yourself so wisely that neither may thou be a guilty pastor of a dismembered flock, nor may your too little <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> render you reprehensible before us.</p>
