<h1>Book IV, Letter 25</h1>

<p> <em>To the Nobles and Proprietors in Sardinia.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to the Nobles, etc.</p>

<p>I have learned from the report of my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Felix, and my son the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Cyriacus , that nearly all of you have peasants (<em>rusticos</em> ) on your estates given to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. And this has made me very sorry, since I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the guilt of subjects weighs down the life of their superiors, and that, when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in a subject is not corrected, sentence is flung back on those who are over them. Wherefore, magnificent sons, I exhort that with all care and all solicitude you be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and see what account you will render to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> for your subjects. For indeed they have been committed to you for this end, that both they may serve for your advantage in earthly things, and you, through your care for them, may provide for their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the things that are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. If, then, they pay what they owe you, why pay you not them what you owe them? That is to say, your Greatness should assiduously admonish them, and restrain them from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, to the end that by their being drawn to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> you may make <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> propitious to yourselves. For, lo, you observe how the end of this world is close at hand; you see that now a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, now a divine, sword rages against us: and yet you, the worshippers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, behold stones adored by those who are committed to you, and are silent.  What, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, will you say in the tremendous judgment, when you have received God's enemies into your power, and yet disdain to subdue them to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and recall them to Him? Wherefore, addressing you with due greeting, I beg that your Greatness would be earnestly on the watch to give yourselves to <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hasten to inform me in your letters which of you has brought how many to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If, then, haply from any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you are unable to do this, enjoin it on our aforesaid brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Felix, or my son Cyriacus, and afford them succour for the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that so in the retribution to come you may be in a state to partake of life by so much the more as you now afford succour to a good work.</p>
