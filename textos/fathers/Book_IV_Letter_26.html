<h1>Book IV, Letter 26</h1>

<p> <em>To Januarius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Januarius, Bishop of Caralis (<em>Cagliari</em>).</p>

<p>We have ascertained from the report of our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Felix and the abbot Cyriacus that in the island of Sardinia <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are oppressed by lay judges, and that your ministers despise your Fraternity; and that, so far as appears, while you aim only at simplicity, discipline is neglected. Wherefore I exhort you that, putting aside all excuses, thou take pains to rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of which you have received the charge, to keep up discipline among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> no one's words. But, as I hear, you have forbidden your Archdeacon to live with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and up to this time art set at naught with regard to this your prohibition. Unless he <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> your command, our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is that he be deprived of his sacred order.</p>

<p>There is another thing also which is much to be deplored; namely, that the negligence of your Fraternity has allowed the peasants (<em>rusticos</em>) belonging to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church to remain up to the present time in infidelity. And what is the use of my admonishing you to bring such as do not belong to you to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if you neglect to recover your own from infidelity? Hence you must needs be in all ways vigilant for their conversion. For, should I succeed in finding a pagan peasant belonging to any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whatever in the island of Sardinia, I will visit it severely on that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<p>But now, if any peasant should be found so perfidious and obstinate as to refuse to come to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, he must be weighted with so great a burden of payment as to be compelled by the very pain of the exaction to hasten to the right way. </p>

<p>It has also come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that some in sacred orders who have lapsed, either after doing penance or before, are recalled to the office of their ministry; which is a thing that we have altogether forbidden and the most sacred canons also declare against it. Whoso, then, after having received any sacred order, shall have lapsed into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the flesh, let him so forfeit his sacred order as not to approach any more the ministry of the altar. But, lest those who have been ordained should ever perish, previous care should be taken as to what kind of people are ordained, so that it be first seen to whether they have been continent in life for many years, and whether they have had a care for reading and a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of almsgiving. It should be enquired also whether a man has perchance been twice married. It should also be seen to that he be not illiterate, or under liability to the state, so as to be compelled after assuming a sacred order to return to public employment. All these things therefore let your Fraternity diligently enquire into, that, every one having been ordained after diligent examination, none may be easily liable to be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> after ordination. These things which we have written to your Fraternity do you make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> under you, since I myself have been unwilling to write to them, lest I might seem to lessen your dignity.</p>

<p>It has also come to our ears that some have been offended by our having forbidden <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> to touch with chrism those who are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. And we indeed acted according to the ancient use of our Church: but, if any are in fact hereby distressed, we allow that, where there is a lack of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> may touch with chrism, even on their foreheads, those who are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. </p>
