<h1>Book IV, Letter 27</h1>

<p> <em>To Januarius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Januarius, Bishop of Caralis (<em>Cagliari</em>).</p>

<p>Your Fraternity ought indeed to have been so attentive to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> duties as to be in no need at all of our admonitions to induce you to fulfil them: yet, as certain particulars that require correction have come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, there is nothing incongruous in your having besides a letter addressed to you bearing our authority.</p>

<p>Wherefore we apprize you that we have been given to understand that it has been the custom for the Guest-houses (<em>Xenodochia</em>) constituted in the parts about Caralis to submit their accounts in detail from time to time to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city; that is, so as to be governed under his guardianship and care. Now, as your Charity is said to have so far neglected this, we exhort, as has been said, that the inmates who are or have been established in these Guest-houses submit their accounts in detail from time to time. And let such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be ordained to preside over them as may be found most worthy in life, manners and industry, and at any rate <em>religiosi</em> , whom judges may have no power of annoying, lest, if they should be such as could be summoned to the courts, occasion might be given for wasting the feeble resources which they have: concerning which resources we wish you to take the greatest care, so that they be given away to no one without your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, lest the carelessness of your Fraternity should go so far as to let them be plundered.</p>

<p>Moreover, you know that the bearer of these presents, Epiphanius the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, was criminally accused in the letters of certain Sardinians. We, then, having investigated his case as it was our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to do, and finding no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of what was charged against him, have absolved him, so that he might be restored to his place. We therefore desire you to search out the authors of the charge against him: and, unless he who sent those same letters be prepared to support his charges by canonical and most strict <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, let him on no account approach the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> communion.</p>

<p>Further, as to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, who is said to have been often detected in malpractices, and who had fled into Africa, having returned to a lay state of life in despite of his cloth, if it is so, we have seen to his being given up to penance after previous corporal punishment, to the end that, according to the apostolic sentence, by means of affliction of the flesh the spirit may be saved, and also that he may be able to wash away with continual tears the earthly filth of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which he is said to have contracted by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> works.</p>

<p>Moreover, in accordance with the injunctions of the canons, let no religious person (<em>religiosus</em>) associate with those who have been suspended from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> communion.</p>

<p>Further, for ordinations or marriages of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, or from <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who are veiled, let no one presume to receive any fee, unless they should prefer to offer something of their own accord.</p>

<p>As to what should be done in the case of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who have left <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for a lay life, and have taken husbands, we have conversed at length with your Fraternity's aforesaid <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, from whose report your Holiness may be more fully informed.</p>

<p>Further, let religious <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> (<em>religiosi clerici</em>)  avoid resort to or the patronage of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>; but let them be in all respects subject to your jurisdiction according to the canons, lest through the remissness of your Fraternity the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> over which you preside should be dissolved.</p>

<p>Lastly, as to the men who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> with the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who had left their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and are said to be now suspended from communion, if your Fraternity should observe them to have repented worthily for such a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, we will that thou restore them to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> communion.</p>
