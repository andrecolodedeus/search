<h1>Book IV, Letter 3</h1>

<p> <em>To Constantius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Constantius, Bishop of Mediolanum.</p>

<p>It has come to my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of your diocese, seeking out rather than finding an occasion, have attempted to sever themselves from the unity of your Fraternity, saying that you had given a security  at the Roman city for your condemnation of the three Chapters. And the fact is that they say this because they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how I am accustomed to trust your Fraternity even without security. For if there had been need for anything of the kind, your mere word of mouth could have been trusted. I, however, do not recollect any mention between us of the three Chapters either in word or in writing. But as for them, if they soon return from their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, they should be spared, because, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, <em>They understand neither what they say nor whereof they affirm</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse7">1 Timothy 1:7</a></span>. For we, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> guiding us and our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, declare that we keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod of Chalcedon in all respects inviolate, and venture not to add anything to, or to subtract anything from, its definition.  But, if any one would fain take upon himself to think anything, either more or less, contrary to it, and to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of this same synod, we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> him without any hesitation, and decree him to be alien from the bosom of Mother Church. Any one, therefore, whom this my confession does not bring to a right <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, no longer loves the synod of Chalcedon, but <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the bosom of Mother Church. If then those who appear to have been thus daring have presumed thus to speak in <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it remains for them, having received this satisfaction, to return to the unity of your Fraternity, and not divide themselves from the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> universal Church.</p>
