<h1>Book IV, Letter 30</h1>

<p> <em>To Constantina Augusta.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Constantina, etc.</p>

<p>The Serenity of your Piety, conspicuous for religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, has charged me with your commands to send to you the head of Saint <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, or some other part of his body, for the church which is being built in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the same Saint <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the palace. And, being desirous of receiving commands from you, by exhibiting the most ready <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to which I might the more provoke your favour towards me, I am all the more distressed that I neither can nor dare do what you enjoin. For the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> Saint Peter and Saint <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> glitter with so great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and terrors in their churches that one cannot even go to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> there without great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. In short, when my predecessor, of blessed memory, was desirous of changing the silver which was over the most sacred body of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, though at a distance of almost fifteen feet from the same body, a sign of no small dreadfulness appeared to him. Nay, I too wished in like manner to amend something not far from the most sacred body of Saint <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle; and, it being necessary to dig to some depth near his sepulchre, the superintendent of that place found some bones, which were not indeed connected with the same sepulchre; but, inasmuch as he presumed to lift them and transfer them to another place, certain awful signs appeared, and he died suddenly.</p>

<p>Besides all this, when my predecessor, of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, was desiring in like manner to make some improvements not far from the body of Saint Laurence the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, it not being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> where the venerable body was laid, diggings were made in the course of search, and suddenly his sepulchre was unawares disclosed; and those who were present and working, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <em>mansionarii</em> , who saw the body of the same <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, which they did not indeed presume to touch, all died within ten days, so that none might survive who had seen the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body of that righteous man.</p>

<p>Moreover, let my most tranquil lady <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is not the custom of the Romans, when they give relics of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, to presume to touch any part of the body; but only a cloth (<em>brandeum</em>) is put into a box (<em><a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyxide</a></em>), and placed near the most sacred bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: and when it is taken up it is deposited with due reverence in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that is to be dedicated, and such powerful effects are thereby produced there as might have been if their bodies had been brought to that special place. Whence it came to pass in the times of Pope Leo, of blessed memory, as has been handed down from our forefathers, that, certain Greeks being in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about such relics, the aforesaid pontiff took scissors and cut this same cloth (<em>brandeum</em>), and from the very incision blood flowed. For in the Roman and all the Western parts it is unendurable and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> for any one by any chance to desire to touch the bodies of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: and, if one should presume to do this, it is certain that this temerity will by no means remain unpunished. For this reason we greatly wonder at the custom of the Greeks, who say that they take up the bones of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; and we scarcely <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it. For certain Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who came here more than two years ago dug up in the silence of night near the church of Saint <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, bodies of dead men lying in the open field, and laid up their bones to be kept in their own possession till their departure. And, when they were taken and diligently examined as to why they did this, they confessed that they were going to carry those bones to Greece to pass for relics of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. From this instance, as has been already said, the greater <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> has been engendered in us whether it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that they really take up the bones of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as they are said to do.</p>

<p>But what shall I say of the bodies of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, when it is well known that, at the time when they suffered, <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> came from the East to recover their bodies as being those of their own countrymen? And, having been taken as far as the second milestone from the city, they were deposited in the place which is called Catacumbas. But, when the whole multitude came together and endeavoured to remove them thence, such <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of thunder and lightning terrified and dispersed them that they on no account presumed to attempt such a thing again. And then the Romans, who of the Lord's loving-kindness were counted worthy to do this, went out and took up their bodies, and laid them in the places where they are now deposited.</p>

<p>Who then, most serene lady, can there be so venturesome as, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> these things, to presume, I do not say to touch their bodies, but even at all to look at them? Such orders therefore having been given me by you, which I could by no means have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, it has not, so far as I find, been of your own motion; but certain men have wished to stir up your Piety against me, so as to withdraw from me (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) the favour of your good will, and have therefore sought out a point in which I might be found as if disobedient to you. But I trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that your most kind good will is in no way being stolen away from me, and that you will always have with you the power of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, whom with all your heart and mind you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, not from their bodily presence, but from their protection.</p>

<p>Moreover, the napkin, which you have likewise ordered to be sent you, is with his body, and so cannot be touched, as his body cannot be approached. But since so religious a desire of my most serene lady ought not to be wholly unsatisfied, I will make haste to transmit to you some portion of the chains which Saint Peter the apostle himself bore on his neck and his hands, from which many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are displayed among the people; if at least I should succeed in removing it by filing. For, while many come frequently to seek a blessing from these same chains, in the hope of receiving a little part of the filings, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> attends with a file, and in the case of some seekers a portion comes off so quickly from these chains that there is no delay: but in the case of other seekers the file is drawn for long over the chains, and yet nothing can be got from them. In the month of June, Indiction 12.</p>
