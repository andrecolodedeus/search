<h1>Book IV, Letter 31</h1>

<p> <em>To Theodorus, Physician.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Theodorus, Physician to the Emperor.</p>

<p>I myself give thanks to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that distance does not separate the hearts of those who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> each other mutually. For lo, most sweet and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> son, we are far apart in body, and yet are present with each other in charity. This your works, this your letters testify, this I experienced in you when present, this I recognize in your Glory when absent. May this make you both beloved of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and worthy for ever before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>. For, charity being the mother of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, you bring forth the fruits of good works for this reason that you keep in your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the very root of those fruits. Now what you have sent me, God inspiring you, for the redemption of captives, I confess that I have received both with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and with sorrow. With <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that is, for you, whom I thus perceive to be preparing a mansion in the heavenly country; but with exceeding sorrow for myself, who, over and above my care of the property of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, must now also give an account of the property of my most sweet son, the Lord Theodorus, and be held responsible for having spent it carefully or negligently. But may Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has poured into your mind the bowels of His own mercy, who has granted to you to take anxious thought for what is said of our Saviour by the excellent preacher&mdash; <em>That, though he was rich, yet for us he became poor</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 8:9</a></span>&mdash; may He, at the coming of the same Saviour, show you to be rich in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to stand free from all fault, and grant to you heavenly for earthly joys, abiding joys for transitory.</p>

<p>As to what you say you desire to be done for you near the most sacred body of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, be assured that, though your tongue were silent, your charity bids the doing of it. Would indeed that we were worthy to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you: but that I am not worthy I have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Still, however, there are here many worthy folk, who are being redeemed from the enemy by your offering, and serve our Creator faithfully, with regard to whom you have done what is written; <em>Lay up <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and it shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir029.htm#verse15">Sirach 29:15</a></span>.</p>

<p>But, since he loves the more who presumes the more, I have some complaint against the most sweet disposition of my most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> son the Lord Theodorus; namely that he has received from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Trinity the gift of genius, the gift of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, the gift of mercy and charity, and yet is unceasingly bound up in secular causes, is occupied in continual processions, and neglects to read daily the words of his Redeemer. For what is sacred Scripture but a kind of epistle of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> to His creature? And surely, if your Glory were resident in any other place, and were to receive letters from an earthly emperor, you would not loiter, you would not rest, you would not give sleep to your eyes, till you had learned what the earthly emperor had written.</p>

<p>The Emperor of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, the Lord of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, has sent you his epistles for your life's behoof; and yet, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> son, you neglect to read these epistles ardently. Study then, I beseech you, and daily meditate on the words of your Creator. Learn the heart of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may sigh more ardently for the things that are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be kindled with greater longings for heavenly joys. For a man will have the greater rest here in proportion as he has now no rest in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of his Maker. But, that you may act thus, may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> pour into you the Spirit the Comforter: may He fill your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with His presence, and in filling it, compose it.</p>

<p>As to me, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I suffer here many and innumerable bitternesses. But I give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that I suffer far less than I deserve.</p>

<p>I commend to your Glory my son, your patient, the lord Narses. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indeed that you hold him as in all respects commended to you; but I beg you to do what you are doing, that, in asking for what I see is being done, I may by my asking have a share in your reward. Furthermore, I have received the blessing  of your Excellency with the charity wherewith it was sent to me. And I have presumed to send you, in acknowledgment of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, a duck with two small ducklings, that, as often as your eye is led to look at it, the memory also of me may be recalled to you among the occupations and tumults of business.</p>
