<h1>Book IV, Letter 36</h1>

<p> <em>To Leo, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Leo, Bishop of Catana. </p>

<p>We have found from the report of many that a custom has of old obtained among you, for subdeacons to be allowed to have intercourse with their wives. That any one should any more presume to do this was prohibited by the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of our see, under the authority of our predecessor , in this way; that those who at that time had been coupled to wives should choose one of two things, that is, either to abstain from their wives, or on no account whatever presume to exercise their ministry. And, according to report, Speciosus, then a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, did for this reason suspend himself from the office of administration, and up to the time of his death bore indeed the office of a notary, but ceased from the ministry which a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> should have exercised. After his death we have learned that his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, Honorata, has been relegated to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by your Fraternity for having associated herself with a husband. And so if, as is said, her husband suspended himself from ministration, it ought not to be to the prejudice of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that she has contracted a second marriage, especially if she had not been joined to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> with the intention of abstaining from the pleasures of the flesh.</p>

<p>If, then, you find the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be as we have been informed, it is right for you to release altogether the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, that she may be at liberty to return without any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to her husband.</p>

<p>But for the future let your Fraternity be exceedingly careful, in the case of any who may be promoted to this office, to look to this with the utmost diligence, that, if they have wives, they shall enjoy no licence to have intercourse with them: but you must still strictly order them to observe all things after the pattern of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>.</p>
