<h1>Book IV, Letter 38</h1>

<p> <em>To Queen Theodelinda.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Theodelinda, Queen of the Lombards. </p>

<p>It has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from the report of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that your Glory has been led on by some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> even to the offense against <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church of suspending yourself from the communion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unanimity. Now the more we sincerely <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, the more seriously are we distressed about you, that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unskilled and foolish men, who not only do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what they talk about, but can hardly understand what they have heard; who, while they neither read themselves, nor <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those who do, remain in the same <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which they have themselves feigned to themselves concerning us. For we venerate the four <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synods; the Nicene, in which <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, the Constantinopolitan, in which Macedonius, the first Ephesine, in which <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, and the Chalcedonians, in which Eutyches and Dioscorus, were condemned; declaring that whosoever thinks otherwise than these four synods did is alien from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. We also condemn whomsoever they condemn, and absolve whomsoever they absolve, smiting, with interposition of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, any one who presumes to add to or take away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the same four synods, and especially that of Chalcedon, with respect to which <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and occasion of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> has arisen in the minds of certain unskilled men.</p>

<p>Seeing, then, that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the integrity of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from my plain utterance and profession, it is right that you should have no further scruple of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> with respect to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: but persist in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and make your life firm on the rock of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; that is on the confession of the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, lest all those tears of yours and all those good works should come to nothing, if they are found alien from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For as branches dry up without the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the root, so works, to whatsoever degree they may seem good, are nothing, if they are disjoined from the solidity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>It therefore becomes your Glory to send a communication with all speed to our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Constantius, of whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and life I have long been well assured, and to signify by your letters addressed to him how kindly you accept his ordination, and that you are in no wise separated from the communion of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that we may <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with a common exultation, as for a good and faithful daughter. Know also that you and your works will please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if, before his assize comes, they be approved by the judgment of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</p>
