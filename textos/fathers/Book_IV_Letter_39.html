<h1>Book IV, Letter 39</h1>

<p> <em>To Constantius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Constantius, Bishop of Mediolanum (<em>Milan</em>).</p>

<p>Having read the letter of your Holiness, we find that you are in a state of serious distress, principally on account of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and citizens of Briscia (<em>Brescia</em>) who bid you send them a letter in which you are asked to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> that you have not condemned the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>.  Now, if your Fraternity's predecessor Laurentius did not do this, it ought not to be required of you. But, if he did it, he was not with the universal Church, and contradicted what he had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> to in his security.  But, inasmuch as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him to have kept his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and to have continued in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he did not <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> to any of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that he had not condemned the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>. Hence your Holiness may conclude that you ought not to be forced to do what was in no wise done by your predecessor. But, lest those who have thus written to you should be offended, send them a letter declaring under interposition of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> that you neither take away anything from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the synod of Chalcedon nor received those who do, and that you condemn whomsoever it condemned, and absolve whomsoever it absolved. And thus I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they may be very soon satisfied. </p>

<p>Further, as to what you write about many of them being offended because you name our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ravenna during the solemnities of mass, you should enquire into the ancient custom; and, if it has been the custom, it ought not now to be found fault with by foolish men. But, if it has not been the custom, a thing ought not to be done at which some may possibly take offense. Yet I have been at pains to make careful enquiry whether the same John our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> names you at the altar; and they say that this is not done. And, if he does not make mention of your name, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what necessity obliges you to make mention of his. If indeed it can be done without any one taking offense, your doing anything of this kind is very laudable, since you show the charity you have towards your brethren.</p>

<p>Further, as to what you write of your having been unwilling to transmit my letter to Queen Theodelinda on the ground that the fifth synod was named in it, if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that she might thereby be offended, you did right in not transmitting it. We are therefore doing now as you recommend, namely, that we should only express approval of the four synods. Yet, as to the synod which was afterwards held in Constantinople, called by many the fifth, I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it neither ordained nor held anything in opposition to the four most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synods, seeing that nothing was done in it with respect to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but only with respect to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, too, about whom nothing is contained in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>  but, after the canons had been promulged, discussion arose, and final action was ventilated concerning <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Yet still we have done as you desired, making no mention of this synod. But we have also written to our daughter the queen what you wrote to us about the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Ursicinus, who wrote something to you against our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John, you ought by your letters addressed to him, with sweetness and reason, to restrain from his intention. Further, concerning Fortunatus , we desire your Fraternity to be careful, lest you be in any way surreptitiously influenced by bad men. For I hear that he ate at the table of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with your predecessor Laurentius for many years until now, that he sat among the nobles, and subscribed, and that with our brother's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he served in the army. And now, after so many years, your Fraternity thinks that he should be driven from the position which he now occupies. This seems to me altogether incongruous. And so I have given you this order through him, but privately. Still, if there is anything reasonable that can be alleged against him, it ought to be submitted to our judgment. But, if it please Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we will send letters through your man to our son the Lord Dynamius.</p>
