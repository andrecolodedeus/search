<h1>Book IV, Letter 4</h1>

<p> <em>To Queen Theodelinda.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Theodelinda, Queen of the Lombards. </p>

<p>It has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the report of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that your Glory has been led on by some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> even to such an offense against <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church as to withdraw yourself from the communion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unanimity. Now the more we sincerely <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, the more seriously are we distressed about you, that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unskilled and foolish men, who not only do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what they talk about, but can hardly understand what they have heard.</p>

<p>For they say that in the times of Justinian of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, some things were ordained contrary to the council of Chalcedon; and, while they neither read themselves nor <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those who do, they remain in the same <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which they themselves feigned to themselves concerning us. For we, our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, declare that nothing was altered, nothing violated, with respect to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of this same <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council of Chalcedon; but that whatever was done in the times of the aforesaid Justinian was so done that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the council of Chalcedon should in no respect be disturbed. Further, if any one presumes to speak or think anything contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the said synod, we detest his opinion, with interposition of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. Since then you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the integrity of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> under the attestation of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, it remains that you should never separate yourself from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, lest all those tears of yours, and all those good works should come to nothing, if they are found alien from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It therefore becomes your Glory to send a communication with all speed to my most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Constantius, of whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as well as his life, I have long been well assured, and to signify by your letters addressed to him how kindly you have accepted his ordination, and that you are in no way separated from the communion of his Church; although I think that what I say on this subject is superfluous: for, though there has been some degree of doubtfulness in your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, I think that it has been removed from your heart on the arrival of my son John the abbot, and Hippolytus the notary.</p>
