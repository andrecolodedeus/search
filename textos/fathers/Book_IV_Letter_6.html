<h1>Book IV, Letter 6</h1>

<p> <em>To Cyprian, Deacon.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Cyprian, Deacon and Rector of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.</p>

<p>It has been reported to us that a native of the province of Lucania, Petronilla by name, was converted  through the exhortation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Agnellus, and that all her property, though she had it in her own power, she nevertheless bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which she entered even by a special deed of gift: also that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> died leaving half of his substance to one Agnellus, his son, who is said to be a notary of our Church, and half to the said <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. But, when they had fled for refuge to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> because of the calamity impending on <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the above-named Agnellus is said to have corrupted her morals and defiled her, and, finding her with child, to have seduced her from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and to have taken away with her all her belongings, both those that had been her own and such as she might have had given her by his own father, and that, after perpetrating such and so great a crime, he claims these things as his own. We therefore exhort your Love to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the aforesaid man, and the above-named <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, to be summarily brought before you, and to institute a most thorough enquiry into the case. And, if you should find it to be as reported to us, determine an affair defiled by so many iniquities with the utmost severity of expurgation; to the end that both strict retribution may overtake the above-named man, who has regarded neither his own nor her condition, and that, she having been first punished and consigned to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under penance, all the property that had been taken away from the oft above-named place, with all its fruits and accessions, may be restored.</p>
