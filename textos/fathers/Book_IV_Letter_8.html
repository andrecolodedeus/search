<h1>Book IV, Letter 8</h1>

<p> <em>To Januarius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Januarius, Bishop of Caralis (<em>Cagliari</em>).</p>

<p>We think indeed that your position may in itself be enough to compel you to be instant in the fulfilment of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> duties. But, lest remissness of any kind should intervene to abate your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, we have thought it right to exhort you especially with regard to them. Now it has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that your Stephen, when departing this life, by his last will and testament directed a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to be founded. But it is said that his desire is so far unaccomplished owing to the delay of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> lady Theodosia, his heiress. Wherefore we exhort your Fraternity to pay the utmost attention to this matter, and admonish the above-named lady, to the end that within a year's space she may establish a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> as has been directed, and construct everything without dispute according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the departed. But if she should put off the completion of the design out of negligence or artfulness (as, for instance, if she is unable to found it in the place that had been appointed, and it is thought fit that it be placed elsewhere, and the matter is neglected through the intervening delay), then we desire that it be built by the diligence of your Fraternity, and that, all things being set in order, the effects and revenues that have been left be appropriated by you to this venerable place. For so you will both escape condemnation for remissness before the awful Judge, and, in accordance with our most religious <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, will be accomplishing with episcopal <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> wishes of the departed, which had been disregarded. </p>
