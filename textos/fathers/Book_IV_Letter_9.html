<h1>Book IV, Letter 9</h1>

<p> <em>To Januarius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Januarius, Bishop of Caralis (Cagliari).</p>

<p>Pastoral <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> ought indeed in itself to have sufficiently instigated you, even without our aid, to protect profitably and providently the flock of which you have taken charge, and to preserve it with diligent circumspection from the cunning devices of enemies. But, since we have found that your Charity needs also the written word of our authority for the augmentation of your firmness, it is necessary for us, by the exhortation of brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, to strengthen your faltering disposition towards the earnestness of religious activity.</p>

<p>Now it has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that you are remiss in your guardianship of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the handmaidens of God situated in Sardinia; and, though it had been prudently arranged by your predecessors that certain approved men of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should have the charge of attending to their needs, this has now been so entirely neglected that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> specially dedicated to God are compelled to go in person among public functionaries about tributes and other liabilities, and are under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of running to and fro through villages and farms for making up their taxes, and of mixing themselves unsuitably in business which belongs to men. This <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> let your Fraternity remove by an easy correction; that is, by carefully deputing one man of approved life and manners, and of such age and position as to give rise to no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suspicion of him, who may, with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so assist the inmates of these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> that they may no longer be allowed to wander, against rule, for any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatever, private or public, beyond their venerable precincts; but that whatever has to be done in their behalf may be transacted reasonably by him whom you shall depute. But let the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> themselves, rendering praises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and confining themselves to their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, no longer suggest any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suspicion to the minds of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. But if any one of them, either through former license, or through an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom of impunity, has been seduced, or should in future be led, into the gulph of adulterous lapse, we will that, after enduring the severity of adequate punishment, she be consigned for penance to some other stricter <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, that she may there give herself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, and profit herself by penitence, and afford an example of the more rigorous kind of discipline, such as may inspire <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in others. Further, let any one who may be detected in any iniquity with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of this class be deprived of communion, if he be a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>; but, if he be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, let him also be removed from his office, and thrust into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for his ever to be deplored excesses.</p>

<p>We also desire you to hold councils of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> twice in the year, as is said to have been the custom of your province, as well as being ordered by the authority of the sacred canons; that, if any among them be of moral character inconsistent with his profession, he may be convicted by the friendly rebuke of his brethren, and also that measures may be taken with paternal circumspection for the security of the flock committed to him, and for the well-being of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. It has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> also that male and female slaves of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who have fled for refuge to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on account of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, are either restored to their unbelieving masters, or paid for according to their value in lieu of being restored. We exhort therefore that thou by no means allow so bad a custom to continue; but that whosoever being a slave to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, shall have fled for refuge to venerable places, thou suffer him not in any degree to sustain prejudice. But, whether he had been a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> before, or been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> now, let him be supported in his claim for freedom, without any loss to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, by the patronage of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> compassion.</p>

<p>Let not <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> presume to sign <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> infants a second time on the forehead with chrism; but let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> anoint those who are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> on the breast, that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may afterwards anoint them on the forehead. </p>

<p>With regard also to founding <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, which various <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have ordered to be built, if you perceive that any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom the charge has been assigned put it off on <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> pretexts, we desire you to insist sagaciously according to what the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> enjoin, lest (as God forbid should be the case) the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> retentions of the departed should be frustrated through your neglect. Further, as to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which Peter is said to have formerly ordered to be constructed in his house, we have seen fit that your Fraternity should make accurate enquiry into the amount of the revenues there. And in case of there being a suitable provision, when all diminutions of the property and what is said to have been dispersed have been recovered, let the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with all diligence and without any delay be founded. But, if the means are insufficient or detrimental , we desire you, after closely investigating everything as has been commanded, to send a report to us, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to deliberate with the Lord's help with regard to its construction. Let, then, your Fraternity give wise attention to all the points above referred to, so as neither to be found to have transgressed the tenour of our admonitions nor to stand liable to divine judgment for too little <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in your pastoral office.</p>
