<h1>Book IX, Letter 106</h1>

<p> <em>To Syagrius, &AElig;therius, Virgilius, and Desiderius, Bishops</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Syagrius of Augustodunum (<em>Autun</em>), Etherius of Lugdunum (<em><a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a></em>), Virgilius of Aretale (<em>Arles</em>), and Desiderius of Vienna (<em>Vienne</em>), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>. <em>A paribus</em>.</p>

<p>Our Head, which is Christ, has to this end willed us to be His members, that through the bond of charity and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> He might make us one body in Himself. And to Him it befits us so to adhere in heart, that, since without Him we can be nothing, through Him we may be able to be what we are called. Let nothing divide us from the citadel of our Head, lest, if we refuse to be His members, we be left apart from Him, and wither like branches cast off from the vine. Wherefore, that we may be counted worthy to be the dwelling-place of our Redeemer, let us abide in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with entire earnestness of mind. For He Himself says, <em>He that loves me will keep my word, and my Father will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse23">John 14:23</a></span>. But, since we cannot keep close to the author of all good, unless we cut away from us <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, we therefore by these present writings (which associate us together mutually as in the alternate discourse of a wished for visitation) approach your Fraternity in accordance with apostolic institutes, that, leaning on the rules of the Fathers and the Lord's commands, we may banish from the temple of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, which is the service of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, so as to suffer nothing hurtful, and nothing disorderly, to be in the house of the Lord.</p>

<p>I apprize you to wit, that we have long heard it currently reported how that in the regions of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> sacred orders are conferred through simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. And we are affected with sorrowful disgust, if money has any place in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices, and that which is sacred is made secular. Whosoever, then, sets himself to buy this thing by the giving of a price, having regard not to the office but to the title, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> not to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but only to be called one. What forsooth? What comes of this but that there is no trial of a man's conduct, no carefulness about his moral character, no enquiry into his life, but that he only is counted worthy who has the means to give a price? Hence it ensues, if the matter be weighed in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> balance, that, while one wickedly makes haste to snatch a place of utility with a view to vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, he is all the more unworthy from the very fact of his seeking dignity. Moreover, as one who refuses when invited and flies when sought should be brought up to the sacred altar, so one that sues of his own accord and pushes himself forward importunately should without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> be repelled. For whoever thus strives to climb to higher places, what does he but decrease in increasing, and in rising outwardly sink low inwardly? Wherefore, dearest brethren, in ordaining <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> let sincerity prevail, let there be simple consent without venality, let a pure election be preferred, so that advancement to the highest place of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> may be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be due, not to the suffrage of sellers, but to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For that it is a grievous crime to wish to procure or to sell the gift of God for a price evangelical authority is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm">Matthew 21</a></span>.</p>

<p>For, when our Lord and Redeemer went into the temple, He overthrew the seats of them that sold doves. What else is it to sell doves but to receive a price for the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>, and to put to sale the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> gives to men? And that the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of such as do so falls before the eyes of God is plainly signified by the overthrowing of the seats. And yet the perverseness of this iniquity still puts forth its strength. For it drives those to sell whom it deceives into buying. And, while attention is not paid to what is enjoined by the divine voice, <em>Freely you have received, freely give</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse8">Matthew 10:8</a></span>, it is brought to pass that it increases, and becomes doubled in one and the same contagion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to wit of the buyer and of the seller. And, it being well known that this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> crept into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with a pestiferous root before all others, and was condemned in its very origin by apostolic detestation, why is it not guarded against? Why is it not considered that blessing is turned into a curse to him who is promoted to the end that he may become a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>?</p>

<p>For the most part, then, the adversary of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, when unable to insinuate into them what is wrong on the face of it, endeavours to supplant them by throwing over it as it were a show of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and persuades them, perhaps, that money ought to be received from those who have it, so that there may be wherewith to give to those who have it not, if only he may even so infuse mortal poisons concealed under the appearance of almsgiving. For neither would the hunter deceive the wild beast, nor the fowler the bird, nor the fisherman catch the fish, if the former were to set their snares in open view, or if the latter had not his hook hidden by the bait. By all means, then, the cunning of the enemy is to be feared and guarded against, lest those whom he cannot subvert by open <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> he should succeed in slaying more cruelly by a hidden weapon. For indeed it is not to be accounted almsgiving if that be dispensed to the poor which is got by unlawful dealings, since he who with this intention receives amiss as though with the view of dispensing well is the worse for it rather than the better. The <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> that please the eyes of our Redeemer are not those that are gathered together in unlawful ways and from iniquity, but such as are bestowed out of what has been granted to us and well acquired. Hence this also is certain, that, though <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> or hospitals or anything else be built with the money given for sacred orders, it profits not for reward; since, when one that is perverse and a buyer of dignity is transferred to a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, and constitutes others after the likeness of himself for a consideration given, he destroys more by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> administration than he who has received money from him for ordination can build up. That we should not, then, try to get anything with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> under pretence of almsgiving we are plainly warned by <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, which says, <em>The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the impious are abominable which are offered of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse27">Proverbs 21:27</a></span>. For whatever in God's <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is offered of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> appeases not, but provokes, the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>. Hence again it is written, <em>Honour the Lord from your just labours</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse9">Proverbs 3:9</a></span>. Whoso, then, takes evilly that he may, as he supposes, give well, it is evident without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he honours not the Lord. Hence also it is said through Solomon, <em>Whoso offers a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the substance of the poor is as though he slew a son in his father's sight</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse24">Sirach 34:24</a></span>. Now let us consider how great is a father's grief if his son be killed in his sight: and hence we easily understand how much God is grieved when a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is given Him out of pillage. Exceedingly to be shunned then, most beloved brethren, is the perpetration of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> under pretence of almsgiving. For it is one thing to do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but another to commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.</p>

<p>This also, which has reached our ears, we include as worthy of no dissimilar detestation; that some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, inflated with desire of dignity, are tonsured on the death of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and from being <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> are suddenly made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and shamelessly snatch at the leadership of religious life, not having as yet even learned to be soldiers. What good do we suppose these will do their subjects, who, before touching the threshold of discipleship, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not to occupy the place of mastership? In such a case it is needful that, even though any one were of unquestioned merit, he should be exercised in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices by passing through distinct orders. He should see what he is to imitate, he should be formed into the shape he is to retain, so that afterwards he may not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, when chosen for showing the way of life to the erring. He should, then, be polished long by religious meditation, that he may be well-pleasing, and so shine as a candle placed on a candlestick that the adverse force of winds driving against the kindled flame of erudition may not extinguish it, but increase it. For, since it is written, <em>That one should first be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and so minister</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse10">1 Timothy 3:10</a></span>, much more ought he first to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> who is taken as an intercessor for the people, lest bad <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should become the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the people's ruin. There can therefore be no excuse, no defence against this, since it is clearly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all how solicitous about diligent attention to this matter is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and excellent teacher, who forbids that a novice should accede to sacred orders <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm">1 Timothy 3</a></span>. But, as then one was called a novice who had been newly planted in the conversation of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so one is now to be held to be a novice who, having been suddenly planted in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of religion, creeps on to canvass for sacred dignities. Orders, then, should be risen to in an orderly way: for he courts a fall who seeks to rise to the topmost heights of a place by steep ascents, disregarding the steps that lead to it. And, seeing that the same apostle teaches his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, among other directions with regard to sacred orders, that hands are to be laid hastily on no man <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm">1 Timothy 5</a></span>, what can be more hasty or what more headlong than to begin at the top, and that a man should commence by being a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> before he has been a minister? Whosoever, then, desires to obtain <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, not for the pomp of elation but for doing good, let him first measure his own strength with the burden he is to undergo, that, if unequal to it, he may abstain, and also approach it with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, even if he thinks himself sufficient for it.</p>

<p>Further, it will not be beside the mark, if, in addition to the argument from rational beings we draw one from our use of irrational things. For timber suitable for buildings is cut from forests, and yet the weight of the building is not imposed on them while they are yet green, or till a delay of many days has dried their greenness, and rendered them fit for necessary use. And, if by any chance this precaution is neglected, they are soon broken by the mass imposed upon them, and the material provided for support begets ruin.</p>

<p>For hence also medical men, whose care is for the body, do not offer certain remedies to him that needs them while recently concocted, but leave them to be macerated for some time. For, should any one give them immaturely, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the means of health become a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of danger. Let them learn, therefore, let <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in their office learn, those namely to whom the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is entrusted, to observe what men of various arts under the teaching of reason attend to, and restrain themselves from ambition, if not of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, yet at any rate of very shame.</p>

<p>But, lest perchance any one should still wish to defend himself on the pretext of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom, let the discretion of your Fraternity restrain them with the rein of reason, and not allow them to lapse into unlawful doings, since whatever is deserving of punishment ought not to be adduced as an example for imitation, but for correction.</p>

<p>Nor, further, can we suffer you to pass over neglectfully this other matter, which alike requires correction. For of what profit is it to have guarded all besides if through one place pernicious access be afforded to the enemy? Therefore let <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> be prohibited from living with those who are constituted in any sacred order. With regard to them, lest the old enemy of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> should exult, it must be laid down by the consent of all that they may have no other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with them but those whom the sacred canons include. And, though this interdiction is perhaps bitter for the time to some, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it will afterwards grow sweet from its very benefit to their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, if the enemy be overcome in that whereby he might have overcome them.</p>

<p>In this part of our solicitude also we must not leave unnoticed what has been ordained by the provision of the Fathers, for the sake of advantage, concerning the holding of councils throughout <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Wherefore, lest there should be any dissension among brethren, or any fomentation of discord between superiors and subordinates, it is necessary that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should assemble together, so that there may be discussion about cases that arise, and salutary conference about <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> observances; to the end that, while things past are corrected and things future regulated, the Almighty Lord may be praised on all sides in one accord by brethren. Know whose presence will be with you, seeing that it is written, <em>Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse20">Matthew 18:20</a></span>. If, then, He will vouchsafe to be present where there are two or three, how much more will He not be wanting where many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have come together? And indeed it is not unknown what is appointed by the rules of the Fathers as to the holding of a council twice in the year. But, lest haply any necessity should not allow this rule to be carried out, we decree that still one shall meet, without any excuse allowed, once; so that nothing wrong, nothing unlawful, may be ventured on while a council is being expected. For commonly, though not from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, yet from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of enquiry, people abstain from that which it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> may displease the judgment of all. Let us, most beloved brethren, keep this observance to be left to our posterity; and let us meditate on all that is written in the sacred writings for our instruction, and incite all we can to follow it. For it is certain that, if with all our heart we attend to these salutary precepts, we escape all taint of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, since, while we lean on these whereby we are built up, we shut out, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, all place for deception.</p>

<p>Therefore for the purposes mentioned above, we desire your Fraternity, God willing, to assemble a synod, and in it, through the mediation of our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Aregius , and our most beloved son Cyriacus, let all things that are, as we have before said, opposed to the sacred canons, be strictly condemned under the ban of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>; that is, that any one should presume to give any consideration for acquiring <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> orders, or receive any for conferring them; or that any one should all at once from a lay condition dare to enter on a place of rule; or that any other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> should live with <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> but such as are allowed, as aforesaid, by the sacred canons. Concerning all these things let our most reverend brother the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Syagrius, with the whole synod, when our most beloved brother Cyriacus returns to us, take care to send us word of what has been done; in order that, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> accurately what has been decreed, and with what safeguards and in what manner, we may render thanks without ceasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> for your life and manners.</p>
