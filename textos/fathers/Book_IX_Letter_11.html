<h1>Book IX, Letter 11</h1>

<p> <em>To Brunichild, Queen.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Brunichild, Queen of the Franks .</p>

<p>With what firmness the mind of your Excellency is settled in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> you show in a praiseworthy manner, among the other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that you do, by your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> also of His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; and great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is caused us, since you study to advance with honours those whom you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and venerate as being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Christ's servants. For it becomes you, most excellent daughter,  it becomes you to be such as to be able to subject yourself to a lord above you. For in submitting the neck of your mind to the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Almighty Lord you confirm your dominion also over subject nations, and by subjecting yourself to the service of the Creator you bind your subjects the more devotedly to yourself. Wherefore, having received your letters, we signify to you that your Excellency's earnest desire has greatly pleased us, and we have been desirous of sending the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> to our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Syagrius , inasmuch as the disposition of our most serene lord the Emperor is also favourable, and, so far as we have been informed by our <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who was the representative of our Church at his Court, he is altogether desirous that this thing should be granted , and many good reports have reached us of our aforesaid brother both on your testimony and that of others; and especially we learned what his life is from John the Regionarius  on his return to us. And hearing what he did in the case of our brother Augustine, we bless our Redeemer, because we feel that he fulfils in his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> the meaning of his name of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</p>

<p>But there have been many hindrances which have meanwhile prevented us from doing this thing. First indeed, that he who had come to receive this <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> is implicated in the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the schismatics ; further, that you wished it to be understood that it was sent, not on your petition, but from ourselves. But there was this besides; that neither had he who desires to use it requested it to be granted him by a special petition addressed to us: and it was by no means right for us to concede so great a matter without his request; especially as an ancient custom has obtained, that the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> shall not be given except when the merits of a case demand it, and to one who urgently requests it. Still, lest we should seem perchance to wish, under pretext of any excuse, to put off the desire of your Excellency, we have provided for the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> being sent to our most beloved son Candidus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, charging him, with befitting precaution, to deliver it in our stead. Hence it is requisite that our above-written brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Syagrius must hope for it, when he has of his own motion drawn up a petition with some of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and this he must give to the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, to the end that he may be in a position to obtain properly the use of the same <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> with the favour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>In order, then, that the charge you bear may be of fruit to you before the eyes of our Creator, let the solicitude of your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> be diligently on the watch, and suffer no one who is under your dominion to attain to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders by the giving of money, or the patronage of any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whatever, or by right of relationship; but let such a one be elected to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, or to the office of any other sacred order, as his life and manners have shown to be worthy; lest if, as we do not expect, the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> should be venal, simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which was the first to come up in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and has been condemned by the sentence of the Fathers, should arise in your parts, and (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) should weaken the powers of your kingdom. For it is a serious matter, and a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> beyond what can be told, to sell the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who redeemed all things.</p>

<p>But let this also be your care, that, since, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, the excellent preacher entirely forbids a novice to accede to the ruling position of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, you suffer no one to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from being a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. For what sort of master will he be who has not been a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>? Or what kind of leadership can he supply to the Lord's flock who has not been previously subjected to a shepherd's discipline? If, then, any one's life should be such as to show him worthy of being promoted to this order, he ought first to serve in the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to the end that by the experience of long practice he may see what to imitate, and learn what to teach; lest perchance the newness of his charge bear not the burden of government, and occasion of ruin arise from the immaturity of his promotion.</p>

<p>Moreover, how your Excellency conducted yourself towards our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Augustine, and how great charity, through the inspiration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you bestowed upon him, we have learned from the relation of various of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; for which we return thanks, and implore the mercy of Divine Power to keep  you here under its protection, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to reign, as among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so also after a course of many years in life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, those whom the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the schismatics severs from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, strive ye, for your own reward, to recall to the unity of concord. For on no other ground are they enveloped so far in the blindness of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> but that they may escape <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline, and have licence to live perversely as they please, since they understand neither what they defend nor what they follow. But as for us, we venerate and follow in all respects the synod of Chalcedon, from which they take to themselves the clouds of a pestiferous excuse; and, if any one should presume to diminish or add anything with regard to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> thereof, we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> him. But they are so impregnated with the taint of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that, giving credence to their own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, they reject the universal Church, and all the four patriarchs, not with reason, but with malicious intent; so that he who was sent to us by your Excellency, when he was asked by us why he stood separated from the universal Church, acknowledged that he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But neither what he said nor what else he gave ear to had he the power of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>. As to this also we no less exhort you, that you should restrain the rest of your subjects under the control of discipline from <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, being worshippers of trees, or exhibiting <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the heads of animals; seeing that it has come to our ears that many of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> both resort to the churches and also (horrible to relate!) do not give up their worshipping of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But, since these things are altogether displeasing to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He does not own divided minds, provide ye for their being salubriously restrained from these unlawful practices; lest (God forbid it!) the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> serve not for their rescue, but for their punishment. If therefore you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of any that are violent, if of any that are adulterers, if of any that are thieves, or bent on other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, make haste to appease God by their correction, that He may not bring upon you the scourge due to unfaithful races, which, so far as we see, is already lifted up for the punishment of many nations; lest, if&mdash; as we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> will be the case&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of Divine vengeance should be kindled by the doings of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, the plague of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> should destroy the sinners whom the precepts of God recall not to the way of rectitude. We must, then, needs make haste, with all earnestness and continual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, to betake ourselves to the mercy of our Redeemer, wherein there is a place of safety and great security for all. For whoso steadfastly abides there, him danger crushes not, nor <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> alarms.</p>

<p>We have sent the volume, as you desired us by letter, to our aforesaid most beloved son Candidus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, to be offered to you, being in haste to be sharers in your good purpose. May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> keep you under His protection, and by His outstretched arm defend your kingdom from unbelieving nations, and bring you after long courses of years to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> joys. Given in the month of October, the first indiction .</p>
