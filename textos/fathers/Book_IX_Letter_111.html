<h1>Book IX, Letter 111</h1>

<p> <em>To Virgilius, Bishop of Arelate (Arles).</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Virgilius, etc.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the desire of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> purpose and the bent of a laudable devotion ought always to be aided by the earnest endeavours of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, anxious care should be taken that neither remissness, neglect nor presumption disturb whatever has been ordained for the quiet of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and of religious conversation. But, as it was right that what reason required should be profitably prescribed, so what has been prescribed ought not to be violated. Now Childebert of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> memory, King of the Franks, inflamed by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, in founding for his own reward a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for men within the walls of the city of Arelate, as we find set down in writing, granted certain things there for the sustentation of its inmates. And, lest his purpose should ever be frustrated, and what had been arranged for the quiet of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> be disturbed, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in his letters that whatever rights he conceded to the said <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> might be confirmed by <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> authority; adding this also to his petition, that certain privileges might at the same time be accorded to the same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, as well in the management of its affairs as in the ordination of its abbot. This he did as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> such reverence to be paid by the faithful to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> that what had been settled by its decree no molestation of unlawful usurpation would thereafter shake. Hence, since the royal purpose as well as the thing desired, urgently demanded effect to be given to it, letters were sent by our predecessor <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Vigilius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Roman See, to your predecessor Aurelius, wherein all things that a desire to embrace that purpose demanded were willingly confirmed by the support of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> authority, inasmuch as a thing of this kind, when requested, could not be allowed to encounter difficulty. But, that your Fraternity may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what was decreed at that time, we have seen to the written orders of our aforesaid predecessor being added to this letter. These having been perused, we exhort you to keep them all inviolate with <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> earnestness, as becomes you, and to allow nothing undue or unlawful to be imposed on that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, or the said orders to be infringed by any usurpation. For, though what has once been sanctioned by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> has no lack of validity, yet we do, over and above, once more corroborate by our authority in all respects all things that were ordained by our predecessor for quiet in this matter. Let your Fraternity, then, so acquit yourself in observing them as both to shut out all occasion of disturbance, and also to persuade others to carry these things out, while you show yourself careful and devoted, as becomes you, in observing the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> will of the departed one.</p>
