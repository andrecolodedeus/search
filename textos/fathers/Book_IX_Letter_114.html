<h1>Book IX, Letter 114</h1>

<p> <em>To Virgilius and Syagrius, Bishops.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Virgilius, Bishop of Arelate (<em>Arles</em>), and Syagrius, Bishop of Augustodunum (<em>Autun</em>).</p>

<p>The nature of the office committed to me, dearest brethren, drives me to break out into a cry of grief, and to sharpen your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with the anxiety of charity, for that it is said that you in your parts have been too negligent and remiss, where the rectitude of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> ought to have inflamed your earnestness. Now it has come to our ears that a certain Syagria had entered on a religious life, having even changed her dress, and was afterwards united by force to a husband (a thing iniquitous to be told), and that you have been moved by no sorrow to interfere in her defence. If this is so, I groan for it the more heavily for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest with the Almighty Lord (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) you should have the office of hirelings, and not the merit of shepherds, as having left without a struggle a sheep in the mouth of the wolf to be torn. For what will you say, or what account will you give of yourselves to the future judge; you whom the lewdness of ravishment has not moved, whom regard to the religious habit has in no wise excited to stand up in defence, whom <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> consideration has not roused to protect the purity of virgin modesty? Even now, then, let your neglect return to your memory; let remembrance of this fault stir you, and consideration of your office impel you to exhortation of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. And, lest haply in course of time constraint should have passed into willing consent, let your tongue be her cure, and through your exhortations let her give herself diligently to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; let not the lamentations of penitence depart from her memory; let her exhibit a penitent heart to our Redeemer; and let her make amends with weeping for the loss of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, which in her body it was not allowed her to preserve.</p>

<p>Wherefore, inasmuch as the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> desires, as it is said, even now to devote her property to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> uses, we exhort you that she experience the favour and enjoy the support of your Fraternity in this thing, and that it be lawful for her, a competent portion being reserved for her children, to decide as she will about her substance. For without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> you do good yourselves, if you render aid to those who wish to do good. Consider, therefore, most beloved brethren, from how great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> these things which we speak proceed, and take them all in the same spirit of charity that inspires them. For, we being one body in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I burn with you in this which I feel to be to your hurt. And with what earnestness, and what affection I send you this epistle, may the Author of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> disclose to your hearts. And so let not this brotherly admonition distress you, since even a bitter cup is taken gladly, when offered with a view to health. Finally, dearest brethren, let us with united <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> implore the mercy of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He would favourably order our life in His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, to the end that we may both serve Him here as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should do, and be able to stand in His sight hereafter secure and without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>
