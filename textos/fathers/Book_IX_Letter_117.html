<h1>Book IX, Letter 117</h1>

<p> <em>To Brunichild, Queen of the Franks.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Brunichild, etc.</p>

<p>Whereas for the government of a kingdom valour stands in need of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and power of equity, nor for this purpose can one suffice without the other, with what great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your care for these things is resplendent is shown plainly enough by the fact of your governing crowds of nations so laudably. Who then, considering this, can distrust the goodness of your Excellency, or be doubtful of obtaining his request, when he thinks it right to ask for what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> you would willingly bestow upon your subjects? The bearer, then, of these presents, Hilarius , a servant of your Excellency, supposing that our intervention with your power will aid him, has requested to be supported by letters of commendation from us; holding it as certain that he will more abundantly obtain such favours as you grant to others if our intercession should speak for him. Accordingly, paying you our address of greeting with the affection of paternal charity, we beg that, as he states that he is labouring under adversities from the iniquity of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the protection of your Excellence may defend him; and, lest he should possibly be oppressed against reason, that by your command you would order him to be kept safe; that so, while no one's opposition shall have place <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> and of mere will, both we may return thanks for having obtained what rather for your own reward we request, and that the blessed Peter, Prince of the Apostles, whom you will venerate in us with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> devotion by granting what we ask, may recompense your Excellency.</p>
