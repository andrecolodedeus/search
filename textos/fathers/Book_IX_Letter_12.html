<h1>Book IX, Letter 12</h1>

<p> <em>To John, Bishop of Syracuse.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to John, etc.</p>

<p>One coming from <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> has told me that some friends of his, whether Greeks or Latins I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, as though moved by <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Roman Church, murmur about my arrangements [i.e. of divine service], saying, How can he be arranging so as to keep the Constantinopolitan Church in check, when in all respects he follows her usage? And, when I said to him, What usages of hers do we follow? He replied; you have caused <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> to be said at mass out of the season of Pentecost ; you have made appointment for the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacons</a> to proceed disrobed , and for Kyrie Eleison to be said, and for the Lord's Prayer to be said immediately after the canon. To him I replied, that in none of these things have we followed another Church.</p>

<p>For, as to our custom here of saying the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>, it is said to be derived from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Jerusalem by the tradition of the blessed Jerome in the time of pope Damasus of blessed memory; and accordingly in this matter we have rather curtailed the former usage which had been handed down to us here from the Greeks.</p>

<p>Further, as to my having caused the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacons</a> to proceed disrobed, this was the ancient usage of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But it pleased one of our pontiffs, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not which, to order them to proceed in linen tunics. For  have your Churches in any respect received their tradition from the Greeks? Whence, then, have they at the present day the custom of the subdeacons proceeding in linen tunics, except that they have received it from their mother, the Roman Church?</p>

<p>Further, we neither have said nor now say the Kyrie Eleison, as it is said by the Greeks: for among the Greeks all say it together; but with us it is said by the clerks, and responded to by the people; and as often as it is said, Christe Eleison is said also, which is not said at all among the Greeks. Further, in daily masses we suppress some things that are usually said, and say only Kyrie Eleison, Christe Eleison, so as to devote ourselves a little longer to these words of deprecation. But the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a> (<em>orationem Dominicam</em>) we say immediately after the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (<em>mox post precem</em>) for this reason, that it was the custom of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to consecrate the host of oblation to (<em>ad</em>) that same <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> only. And it seemed to me very unsuitable that we should say over the oblation a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which a scholastic had composed, and should not say the very <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>  which our Redeemer composed over His body and blood . But also the Lord's Prayer among the Greeks is said by all the people, but with us by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone. Wherein, then, have we followed the usages of the Greeks, in that we have either amended our own old ones or appointed new and profitable ones, in which, however, we are not shown to be imitating others? Wherefore, let your Charity, when an occasion presents itself, proceed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Catana; or in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Syracuse teach those who you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> or understand may possibly be murmuring with respect to this matter, holding a conference there, as though for a different purpose, and so desist not from instructing them. For as to what they say about the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople, who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it is subject to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, as both the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord the emperor and our brother the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city continually acknowledge? Yet, if this or any other Church has anything that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, I am prepared in what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to imitate even my inferiors, while prohibiting them from things unlawful. For he is foolish who thinks himself first in such a way as to scorn to learn whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things he may see.</p>
