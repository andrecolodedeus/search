<h1>Book IX, Letter 120</h1>

<p> <em>To Claudius in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a></em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Claudius, etc.</p>

<p>The renown of good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> being fragrant after the manner of ointment, the odour of your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> has extended from the Western parts as far as here. Besprinkled by the sweetness of which breath of air, I declare that I greatly loved one whom I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, and within the bosom of my heart seized you with the hand of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; nor did I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> without already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> him to be one whose good qualities I had learned. For of him who is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me by great intenseness of feeling, but remains unknown by bodily vision, I undoubtedly can say <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his person, though I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not his home. Now herein is a great assertion of your good repute, that your Glory is said to cleave sedulously to the excellent king of the Goths; since, while good men always displease bad ones, it is certain that you are good, who have pleased one that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For this reason, addressing you with the greeting that is due to you, I hope that you are being exercised in these things which you have begun, so that that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sentence of Solomon may be fulfilled in you&mdash; <em>The path of the just is as a shining light, and grows unto the perfect day</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse18">Proverbs 4:18</a></span>. For, now that the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shines upon us, and the sweetness of the heavenly kingdom discloses itself to our minds, it is indeed already day, but not yet perfect day. But it will then be perfect day, when there shall be no longer anything of the night of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. But do you grow unto the perfect day, that, until such time as the heavenly country shall appear, there may be spreading increase of good works here; to the end that in the retribution hereafter the fruit of reward may be by so much the greater as earnestness in labour has been increasing now. Wherefore we commend to your Glory our most beloved son Cyriacus, the Father of our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, that, after he has accomplished what has been enjoined him, there be no hindrance to delay his return. May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> guard you by the protection of His heavenly arm, and grant unto you to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> both now among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and after long courses of years among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>
