<h1>Book IX, Letter 121</h1>

<p> <em>To Leander, Bishop of Hispalis (Seville).</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Leander, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.</p>

<p>I have the epistle of your Holiness, written with the pen of charity alone. For what the tongue transferred to the paper had got its tincture from the heart. Good and wise men were present when it was read, and at once their bowels were stirred with emotion. Everyone began to seize you in his heart with the hand of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for that in that epistle the sweetness of your disposition was not to be heard, but seen. All severally were inflamed, and all admired, and the very fire of the hearers showed what had been the ardour of the speaker. For, unless torches burn themselves, they will not kindle others. We saw, then, with how great charity your mind was aflame, seeing that it so kindled others also. Your life indeed, which I always remember with great reverence, they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but the loftiness of your heart was manifest to them from the lowliness of your language. As to my life, this your epistle speaks of it as worthy of imitation by all: but may that which is not as it is said to be become so because it is said to be so, lest one should lie who is not wont to lie. In reply to this, however, I speak shortly the words of a certain good <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <em>Call me not Noemi, that is, fair; but call me Mara, for I am full of bitterness</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rut001.htm#verse20">Ruth 1:20</a></span>. For indeed, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, I am not today the man you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. For I confess that in advancing outwardly I have fallen much inwardly, and I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that I am of the number of those of whom it is written, <em>You cast them down while they were lifted up</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse18">Psalm 72:18</a></span> . For he is cast down when he is lifted up who advances in honours, and falls in manners. For I, following the ways of my Head, had determined to be the scorn of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and the outcast of the people, and to run in the lot of him of whom again it is said by the Psalmist, <em>The ascents in his heart he has disposed in the valley of tears</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse7">Psalm 83:7</a></span> ; that is, that I should ascend inwardly all the more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> as I lay outwardly the more humbly in the valley of tears. But now burdensome <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> much depresses me, innumerable cares din me, and, when my mind collects itself for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they cleave it with their assaults as if with a kind of swords. My heart has no rest. It lies prostrate in the lowest place, depressed by the weight of its cogitation. Either very rarely or not at all does the wing of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> raise it aloft. My sluggish <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is torpid, and, with temporal cares barking round it, already almost reduced to stupor, is forced now to deal with earthly things, and now even to dispense things that are carnal; nay sometimes, by force of disgust, is compelled to dispose of some things with accompanying guilt. Why should I say more? Overcome by its own weight, it sweats blood. For, unless <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were reckoned under the name of blood, the Psalmist would not say, <em>Deliver me from blood guiltiness</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse16">Psalm 50:16</a></span> . But, when we add <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, we fulfil this also which is said by another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <em>Blood has touched blood</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/hos004.htm#verse2">Hosea 4:2</a></span> For blood is said to touch blood when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is joined to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so as to multiply the load of iniquity. But in the midst of all this I implore you by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> to hold me who am fallen into the billows of perturbation with the hand of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For I sailed as it were with a prosperous breeze when I led a tranquil life in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>: but a storm, rising suddenly with gusty surges, caught me in its commotion, and I lost the prosperity of my voyage; for in loss of rest I suffered shipwreck. Lo, now I am tossed in the waves, and I seek for the plank of your intercession, that, not being counted worthy to reach port rich with my ship entire, I may at least after losses be brought to shore by the aid of a plank.</p>

<p>Your Holiness writes of being afflicted with the pains of gout, by continual suffering from which I too am grievously worn down. But comfort will be readily at hand, if amid the scourges under which we suffer we recall to mind whatever faults we have committed; and then we shall see that they are not scourges, but gifts, if by pain of the flesh we purge the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which we did for delight of the flesh.</p>

<p>Furthermore we have sent you, with the blessing of the blessed Peter, Prince of the Apostles, a <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, to be used only in celebration of Mass. In sending it to you I ought to admonish you much as to how you ought to live: but I suppress speech, since in your manner of life you anticipate my words. May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> keep you under His protection, and bring you to the rewards of the heavenly country with multiplied fruits of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. As to me, with what amount of business and with what weakness I am weighed down this short letter bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, in which I say little to one whom I greatly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>
