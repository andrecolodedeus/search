<h1>Book IX, Letter 122</h1>

<p> <em>To Rechared, King of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a></em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Rechared, etc.</p>

<p>I cannot express in words, most excellent son, how much I am delighted with your work and your life. For on hearing of the power of a new <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> in our days, to wit that the whole nation of the Goths has through your Excellency been brought over from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to the firmness of a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, one is disposed to exclaim with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <em>This is the change wrought by the right hand of the Most High</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa076.htm#verse11">Psalm 76:11</a></span> . For whose breast, even though stony, would not, on hearing of so great a work, soften in praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of your Excellency? As for me, I declare that it delights me often to tell these things that have been done through you to my sons who resort to me and often together with them to admire. These things also for the most part stir me up against myself, in that I languish sluggish and unprofitable in listless ease, while kings are labouring in the gathering together of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for the gains of the heavenly country. What then shall I say to the coming Judge in that tremendous assize, if I shall then come there empty, where your Excellency shall bring after you flocks of faithful ones, whom you have now drawn to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by assiduous and continual preaching? But this, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, by the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, affords me great comfort, that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> work which I have not in myself I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in you. And, when I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with great exultation for your doings, the results of your labour become mine through charity. With regard, therefore, to the conversion of the Goths, both for your work and for our exultation, we may well exclaim with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <em>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, and on earth peace to men of goodwill</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse14">Luke 2:14</a></span>. For we, as I think, owe the more thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> for that, although we have done nothing with you, we are nevertheless partakers in your work by rejoicing with you. Further, how gladly the blessed Peter, Prince of the Apostles, has accepted the gifts of your Excellency your very life witnesses evidently to all. For it is written, <em>The vows of the righteous are his delight</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse8">Proverbs 15:8</a></span>. For indeed in the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> it is not what is given, but by whom it is given, that is regarded.</p>

<p>For hence it is that it is written, <em>The Lord had respect unto Abel and to his gifts, but unto Cain and to his gifts he had not respect</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse4">Genesis 4:4-5</a></span>. To wit, being about to say that the Lord had respect to the gifts, he was careful to premise that He had respect unto Abel. Thus it is plainly shown that the offerer was not acceptable by reason of the gifts, but the gifts were so by reason of the offerer. You show, therefore, how acceptable your offering is, seeing that, being about to give gold, you have first given gifts of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by the conversion of the nation subject to you.</p>

<p>With regard to your telling us that the abbots who were sent to us to bring your offering to the blessed Apostle Peter had been wearied by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the sea and returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> without accomplishing their voyage , your gifts were not kept back, for they reached us afterwards; but the constancy of those who had been sent has been tried, as to whether they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> desire to overcome dangers in their way, and, though fatigued in body, by no means to be wearied in mind. For adversity which comes in the way of good purposes is a trial of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not a judgment of reprobation. For who can be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> how prosperous an event it was that the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to preach, and yet in coming suffered shipwreck? But the ship of the heart stood unharmed among the billows of the sea.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I must tell you that I have been led to praise God the more for your work by what I have learned from the report of my most beloved son Probinus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>; namely that, your Excellency having issued a certain ordinance against the perfidy of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, those to whom it related attempted to bend the rectitude of your mind by offering a sum of money; which your Excellency scorned, and, seeking to satisfy the judgment of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, preferred innocence to gold. With regard to this what was done by King David recurs to my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, who, when the longed for water from the cistern of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, which was wedged in by the enemy, had been brought him by <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> soldiers, said, <em>God forbid that I should drink the blood of righteous men</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ch011.htm#verse19">1 Chronicles 11:19</a></span>. And, because he poured it out and would not drink it, it is written, <em>He offered it a libation to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</em> If, then, water was scorned by the armed king, and turned into a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we may estimate what manner of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> has been offered by the king who for His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has scorned to receive, not water, but gold. Wherefore, most excellent son, I will confidently say that you have offered as a libation to the Lord the gold which you would not have in opposition to Him. These are great things, and redound to the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>.</p>

<p>But in the midst of all these things we must guard with vigilant attention against the snares of the ancient foe, who, the greater gifts he sees among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, with the more subtle snares seeks to take them away. For <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> too do not look out for empty travellers to seize them on their road, but such as carry vessels of gold and silver. For indeed the present life is a road. And every one must needs be the more on his guard against ambushed spirits in proportion as the gifts are greater which he carries. It is the duty, then, of your Excellency, with regard to this so great gift which you have received in the conversion of the nation subject to you, to keep with all your might, first humility of heart, and secondly cleanness of body. For where it is written, <em>Every one that exalts himself shall be humbled, and he that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself shall be exalted</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse11">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse14">18:14</a></span>, it is assuredly evident that he <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> loves what is lofty who does not cut off his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the root of humility. For often the malignant spirit, in order to destroy the good that previously he had not power to oppose, comes into the mind of the worker after accomplishment of his work, and agitates it with silent thoughts of self-praise, so that the deluded mind admires itself for the great things that it has done. And, being exalted in its own sight through hidden tumour, it is deprived of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Him Who bestowed the gift. For hence it is that it is said through the voice of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that waxes <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, <em>Having trust in your beauty you played the harlot because of your renown</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse15">Ezekiel 16:15</a></span>. For indeed a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> having trust in its beauty is its presuming within itself on its righteous doings. And it plays the harlot because of its renown, when in what it has done aright it desires not the praise of its Maker to be spread abroad, but seeks the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of its own <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. Hence again it is written through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <em>In that you are more beautiful, go down</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze032.htm#verse19">Ezekiel 32:19</a></span>. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> goes down because of being more beautiful when, owing to the comeliness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby it ought to have been exalted before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it falls from His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through elation. What then is to be done in this case but that, when the malignant spirit employs the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that we have done to exalt the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, we should ever recall to memory our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, to the end that we may acknowledge that what we have done sinfully is our own, but that it is of the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> alone when we avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Cleanness also of body is to be guarded in our strivings after well-doing, since, according to the voice of the apostolic preacher, <em>The temple of God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, which temple you are</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 3:17</a></span>. And again he says, <em>For this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even your sanctification</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse3">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a></span>. As to which sanctification, what he means by it he shows by straightway adding, <em>That you should abstain from fornication, that every one of you should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to possess his vessel in sanctification and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, not in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of concupiscence.</em></p>

<p>The very government also of your kingdom in relation to your subjects ought to be tempered with moderation, lest power steal upon your mind. For a kingdom is ruled well when the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of reigning does not dominate the disposition. Care also is to be taken that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> creep not in, lest whatever is lawful to be done be done too hastily. For <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, even when it prosecutes the faults of delinquents, ought not to go before the mind as a mistress, but attend as a handmaid behind the back of reason, that it may come to the front when bidden. For, if once it begins to have possession of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it accounts as just what it does cruelly. For hence it is written, <em>The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of man works not the righteousness of God</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse20">James 1:20</a></span>. Hence again it is said, <em>Let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a></em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ib. 19). However I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that under the guidance of God you observe all these things. Still, now that an opportunity of admonition has arisen, I join myself furtively to your good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, so that what you do though not admonished you may not do alone, having an admonisher to boot. Now may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> protect you in all your doings by the stretching out of His heavenly arm, and grant you prosperity in the present life, and after a course of many years <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> joys.</p>

<p>We have sent you a small key from the most sacred body of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> to convey his blessing, containing iron from his chains, that what had bound his neck for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> may loose yours from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. We have given also to the bearer of these presents, to be offered to you, a cross in which there is some of the wood of the Lord's cross, and hairs of the blessed John the Baptist, from which you may ever have the succour of our Saviour through the intercession of His forerunner.</p>

<p>Moreover we have sent to our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Leander a <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from the See of the blessed Apostle Peter, which we owe both to ancient custom, and to your character, and to his goodness and gravity .</p>

<p>A long time ago, when a certain Neapolitan youth came hither, your to me most sweet Excellency had thought fit to charge me to write to the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor to the end that he might search in the record office for the treaties that had formerly been concluded with the prince Justinian of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory as to the claims of your kingdom, so as to gather from them what he should observe with regard to you. But there were two things seriously in the way of my doing this. One was that the record-office in the time of the aforesaid prince Justinian of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory had been so burnt by a fire which had crept in suddenly that hardly any paper of his times remained. The other was that, as no one need be told, you ought to look in your own archives for the documents that are against you, and produce these instead of my doing so. Wherefore I exhort your Excellency to arrange matters suitably to your character, and carefully to carry out whatever makes for peace, that the times of your reign may be memorable with great praise through many courses of years. Furthermore, we have sent you another key from the most sacred body of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, which, being laid up with due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, may multiply with blessing whatever it may find you enjoying.</p>
