<h1>Book IX, Letter 123</h1>

<p> <em>To Venantius and Italica</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to the lord Venantius, Patrician, and Italica his wife.</p>

<p>I have taken care, with due affection, to enquire of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have come from <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> about your Excellency's health. But they have given me a sad report of the frequency of your ailments. Now, when I say this, neither do I find anything to tell you about myself, except that, for my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, lo it is now eleven months since it has been a very rare case with me if I have been able now and then to rise from my bed. For I am afflicted by so great sufferings from gout, and so great from troubles, that my life is to me most grievous pain. For every day I faint under my sufferings, and sigh in expectation of the relief of death. Indeed among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of this city there has been such an invasion of feverous sicknesses that hardly any freeman, hardly any slave, remains fit for any office or ministry. Moreover, from the neighbouring cities we have news daily of havocs and of mortality. Then, how Africa is being wasted by mortality and sickness I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more accurately than we do, insomuch as you are nearer to it. But of the East those who come from thence report still more grievous desolations. In the midst of all these things, therefore, since you perceive that there is a general smiting as the end of the world draws near, you ought not to be too much afflicted for your own troubles. But, as becomes wise nobles, bring back your whole heart to the care of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the strict judgment all the more as it is so much nearer at hand. Devote yourselves to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, of which it is written that <em>It has promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 4:8</a></span>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> is powerful both to preserve the life of your Excellency for a long time here, and to bring you after many courses of years to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> joys. I beg my most sweet daughters, the lady Barbara and the lady Antonina, to be greeted in my name; whom I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may protect, and grant them to be prospered in all things.</p>
