<h1>Book IX, Letter 125</h1>

<p> <em>To Maximus, Bishop of Salona</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Maximus, etc.</p>

<p>Having received the letters of our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Marinianus, and Castorius, our <em>chartularius</em>, having also returned, we learn that your Fraternity have made most full satisfaction with regard to the matters about which there had been uncertainty; and we return great thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that from our inmost heart all rancour of sinister suspicion has been eradicated. On this account I have been desirous of dismissing with the utmost speed our common son, your <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Stephen. But the frequent pains of my sicknesses have compelled me to retain him with me for a few days. As soon, however, as I have begun to be even slightly better, I have provided for sending him immediately back to you with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</p>

<p>Accordingly we send to you, according to custom, the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> for the sacred solemnities of mass; the meaning of which we desire you in all respects to vindicate. For the dignity of this vestment is humility and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Let, then, your Fraternity make haste with all your heart to show yourself <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in prosperity, and in adversity, if ever it should ensue; upright in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; friendly to the good, and opposed to the froward; never discountenancing any one who speaks for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; instant in works of mercy according to your means, and yet beyond your means desiring to be instant; sympathizing with the weak; rejoicing with men of good will; regarding the woes of others as your own; exulting for the joys of others as if for your own; in correcting <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> severe, in cherishing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, soothing the minds of hearers; in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, retaining judgment without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but in calmness not relinquishing the censorship of your severity. This, dearest brother, is the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> which you will receive, which if you act up to, you will have inwardly what you are seen to have received outwardly.</p>

<p>Furthermore I commend in all respects to your Fraternity our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Sabinianus ; and if there be any matters of dispute between you, let them meanwhile be laid aside. Let charity remain fixed between you, that so, in case of contention ever arising about external things, they may be examined without charity deserting the heart. We commend also our common son Honoratus: concerning whom if it is the case, as we have learned through Castorius our <em>chartularius</em>; that through him three previous archdeacons have been compelled to observe the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> custom by retiring at the expiration of five years, we desire indeed that he may experience the charity of your Holiness. For a judgment ought not to be solicited in a case which he himself has judged. If, however, it is not so, then, all swelling of heart being repressed, and all grudge set aside, he ought to be received, and by no means removed from the place which he now occupies. Messianus also, the <em><a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a></em> who had taken refuge with us, we have confidently committed to the charge of our common son Stephen the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, being assured that in the case of one whom we ourselves send to your Fraternity, you will not show any grudge, but lend the countenance of your authority. May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> keep you in His protection, and grant us so to act that after the billows of this temporal state we may be able to attain with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>
