<h1>Book IX, Letter 24</h1>

<p> <em>To Romanus, Guardian (Defensorem).</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Romanus, etc.</p>

<p>Our son Theodosius, abbot of the Monastery founded by the late Patrician Liberius in Campania, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have intimated to us that the late illustrious lady Rustica about one and twenty years ago, in the will that she made, appointed in the first place Felix, her husband, to be her heir, and delegated to him the foundation of a Monastery in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>; but on this condition&mdash;that if he should not within the space of one year pay all the legacies bequeathed to her freedmen, or establish the aforesaid Monastery as she desired, then the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Roman Church should have undisputed claim to the portion which she was understood to have in the farm of Cumas, and that it should lend aid for paying the above legacies, and for the construction of the said <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Hence, seeing that, as is said, the bequeathed property has not so far been made over in full to this same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and some part of the possession is up to this time detained by her heirs, let your Experience thoroughly enquire into and examine the case. And in the first place indeed, if under the conditions of the will any heirship comes in wherein our Church may have a plea, we desire you to investigate and clearly ascertain it, and act for the advantage of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, as the order of the business may require; and then to be instantly solicitous for the due establishment of that cell, and the recovery of the bequeathed property, to the end that the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> desire of the testatrix may be fulfilled in both respects, and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> detainers of the property may learn from just loss the guilt of their undue retention. With all vivacity, then, we desire you both to enquire into this case and, with the help of the Lord, to bring it to an issue, that the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> devotion of the ordainer may at length take effect. But we desire you also, as far as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> allows, to succour this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in all ways, that lay <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who ought to have rendered the succour of their assistance may not, as is asserted, have power of doing hurt in the name of the founder.</p>
