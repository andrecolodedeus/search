<h1>Book IX, Letter 49</h1>

<p> <em>To Anastasius, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a></em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Anastasius, etc.</p>

<p>I received the letters of your Fraternity, rightly holding fast the profession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and I returned great thanks to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, when the shepherds of His flock are changed, still, even after such change, guards the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which He once delivered to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers. Now the excellent preacher says, <em>Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 3:2</a></span>. Whosoever, then, with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his neighbour, holds firmly the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he has laid for himself the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and man, as a foundation. It is to be hoped therefore that, where Christ is the foundation, the edifice also of good works may follow. The Truth also in person says, <em>He that enters not by the door into the sheep-fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber; but he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse1">John 10:1</a></span>. And a little after He adds, <em>I am the door</em>. He, then, enters into the sheep-fold through the door who enters through Christ. And he enters through Christ who thinks and preaches what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> concerning the same Creator and Redeemer of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and holds fast what he preaches; who takes upon him the topmost place of rule for the office of carrying a burden, not for the desire of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of transitory dignity. He also watches wisely over the sheep-fold of which he has taken charge, lest either perverse men tear the sheep of God by speaking froward things, or malignant spirits ravage them by persuading to vicious delights.</p>

<p>Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we remember how the blessed Jacob, who had served long for his wives, said, <em>This twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your she goats have not been barren. The rams of your flock have I not eaten, nor shown unto you that which had been seized by a beast. I made good every loss; whatever had been lost by theft, from me did you require it. By day and night I was consumed by drought and frost; sleep fled from my eyes</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen031.htm#verse38">Genesis 31:38</a></span>. If, then, he who feeds the sheep of Laban labours and watches thus, on what labour, on what watches, should he be intent who feeds the sheep of God? But in all this let Him instruct us who for our sake became a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who vouchsafed to become what he had made. May He pour both into my weakness and into your charity the spirit of His own <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and in all carefulness and watchfulness of circumspection open the eye of our heart.</p>

<p>But for men of a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> being advanced to sacred orders thanks are to be paid without cease to the same Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> ever made for the life of our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> lord the Emperor, and for his most tranquil spouse, and their most gentle offspring, in whose times the mouths of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are silent; since, though their hearts seethe with the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of perverse thought, yet in the time of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Emperor they presume not to speak out the bad things which they think.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in speaking of your maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> councils, your Fraternity declares that you maintain the first <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Ephesine synod. But, seeing that from the account given in an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> document which has been sent me from the royal city, I have found that, according to it, certain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> positions had been censured along with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> ones, because some suppose that to have been the first Ephesine synod which was got together at some time or other by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in the same city, it is altogether necessary that your Charity should apply to the Churches of Alexandria and <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> for the acts of this synod, and find how the matter really stands. Or, if you please, we will send you hence what we have here, preserved from of old in our archives. For that synod which was held under pretence of being the first Ephesine asserts that certain positions submitted to it were approved, which are the declared tenets of C&oelig;lestius and Pelagius. And, C&oelig;lestius and Pelagius having been condemned in that synod, how could those positions be approved, the authors of which were condemned ?</p>

<p>Further, since it has come to our ears that in the Churches of the East no one attains to a sacred order except by giving of <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>, if your Fraternity finds it to be so, offer your first oblation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> by restraining in the Churches subject to you the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. For, to pass over other considerations, what manner of men can they be in sacred orders who are raised to them not by merit, but by <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>? May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> guard your Love with heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and grant to you to carry with you to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> joys multiplied fruit and overflowing measure from those who are committed to your charge.</p>
