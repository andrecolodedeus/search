<h1>Book IX, Letter 55</h1>

<p> <em>To Fantinus, Guardian (Defensorem), of Panormus (Palermo).</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Fantinus, etc.</p>

<p>A little time ago we wrote to Victor, our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that&mdash; inasmuch as certain of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have complained in a petition presented to us that <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> with their guest-chambers, situated in the city of Panormus, had by him been unreasonably taken possession of&mdash; he should keep aloof from their congregation until it could be ascertained whether this thing had been <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> done, lest perchance injury should appear to have been alleged by them of their own mere will. And indeed, having regard to his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, we could not easily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that our aforesaid brother had done anything unsuitably. But, since we find from the report of Salarius, our notary, who was afterwards there, that there had been no reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for taking possession of those <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, and that they had been unadvisedly and rashly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, we therefore enjoin your Experience, since what has been once <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> cannot any more be restored to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that it be your care to see that our aforesaid brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> pay the price at which our sons, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Venantius the Patrician, and Urbicus the Abbot, may value the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> themselves with the guest-chambers that are under them or annexed to their walls, and the gardens thereto adjoining; that so what he has caused to be taken possession of may belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and they may in no way be oppressed, or suffer any <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Moreover, let books or ornaments that have been abstracted be in like manner sought for. And, if any have been manifestly taken away, we desire them also to be restored without any ambiguity. For, as there ought to be no licence for them, as we have ourselves already written, to do anything in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> beyond what is decreed by law, so neither damage nor any cost ought to be brought upon them contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and equity.</p>
