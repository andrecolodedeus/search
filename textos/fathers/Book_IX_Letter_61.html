<h1>Book IX, Letter 61</h1>

<p>Here begins the epistle of Rechared, King of the Goths, addressed to the blessed Gregory, Bishop of Rome .</p>

<p>Rechared to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> lord and most blessed pope, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Gregory.</p>

<p>At the time when the Lord in His compassion caused us to be dissociated from the impious <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gathered us into her bosom ameliorated in the path of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it was then the desire of our mind to seek with delight and with the whole bent of our mind so very reverend a man; you who art powerful above all other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, that he might commend in all ways a thing so worthy and acceptable to God for us men. But, whereas we are engaged in many cares of government, being occupied by various occasions, three years passed without the desire of our mind being satisfied. And after this we chose, for the purpose of sending them to you, some abbots of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, who should proceed to your presence, and offer gifts sent by us to Saint Peter, and bring us word more distinctly of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> reverence's health. But, as they hastened on their way, and were almost in sight of the shores of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, it befell them that they struck on certain rocks near Marseilles, and were scarcely able to deliver their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. And now we have entreated a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> whom your Glory had sent as far as the city of Malaca (<em>civitatem Malicitanam</em>) to come into our sight. But he, detained by bodily infirmity, has in no wise been able to reach the soil of our kingdom. But, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> most certainly that he was sent by your Holiness, we have sent a golden cup ornamented on the outside with gems for your Holiness (as I trust you will vouchsafe to do) to offer as worthy of the apostle who shines the first in dignity. For I also beg your Highness, when an opportunity is found, to seek us out by your sacred golden letters. For how much I <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is not hidden, the Lord inspiring you, from the fecundity of your own breast. It is sometimes the case that those whom tracts of land or sea divide the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ glues together as if visibly. For to those who do not see you at all in person fame discloses your goodness.</p>

<p>Further, I commend with all veneration to your Holiness in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Leander, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the church of Hispalis, since through him your benevolence has been made clearly manifest to us; and when we talk of your life with this same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, we reckon ourselves as your inferiors in regard to your good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. I am delighted to hear of your health, most reverend and most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man; and I beg of your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> that you would commend frequently in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to our common Lord us and our people, who are ruled after God under our government, and have been acquired by Christ in your times; that hereby <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> charity to God-ward may establish in well-being those whom the breadth of the world separates.</p>
