<h1>Book IX, Letter 67</h1>

<p> <em>To Constantius, Bishop of Milan</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Constantius, etc.</p>

<p>Maximus, the prevaricator of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Salona, after he had failed to obtain anything through the greater powers of the world, has betaken himself to the lesser ones; and by a superfluity of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and by attestation to his good works he strives to prevail with us. This being so, I have thought it would be inhuman in me, if he who says that he fears me much were quite unable to find me in some degree more indulgent. And I have therefore decided that our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Marinianus should take cognizance of his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in the city of Ravenna. If, however, by any chance his person is suspected, we desire that your Fraternity also, if it is not too laborious for you, should take the trouble of repairing to the same city, and sit together with our aforesaid brother in the same trial. Whatever, then, may seem good to each of your Holinesses, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it will seem good to me; and your judgment I accept as my own; and what things you both think should be remitted, be assured that I remit; taking, however, careful heed that we may not appear to be either sinfully remiss or austere to the injury of Holy Church. We have enjoined the execution of this matter on the Chartulary Castorius, that he may fully report to us all that has been done.</p>
