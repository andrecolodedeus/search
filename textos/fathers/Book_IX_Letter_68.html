<h1>Book IX, Letter 68</h1>

<p> <em>To Eusebius of Thessalonica.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Eusebius of Thessalonica, Urbicus of Dyrrachium, Andrew of Nicopolis, John of Corinth, John of Prima Justiniana, John of Crete, John of Larissa and Scodra, and many other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</p>

<p>We are constrained by the care of government which we have undertaken to extend vigilantly the solicitude of our office, and to instruct the minds of our brethren by addresses of admonition, that no wrongful presumption may avail to deceive the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, nor any dissimulation to excuse those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> then to your Fraternity that John, formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Constantinople, against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, against the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to the contempt and injury of all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, exceeded the bounds of modesty and of his own measure, and unlawfully usurped in synod the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and pestiferous title of &oelig;cumenical, that is to say, universal. When our predecessor Pelagius of blessed memory became aware of this, he annulled by a fully valid censure all the proceedings of that same synod, except what had therein been done in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Gregory, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, of venerable memory; taking him to task with most severe rebuke, and warning him to abstain from that new and temerarious name of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>; even so as to forbid his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to go in procession  with him, unless he should amend so great a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And we, adhering in all respects to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of his rectitude, observe his ordinances, under the protection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, irrefragably, since it is fitting that he should walk without stumbling along the straight way of his predecessor, whom the tribunal of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Judge awaits for rendering an account of the same place of government. In which matter, lest we should seem to omit anything that pertains to the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we once and again addressed the same most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> John by letter, bidding him relinquish that name of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and incline the elation of his heart to the humility which our Master and Lord has taught us. And having found that he paid no regard, we have not desisted, in our desire of concord, from addressing the like admonitions to our most blessed brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Cyriacus, his successor. But since it is the case, as we see, now that the end of this world is near at hand, that the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> has already appeared in his harbingers, so as to have as his precursors, through this title of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, the very <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who ought to have opposed him by living well and humbly, I exhort and entreat that not one of you ever accept this name, that not one consent to it, that not one write it, that not one admit it wherever it may have been written, or add his subscription to it; but, as becomes ministers of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that each keep himself from this kind of poisoned infection, and give no place to the cunning lier-in-wait, since this thing is being done to the injury and rendering asunder of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and, as we have said, to the contemning of all of you. For if one, as he supposes, is universal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, it remains that you are not <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that your Fraternity has been convened to Constantinople. And although our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor allows nothing unlawful to be done there, yet, lest perverse men, taking occasion of your assembly, should seek opportunity of cajoling you in favouring this name of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, or should think of holding a synod about some other matter, with the view of introducing it therein by cunning contrivances,&mdash; though without the authority and consent of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> nothing that might be passed would have any force, nevertheless, before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> I conjure and warn you, that the assent of none of you be obtained by any blandishments, any <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>, any threats whatever; but, having regard to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> judgment, acquit yourselves salubriously and unanimously in opposition to wrongful aims; and, supported by pastoral constancy and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> authority, keep out the robber and the wolf that would rush in, and give no way to him that rages for the tearing of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> asunder; nor allow, through any cajolery, a synod to be held on this subject, which indeed would not be a legitimate one, nor to be called a synod. We also at the same time admonish you, that if haply nothing should be done with mention of this preposterous name, but a synod be by any chance assembled on another matter, you be in all respects cautious, circumspect, watchful, and careful, lest anything should therein be decreed against any place or person prejudicially, or unlawfully, or in opposition to the canons. But, if any question arises to be treated with advantage, let the question in hand take such a form that it may not upset any ancient ordinances. Wherefore we once more admonish you before God and His Saints, that you observe all these things with the utmost attention, and with the entire bent of your minds. For if any one, as we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> will be the case, should disregard in any part this present writing, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he is segregated from the peace of the blessed Peter, the Prince of the Apostles. Let, then, your Fraternity so act that when the Shepherd of shepherds comes in judgment, you may not be found guilty with respect to the place of government which you have received.</p>
