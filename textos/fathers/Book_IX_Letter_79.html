<h1>Book IX, Letter 79</h1>

<p> <em>To Marinianus, Bishop of Ravenna</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Marinianus, etc.</p>

<p>What is to be done in the case of Maximus you have learned from the letters which we have before sent to you. But, since we have ascertained from the report of our Chartulary Castorius, the bearer of these presents, what is the wish, or rather the request, of your Fraternity in this matter, therefore if the said Maximus, in the presence of you and our aforesaid Chartulary, shall purge himself on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> from simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and with respect to other charges shall, before the body of Saint <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, as we have written, reply only, when interrogated, that he is guiltless, we commit his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to the judgment of your Fraternity, with regard to his having presumed to celebrate the solemnities of mass while <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, as to what penance such fault shall be purged by. And so, whatever according to God seems good to you, do you settle without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and entertain no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> with regard to us. For whatsoever may be ordained by you concerning this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we both thankfully accept and willingly allow. Yet we exhort you that you should be careful, and so temper what you provide for being done as both to deal kindly with him, if so it shall seem fit, and by a suitable arrangement to observe, as you ought, the genius of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> vigour. We have instructed the above-named bearer, while present with us, how he is to act with you; and, having learned all thoroughly from him, do you so acquit yourselves in all respects that in your anxious care we may feel that our presence has been with you.</p>
