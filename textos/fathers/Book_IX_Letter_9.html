<h1>Book IX, Letter 9</h1>

<p> <em>To Callinicus, Exarch of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a></em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Callinicus, etc.</p>

<p>In the midst of what you have announced to me of your victories over the Sclaves, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have been refreshed with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> that the bearers of these presents, hastening to be joined to the unity of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church from the island of Capritana , have been sent by your Excellency to the blessed Peter, Prince of the Apostles. For hereby you will the more prevail over your enemies, if you recall under the yoke of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lord those whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be the enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and you will prosecute your causes among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with all the more effect as with sincere and devout mind you maintain the causes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Now as to your having desired that a copy should be shown me of the order  that has been sent to you for the defence of the schismatic, your to me most sweet Excellency ought to have considered carefully how that, although that order has been elicited, you are still not therein enjoined to repel those who come to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but only, at this unsettled time, not to compel those who are unwilling to come. Whence it is necessary for you with all speed to inform our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperors of these things, to the end that they may be aware how that in their times, through the succour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> and your exertions, schismatics are hastening to return of their own accord. What I have decided as to the ordering of things in the island of Caritana, your Excellency will learn through our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Marinianus . But I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this has caused me no slight distress; that your Majordomo, who took charge of the petition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who was wishing to return, declared that he had lost it, and that afterwards he was got hold of by the adversaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: which proceeding, in my opinion, was due not to his neglect but to his venality. Wherefore I wonder that your Excellency has not in any way visited his fault in him. And yet I soon blamed myself for wondering at this, for where the lord Justinus gives advice, there <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot be arraigned.</p>

<p>Moreover you tell us that you wish to keep the anniversary of Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. And we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> to protect you with His mercy, and grant you a fulfilment of your desires. But I beg that the aforesaid most eloquent man may come with you, or that, if he does not come, he may retire from attendance on you. Or certainly, if your Excellency should be unable to come owing to business that may arise, let him either communicate with the unity of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, or I beg that he may not be a sharer of your counsels. For I hear of him as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, were he not in most mischievous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. As to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Maximus, inasmuch as we can no longer stand against the importunity of your Sweetness, you will learn from Castorius, the notary, what we have determined.</p>
