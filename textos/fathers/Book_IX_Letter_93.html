<h1>Book IX, Letter 93</h1>

<p> <em>To Gulfaris, Magister Militum</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Gulfaris, etc.</p>

<p>The bearers of these presents, who come to us from the Istrian parts, have reported such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of your Glory as to inflame us ardently to return you thanks. For we learn that, among the cares of the government of those parts which has been committed to you, you are especially anxious to win <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and that you so take pains to recall the hearts of wanderers to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that, as far as your desire goes, you would have no one there separated from the Apostolic Church; and that so great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, inflames you that you long with all your heart to restore the sheepfold of him to whom the keys were delivered by the Lord the Creator of all. Have, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> son, from such and so great a work, a confident anticipation of divine retribution, wherein not only our admonition but also the words of the apostle confirm you, since he who shall have caused a sinner to be converted from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his way shall save his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from death, and cover a multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jam005.htm">James 5</a></span>. For, however great be temporal affluence, or at any rate prosperity, it has its end&mdash;the limit of death. But this pursuit of winning <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which you have taken up, retains the certainty of its hope fixed; to wit, the retribution of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Wherefore, greeting you with fatherly affection, we exhort your Glory that you the more earnestly give effect to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the unity of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which the Author of unity Himself has given you; and that, recalling whomsoever you can from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of their <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> into the bosom of Mother Church, you cherish them with continual admonition. And accomplish this also&mdash;so to protect with the succour of your defence those whom the Lord through you may grant to be restored to His fold that there may be no quarter to which those who are still in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> may be able to resort for the accusation of such as return to sound counsels. For, while you uphold the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of God on earth, He Himself will prosperously direct your actions here with the aid of His protection, and there will remain for you, in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life which you long for, retribution for your so great well-doing.</p>
