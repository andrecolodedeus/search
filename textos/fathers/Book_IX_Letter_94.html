<h1>Book IX, Letter 94</h1>

<p> <em>To Romanus the Guardian (Defensorem).</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Romanus, etc.</p>

<p>The bearers of these presents, who came hither from the parts of Istria to find their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who is now living in the parts of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, have asked us to speed them in their way, and we have arranged for their journey hence. Let, then, your Experience receive them, and arrange for their reaching their said <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as soon as possible; lest, as they allege may be the case, others of the schismatics in those parts should be beforehand to persuade them. For, so far as they indicate, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself has a desire to come to us in behalf of the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Assistance therefore should be given them, that, with the help of the Lord, they may accomplish the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things they desire. But let your Experience, in person if he is near at hand or otherwise by letter, exhort this same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to lose no time in hastening, with the Lord's good favour, to the threshold of the Apostles, being assured that he will be received by us with all affection. We also desire you to pay him the cost of his journey to enable him to come to us. But, if he finds coming here burdensome, and arranges to live in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and consents, with his security given, to remain in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among the perverters of Scripture, this also do not delay to inform us of, that we may arrange, with the help of the Lord, how provision may be made for his expenses there. But lend also your concurrence and succour for the bearers of these letters to come to their said <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, so that after leaving us they may experience no less attention.</p>
