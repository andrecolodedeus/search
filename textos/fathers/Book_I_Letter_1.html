<h1>Book I, Letter 1</h1>

<p> <em>To all the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.</em></p>

<p>Gregory, servant of the servants of God , to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> constituted throughout <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.</p>

<p>We have plainly perceived it to be very necessary that, even as our predecessors thought fit to do, we should commit all things to one and the same person; and that, where we cannot be present ourselves, our authority should be represented through him to whom we send our instructions. Wherefore, with the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we have appointed Peter, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> of our See, our delegate in the province of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Nor can we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the conduct of him to whom, with the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have committed the charge of the whole patrimony of our church.</p>

<p>This also we have plainly perceived to be a thing that ought to be done; that once in the year your whole fraternity should assemble, at Syracuse or Catana, receiving, as we have charged him, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to you; to the end that, together with the aforesaid Peter, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> of our See, you may settle with due discretion whatever things pertain to the advantage of the churches of the province, or to the relief of the necessities of the poor and oppressed, or to the admonition of all, and the correction of those whose transgressions may perhaps be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. From which council far be animosities, which are the nutriment of crimes, and may inward grudges die away, and that discord of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which is beyond measure execrable. Let concord well-pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and charity, approve you as His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Conduct all things, therefore, with such deliberation and calmness that yours may most worthily be called an Episcopal Council.</p>
