<h1>Book I, Letter 2</h1>

<p> <em>To Justinus, Pr&aelig;tor of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Justinus, Pr&aelig;tor of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.</p>

<p>What my tongue speaks my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> approves; since even before you had become engaged in the employments of any office of dignity, I have greatly loved and greatly respected you. For the very modesty of your deportment made certain incipient claims on affection even from one who had been loth. And, when I heard that you had come to administer the pr&aelig;torship of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, I greatly rejoiced. But, since I have discovered that a certain ill-feeling is creeping in between you and the ecclesiastics, I have been exceedingly distressed. But now that you are occupied with the charge of civil administration, and I with the care of this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government, we can properly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another in particular so far as we do no harm to the general community. Wherefore I beseech you by Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before Whose tremendous judgment we must give account of our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, that your Glory have always the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of Him before your eyes, and never allow anything to come in whereby even slight dissension may arise between us. Let no gains draw you aside to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; let not either the threats or the favours of any one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to deviate from the path of rectitude. See how short life is: think, you that exercise judicial authority, before what judge you must at some time go. It is therefore to be diligently considered that we shall leave all gains behind us here, and that of harmful gains we shall carry with us to the judgment the pleas only that are against us for them. Those advantages, then, are to be sought by us which death may in no wise take away, but which the end of the present life may show to be such as will endure for ever.</p>

<p>As to what you write concerning the grain, the magnificent Citonatus asserts very differently that no more has been transmitted than what was supplied for replenishing the public granary in satisfaction of what was due for the past indiction. Give attention to this matter, since, if what is transmitted be at all defective, it will be the death not of any one single person only, but of the whole people together. </p>

<p>Now for the management of the patrimony of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> I have sent, as I think under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, such a man as you will be in entire accord with, if you are a lover of what is right, as I have found you to be. Moreover, as to your desire that I should remember you kindly, I confess the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when I say that, unless any <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> should creep in from the snares of the ancient foe, I have learned your Glory's modesty to be such that I shall not blush to be your friend.</p>
