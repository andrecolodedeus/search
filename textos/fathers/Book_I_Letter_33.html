<h1>Book I, Letter 33</h1>

<p> <em>To Romanus, Patrician, and Exarch of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Romanus, etc.</p>

<p>Even though there were no immediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for writing to your Excellency, yet we ought to show solicitude for your health and safety so as to learn through frequent intercommunication what we desire to hear about you. Besides, it has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that Blandus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Hortanum , has been detained now for a long time by your Excellency in the city of Ravenna. And the result is that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> decays, being without a ruler, and the people as being without a shepherd; and infants there, for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, die without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.  And again, since we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that your Excellency has detained him except on the ground of some probable transgression, it is proper that a synod should be held to bring to light any crime that is charged against him. And, if such fault is found in him as to lead to his degradation from the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, it is necessary that we should look out for another to be ordained, lest the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> should remain untended, and destitute in what the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> does not allow it to be without. But, if your Excellency should perceive that the case is otherwise with him than it is said to be, allow him, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, to return to his church, that he may fulfil his duty to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> committed to his charge.</p>

<p>The month of March; the ninth Indiction.</p>
