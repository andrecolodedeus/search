<h1>Book I, Letter 36</h1>

<p> <em>To Peter the Subdeacon.</em></p>

<p>Gregory, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, servant of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Peter the Subdeacon.</p>

<p>The code of instructions which I gave you on your going to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> must be diligently perused, so that the greatest care may be taken concerning <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, lest they mix themselves up in secular causes, except so far as the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of defending the poor compels them. But what is inserted in the same code concerning <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> ought, I think, in no respect to be varied from. But let your Experience observe these things with such great attention as may fulfil my desire in this regard. Further, it has come to my ears that from the times of Antoninus, the defensor, till now, during these last ten years, many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have endured certain acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> from the Roman Church, so that some publicly complain of their boundaries having been violently invaded, their slaves abstracted, and their moveables carried off by force, and not by any judicial process. In all such cases I desire your Experience to keep intent watch, and whatsoever during these last ten years may be found to have been taken away by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, or retained <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to restore it by authority of this my order to him to whom it is found to belong; lest he who has suffered <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> should be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to come to me, and undertake the labour of so long a journey, in which case it could not be ascertained here before me whether or not he spoke the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Having regard, then, to the majesty of the Judge who is to come, restore all things that have been sinfully taken away, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you bring great gain to me, if you gather [heavenly] reward rather than riches. But we have ascertained that what the greater part complain of is the loss of their slaves, saying that, if any man's bondman, perhaps running away from his master, has declared himself to belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the rectors  of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have at once kept him as a bondman belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, without any trial of the case, but supporting with a high hand the word of the bondman. This displeases me as much as it is abhorrent from the judgment of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Wherefore I desire your Experience to correct without delay whatever may be found to have been so done: and it is also fit that any such slaves as are now kept in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> possession, as they were taken away without trial, should be restored before trial; so that, if <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church has any legitimate claim to them, their possessors may then be dispossessed by regular process of law. Correct all these things irretractably, since you will be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a soldier of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> if in his causes you keep guard over the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, even without his receiving anything. But, if you see anything that may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be claimed as belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, beware lest you ever try to assert such claim by force; especially as I have established a decree under pain of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, that <em>tituli</em> may not ever be put by our Church on any urban or rural farm ; but whatever may in reason be claimed for the poor ought also to be defended by reason; lest, a good thing being done in a manner that is not good, we be convicted of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> even in what we <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> seek. Moreover, I pray you, let noble <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> [Pr&aelig;tor]  <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you for your humility, not dread you for your <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. And yet, if by any chance you know them to be doing any <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to the indigent, turn your humility at once into exaltation, so as to be always submissive to them when they do well, and opposed to them when they do ill. But so behave that neither your humility be remiss nor your authority stiff, to the end that uprightness season humility, and humility render your very uprightness gentle. Further, since it has been customary for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to assemble here for the anniversary  of the pontiff, forbid their coming for the day of my ordination, since foolish and vain superfluity delights me not. But if they must needs assemble, let them come for the anniversary  of Peter, the prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, to render thanks to him by whose bounty they are pastors. Farewell. Given this XVII day of the Kalends of April, in the ninth year of the Emperor Mauricius.</p>
