<h1>Book I, Letter 42</h1>

<p> <em>To Anthemius, Subdeacon</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Anthemius, etc.</p>

<p>John, our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in a schedule sent to us by his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> Justus, has among many other things intimated to us as follows: that some <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the diocese of Surrentum  transmigrate from <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> as they please, and depart from the rule of their own abbot out of desire for a worldly life; nay even (what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be unlawful) that they aim severally at having property of their own. Wherefore we command your Experience by this present order, that no <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> be henceforth allowed to migrate from <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and that you permit not any one of them to have anything of his own. But, if any one whatever should so presume, let him be sent back with adequate constraint to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in which he lived at first, to be under the rule of his own abbot from which he had escaped; lest, if we allow so great an iniquity to take its course uncorrected, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those that are lost be required from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of their superiors. Further, if any of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should chance to become <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, let it not be lawful for them to return anew to the same church in which they had formerly served, or to any other; unless one should be a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of such a life that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> under whom he had formerly served should think him worthy of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, so that he may be chosen by him, and by him ordained to such place as he may think fit. And since we have learned that some among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> have plunged into such great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> as publicly to take to themselves wives, do thou seek them out with all vigilance, and, when found, send them back with due constraint to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of which they had been <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. But neglect not to deal also with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who profess monasticism, as we have said above. For so you will be pleasing in the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and be found partaker of a full reward.</p>
