<h1>Book I, Letter 43</h1>

<p> <em>To Leander Bishop of Hispalis (Seville)</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Leander, etc.</p>

<p>I should have wished to reply to your letters with full application of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, were I not so worn by the labour of my pastoral charge as to be more inclined to weep than to say anything. And this your Reverence will take care to understand and allow for in the very text of my letters, when I speak negligently to one whom I exceedingly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For, indeed, I am in this place tossed by such billows of this world that I am in no wise able to steer into port the old and rotten ship of which, in the hidden dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I have assumed the guidance. Now in front the billows rush in, now at the side heaps of foamy sea swell up, now from behind the storm follows on. And, disquieted in the midst of all this, I am compelled sometimes to steer in the very face of the opposing waters; sometimes, turning the ship aside, to avoid the threats of the billows slantwise. I groan, because I feel that through my negligence the bilgewater of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> increases, and, as the storm meets the vessel violently, the rotten planks already sound of shipwreck. With tears I remember how I have lost the placid shore of my rest, and with sighs I behold the land which still, with the winds of affairs blowing against me, I cannot reach. If, then, you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me, dearest brother, stretch out to me in the midst of these billows the hand of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; that from helping me in my labours you may, in very return for the benefit, be the stronger in your own.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, at all fully express in words my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> on having learned that our common son, the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> King Rechared, has been converted with most entire devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.  In describing his character to me in your letters you have made me <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him, though I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him not. But, since you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the wiles of the ancient foe, how against conquerors he prepares all the fiercer <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, let your Holiness keep watch the more warily over him, that he may accomplish what he has well begun, nor lift himself up for good works accomplished; that he may keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he has come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by the merits also of his life, and show by his works that he is a citizen of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom, to the end that after a course of many years he may pass from kingdom to kingdom.</p>

<p>But with respect to trine immersion in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> answer can be given than what you have yourself felt to be right; namely that, where there is one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a diversity of usage does no harm to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church. Now we, in immersing thrice, signify the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the three days' sepulture; so that, when the infant is a third time lifted out of the water, the resurrection after a space of three days may be expressed. Or, if any one should perhaps think that this is done out of veneration for the supreme Trinity, neither so is there any objection to immersing the person to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the water once, since, there being one substance in three subsistences, it cannot be in any way reprehensible to immerse the infant in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> either thrice or once, seeing that by three immersions the Trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and in one the singleness of the Divinity may be denoted. But, inasmuch as up to this time it has been the custom of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to immerse infants in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> thrice, I am of opinion that this ought not to be done among you; lest, while they number the immersions, they should divide the Divinity, and while they continue to do as they have been used to do, they should boast of having got the better of our custom. Moreover, I send to your to me most sweet Fraternity the volumes of which I have appended a notice below. What I had spoken in exposition of the blessed Job, which you express in your letter your wish to have sent to you, being weak both in sense and language as I had delivered it in homilies, I have tried as I could to change into the form of a treatise, which is in course of being written out by <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>. And, were I not crippled by the haste of the bearer of these presents, I should have wished to transmit to you the whole without diminution; especially as I have written this same work for your Reverence, that I may be seen to have sweated in my labours for him whom I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> above all others. Besides, if you find time allowed you from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> engagements, you already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how it is with me: even though absent in the body, I behold you always present with me; for I carry the image of your countenance stamped within the bowels of my heart. Given in the month of May.</p>
