<h1>Book I, Letter 5</h1>

<p> <em>To Theoctista, Sister of the Emperor.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Theoctista, etc.</p>

<p>With how great devotion my mind prostrates itself before your Venerableness I cannot fully express in words; nor yet do I labour to give utterance to it, since, even though I were silent, you read in your heart your own sense of my devotion. I wonder, however, that you withdrew your countenance, till of late bestowed on me, from this my recent engagement in the pastoral office; wherein, under colour of episcopacy, I have been brought back to the world; in which I am involved in such great earthly cares as I do not at all remember having been subjected to even in a lay state of life. For I have lost the deep joys of my quiet, and seem to have risen outwardly while inwardly falling down. Whence I grieve to find myself banished far from the face of my Maker. For I used to strive daily to win my way outside the world, outside the flesh; to drive all phantasms of the body from the eyes of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and to see incorporeally supernal joys; and not only with my voice but in the core of my heart I used to say, <em>My heart has said unto You, I have sought Your face, Your face, Lord, will I seek</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa026.htm#verse8">Psalm 26:8</a></span>. Moreover desiring nothing, fearing nothing, in this world, I seemed to myself to stand on a certain summit of things, so that I almost <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be fulfilled in me what I had learned of the Lord's promise through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <em>I will lift you up upon the high places of the earth</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse14">Isaiah 58:14</a></span>. For he is lifted up upon the high places of the earth who treads under foot through looking down upon them in his mind even the very things of the present world which seem lofty and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>. But, having been suddenly dashed from this summit of things by the whirlwind of this trial, I have fallen into fears and tremors, since, even though I have no fears for myself, I am greatly afraid for those who have been committed to me. On every side I am tossed by the waves of business, and sunk by storms, so that I may <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> say, <em>I have come into the depth of the sea, and the storm has overwhelmed me</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa068.htm#verse3">Psalm 68:3</a></span>.  After business I long to return to my heart; but, driven therefrom by vain tumults of thoughts, I am unable to return. From this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, then, that which is within me is made to be far from me, so that I cannot <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the prophetic voice which says, <em>Return to your heart, transgressors</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa046.htm#verse8">Isaiah 46:8</a></span>. But, pressed by foolish thoughts, I am impelled only to exclaim, <em>My heart has failed me</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa039.htm#verse13">Psalm 39:13</a></span>.  I have loved the beauty of the contemplative life as a Rachel, barren, but keen of sight and fair <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen029.htm">Genesis 29</a></span>, who, though in her quietude she is less fertile, yet sees the light more keenly. But, by what judgment I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, Leah has been coupled with me in the night, to wit, the active life; fruitful, but tender-eyed; seeing less, but bringing forth more. I have longed to sit at the feet of the Lord with Mary, to take in the words of His mouth; and lo, I am compelled to serve with Martha in external affairs, to be careful and troubled about many things <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse39">Luke 10:39</a>, <em>seq.</em></span>. A legion of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> having been, as I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, cast out of me, I wished to forget those whom I had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and to rest at the feet of the Saviour; and lo it is said to me, so as to compel me against my will, <em>Return to your house, and declare how great things the Lord has done for you</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar005.htm#verse19">Mark 5:19</a></span>. But who in the midst of so many earthly cares may be able to preach the wondrous works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it being already difficult for me even to call them to mind? For, pressed as I am in this office of dignity by a crowd of secular occupations, I see myself to be of those of whom it is written, <em>While they were being raised up you cast them down</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse18">Psalm 72:18</a></span>.  For he said not, You cast them down after they had been raised up, but while they were being raised up; because all bad men fall inwardly, while through the support of temporal dignity they seem outwardly to rise. Wherefore their very raising up is their fall, because, while they rely on false <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, they are emptied of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Hence, again, he says, <em>Consuming away as smoke shall they consume away</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse20">Psalm 36:20</a></span>.  For smoke in rising consumes away, and in extending itself vanishes. And so indeed it comes to pass when present felicity accompanies the life of a sinner, since whereby he is shown to be exalted, thereby it is brought about that he should cease to be. Hence, again, it is written, <em>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, make them like a wheel</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse14">Psalm 82:14</a></span>.  For a wheel is lifted up in its hinder parts, and in its fore parts falls. But to us the things that are behind are the goods of the present world, which we leave behind us; but the things that are before are those which are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and permanent, to which we are called, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, saying, <em>Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse13">Philippians 3:13</a></span>. The sinner, therefore, when he is advanced in the present life, is made to be as a wheel, since, while falling in the things which are before, he is lifted up in the things which are behind. For, when he enjoys in this life the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which he must leave behind, he falls from that which comes after this life. There are indeed many who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how so to control their outward advancement as by no means to fall inwardly thereby. Whence it is written, <em>God casts not away the mighty, seeing that He also Himself is mighty</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job036.htm#verse5">Job 36:5</a></span>. And it is said through Solomon,  <em>A man of understanding shall possess governments</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse5">Proverbs 1:5</a></span>. But to me these things are difficult, since they are also exceedingly burdensome; and what the mind has not received willingly it does not control fitly. Lo, our most serene Lord the Emperor has ordered an ape to be made a lion. And, indeed, in virtue of his order it can be called a lion, but a lion it cannot be made. Wherefore his Piety must needs himself take the blame of all my faults and short-comings, having committed a ministry of power to a weak agent.</p>
