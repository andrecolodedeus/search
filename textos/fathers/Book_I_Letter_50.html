<h1>Book I, Letter 50</h1>

<p> <em>To Anthemius the Subdeacon</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Anthemius, etc.</p>

<p>Even as, through the ordering of God as it has pleased Him, we have received the place of government, so ought we to be solicitous for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> committed to us. Now we find that in the Eumorphian island , in which, as is well known, there is an oratory of the blessed Peter, Prince of the Apostles, a large number of men with their wives from various patrimonies have fled to it for refuge, through stress of barbarian ferocity.  This we consider inexpedient: for, there being other places of refuge near at hand, why should <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have their abode there with <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>? Wherefore we enjoin your Experience by this present order from this time forward to allow no <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whether she be under <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> jurisdiction or any other, to take up her abode or tarry there; but let them provide for themselves a place of refuge (there being, as has been said above, so many in the neighbourhood) wherever they may choose; so that all intercourse with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> may henceforth be put an end to; lest, if we should desist from taking all the care we can, and guarding against the snares of the enemy, we henceforth (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) should be culpable in case of anything wrong taking place. Delay not, therefore, to give to the abbot Felix, the bearer of these presents, one thousand five hundred pounds of lead, which he is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be in want of in the same island, which may be charged afterwards in your accounts, when the whole quantity shall be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. So proceed, then, that you may provide yourself with some, if any can be profitably used for the buildings of the same island. Moreover, since congregations of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the islands are exposed to hardship, we forbid boys under eighteen years of age to be received into these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Or, if there are any now there, let your Experience remove them, and send them to the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. We desire you in all respects to observe this in Palmaria also and the other islands.</p>
