<h1>Book I, Letter 52</h1>

<p> <em>To Symmachus the Defensor</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Symmachus, etc.</p>

<p>My son Boniface the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> has told me that your Experience had written to say that a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> built by Labina, a religious lady, is now ready for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to be settled in it. And indeed I praised your solicitude; but we wish that some other place than that which has been assigned for the purpose should be provided; but with the condition, in view of the insecurity of the time, that one above the sea be looked out for, which is either fortified by its position, or at all events can be fortified without much labour. So may we send <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> there, to the end that the island itself, hitherto without a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, may be improved by having this way of life upon it.</p>

<p>For carrying out and providing for this business we have given directions to Horosius, the bearer of this present order, with whom your Experience must go round the shores of Corsica, and if any more suitable place in the possession of any private person should be found, we are prepared to give a suitable price, that we may be able to make some secure arrangement. We have enjoined the aforesaid Horosius to proceed to the island Gorgonia; and let your Experience accompany him, and do you so avenge the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that we have ascertained to have found entrance there that through the punishment you shall inflict the aforesaid island may remain corrected for the future also. Let the same abbot Horosius set in order the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of this island, and so hasten to return to us. Let, then, your Experience so act that in both these matters, that is, both in providing for <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Corsica, and in correcting the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Gorgonia, you may make haste to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, not our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover we desire that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who abide in Corsica shall be forbidden to have any intercourse with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, except it may be a mother, or a sister, or a wife, towards whom <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> should be observed.  But to the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> about whom your Experience has written to my son the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Boniface, give whatsoever you deem sufficient for them, since they are in grievous need; and this we will allow you afterwards in your accounts. Given in the month of July.</p>
