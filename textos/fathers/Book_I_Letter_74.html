<h1>Book I, Letter 74</h1>

<p> <em>To Gennadius, Patrician and Exarch of Africa.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Gennadius, etc.</p>

<p>As the Lord has made your Excellency to shine with the light of victories in the military <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of this life, so ought you to pose the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with all activity of mind and body, to the end that from both kinds of triumph your <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> may shine forth more and more, when in forensic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, too, you firmly resist the adversaries of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, and bravely fight <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> battles as warriors of the Lord. For it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that men <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> in religion, if they have liberty allowed them to do harm (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid), rise strenuously against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to the end that they may transfuse, if they can, the poison of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to the corrupting of the members of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> body. For we have learned that they are lifting up their necks against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Lord being opposed to them, and desire to pervert the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> profession. But let your Eminence suppress their attempts, and subdue their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> necks to the yoke of rectitude.  Moreover, order the council of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to be admonished not to appoint their primate on the ground of his standing, without regard to the merits of his life, since before God it is not the more distinguished rank, but the action of a better life, that is approved.  But let the primate himself live, not, as is customary, here and there in the country, but in one city according to their selection, to the end that he may be better able to bring to bear the influence of the dignity that has fallen to him in resisting the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. Moreover, if any from the Council of Numidia should desire to come to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, permit them to do so; and stop any who may be disposed to bring charges against their character. Great increase of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will accrue to your Excellency with the Creator, if through you the union of the divided churches could be restored. For when He beholds the gifts granted by Him given back to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, He bestows gifts so much the more abundantly as He sees the dignity of His religion to be thereby enlarged. Furthermore, bestowing on you, as is due, the affection of our paternal charity, we beseech the Lord to make your arm strong for subduing your enemies, and to sharpen your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> like the edge of a quivering sword.</p>
