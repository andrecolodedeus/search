<h1>Book I, Letter 75</h1>

<p> <em>To Gennadius, Patrician, and Exarch throughout Africa.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Gennadius, Patrician, etc.</p>

<p>Had not such great success of the military exploits of your Excellency arisen from the merit of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, it would not have been so greatly to be wondered at, since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the like has been granted to military leaders of old time. But when, God granting it, you forestall future victories, not by carnal provision, but rather by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, it becomes a matter of astonishment how your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> comes down upon you, not from counsels of this world, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who bestows it from above. For where is not the renown of your deserts in people's mouths? And report goes that it is not from a desire of shedding blood that you constantly court these <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, but for the sake of extending the republic in which we see that God is worshipped, to the end that the name of Christ may be spread abroad through subject nations by preaching of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For, as your outward <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of valour make you eminent in this life, so also the inward adornment of your character, proceeding from a clean heart, glorifies you in making you partaker of celestial joys to come. For we have learned that your Excellency has done very many things of advantage for feeding the sheep of the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, so as to have restored to him no small portions of his patrimony, which had been denuded of their proper cultivators, by supplying them with Datitian settlers. Whatever, then, with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> disposition you confer on him, you receive retribution for through hope in the judgment to come. Wherefore we have thought fit to commend to your Eminence Hilarus , who is also the hearer of these presents, that you may bestow on him (though ever with regard to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>) your accustomed affection in matters wherein he may intimate his need of your help. Now, addressing to you the greeting of our paternal charity, we beseech our God and Saviour mercifully to protect your Eminence for the consolation of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> republic, and to fortify you with the strength of His arm for spreading His name more and more through the neighbouring nations.</p>
