<h1>Book I, Letter 77</h1>

<p> <em>To All the Bishops of Numidia.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to all the Bishops of Numidia.</p>

<p>If ever, most dear brethren in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, a troublesome mixture of tares intrudes itself among green grain, it is necessary for the hand of the husbandman to root it up entirely, lest the future fruit of the fertile grain should be obstructed. Wherefore let us too, who, however unworthy, have undertaken the cultivation of the field of the Lord, hasten to render the grain pure from all offense of tares, that the field of the Lord may fructify with more abundant increase. Now you requested through Hilarus our chartulary  from our predecessor of blessed memory that you might retain all the customs of past time, which, from the beginnings of the ordinances of the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, long antiquity has so far retained. And we, indeed, according to the tenour of your representation, allow your custom (so long as it clearly makes no claim to the prejudice of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>) to remain undisturbed, whether as to constituting primates or as to other points; save that with respect to those who attain to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> from among the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, we by all means forbid them to be advanced to the dignity of primacy, even though their standing should denote them for that position.  But let it suffice them to take care of the people committed to them, without aiming at the topmost place of the primacy in preference to those prelates whom the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has both taught and engendered in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Do you, therefore, most dear brethren, anticipate our admonitions in the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the charity of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the strict Judge will bring into examination all we do, and will approve every one of us with regard not to the prerogative of a higher rank, but to the merits of our works. I beseech you, therefore, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another mutually, having peace among yourselves in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and with one purpose of heart oppose <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Be solicitous for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of your neighbours: persuade all you can to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the preaching of charity, holding before them also the terror of the future judgment; inasmuch as you are appointed to be shepherds, and the Lord of the flocks expects from the shepherds to whom He has committed them the fruit of a multiplied flock. And if He should foresee an augmentation of His own flock through your bestowal of more diligent care upon it, He will assuredly adorn you with manifold gifts of the heavenly kingdom. Furthermore, addressing to you the greeting of fraternal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the Lord that He would make you, whom He has chosen to be shepherds of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, worthy in His sight, and Himself so order our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> here that He may accept them as they deserve in the future life.</p>
