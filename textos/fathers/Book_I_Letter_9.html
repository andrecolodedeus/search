<h1>Book I, Letter 9</h1>

<p> <em>To Peter the Subdeacon.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Peter, etc.</p>

<p>Gregory, a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and abbot of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint Theodore in the province of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> constituted in the territory of Panormus, has given us to understand that men of the farm of Fulloniacus, which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Roman Church, are endeavouring to encroach on the boundaries of the farm of Gerdinia, bordering on the said farm of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Roman Church, which they [<em>i.e. <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of St. Theodore</em>] have possessed without dispute for innumerable years. And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we desire you to go to the city of Panormus, and investigate the question in such sort (with the view of the right of possession remaining with those who have had it heretofore) that, if you shall find that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint Theodore has possessed the boundaries concerning which the dispute has arisen without disturbance for forty years, you shall not allow it to suffer any damage, even though it were to the advantage of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Roman Church, but provide in all ways for its undisturbed security. But, if the agents of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Roman Church should show that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> has not been in possession without dispute of its right for forty years, but that any question has been raised within that time concerning the said boundaries, let it be set at rest peaceably and legally by arbitrators chosen for the purpose. For not only do we wish that questions of wrong-doing that have never yet been mooted should be raised, but also that such as have been raised by others than ourselves should be speedily set at rest. Let your experience, therefore, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> all to be so effectively adjusted, that no question relating to this matter may be hereafter referred to us again. Further, we desire that the testament of Bacauda, late <em>Xenodochus</em>, continue valid as when first made.</p>

<p>The month of November: ninth Indiction.</p>
