<h1>Book VIII, Letter 14</h1>

<p> <em>To Boniface, First Guardian (Defensorem).</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Boniface concerning the privileges of Guardians. </p>

<p>Those who labour faithfully in the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should receive the benefit of suitable remuneration, so that both we may be seen to have made a worthy return for their services, and they may show themselves the more useful for the favour of the solace granted them. Seeing, then, that those who hold the office of Guardians are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to labour in the causes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and in the service of the pontiffs, we have thought fit that they should enjoy the following prerogatives, granted to them for recompense&mdash;appointing that, as in the school (<em>schola</em>) of notaries and subdeacons, through the indulgence of pontiffs long ago, there have been constituted <em>regionarii</em>, so also among the Guardians seven who may have commended themselves by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> utility shall be distinguished by the dignity of <em>regionarii</em>. And we appoint that these, in the absence of the pontiff, shall have leave to sit anywhere in any assembly of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and enjoy in all respects the privileges of their dignity. Furthermore, if any one, attaining to this position of priority, should by any chance live in another province for his own advantage, he must needs still occupy in all respects his place of priority, so that he may be the chief of all the guardians, as being one who, even before he obtained his position of priority, had not ceased by assiduous personal attention to devote himself to the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the service of the pontiff. These decrees, then, by us constituted, which have been ordained for the privileges and constitution of Guardians, we appoint to be kept in perpetual force and irrefragably;&mdash; whether such things as we have decreed in writing, or such as are seen to have been ordained in our presence: and we decree also that they shall not be upset or changed in whole or in part on any occasion whatever by any of the pontiffs. For it is a very harsh proceeding, and especially contrary to good conduct in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that any one should endeavour, under any manner of excuse, to rescind what has been well ordained, and also by his example to teach others to dissolve his own constitutions after his own time. The month of April, first Indiction.</p>
