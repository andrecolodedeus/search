<h1>Book VIII, Letter 23</h1>

<p> <em>To Fantinus, Guardian (Defensorem).</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Fantinus, etc.</p>

<p>From the information of the lady abbess of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint Stephen in the territory of Agrigentum we find that many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> inspiring them, wish to be converted to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but that it is necessary for some one to go there by our command. Accordingly we enjoin you, in virtue of the authority hereby given you, that, putting aside every excuse, you make haste to go to the aforesaid place, and with the favour of God aid their desire by your exhortations. If, however, it seems long and dreary for them to look forward to the Paschal <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, and you find them anxious for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> now, then lest long delay should possibly change their minds (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid), speak with our brother the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that place, that, penitence and abstinence having been prescribed them for forty days, he may <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them under the protection of the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> on a Lord's day, or on any very noted festival that may chance to occur; since the character of the present time too, on account of impending calamity, impels us not to defer the fulfilment of their desires by any procrastination. Further, whomsoever of them you ascertain to be poor and without sufficient means for buying vestments for themselves, we desire you to supply with vestments for their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the price that you may give for them is to be charged in your accounts. But, if they should choose to wait for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> season of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, speak again with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that they may for the present become <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, and that he may go to them frequently, and pay careful attention to them, and kindle their minds by the admonition of his exhortations, so that the more distant the expected festival is, the more may they prepare themselves and with fervent desire look forward to it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, let it be your care to enquire with all <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and diligence whether the above-named <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> over which the aforesaid lady presides has sufficient means, or whether it suffers any need. And whatever you may <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> ascertain, as well as what is done with respect to those who desire to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, make haste to inform us in full. The Month of June, first Indiction.</p>
