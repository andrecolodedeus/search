<h1>Book VIII, Letter 29</h1>

<p> <em>To Eulogius, Bishop of Alexandria.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Eulogius, etc.</p>

<p>An address from a learned man is always profitable, because the hearer either learns what he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> himself to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, or, what is more, comes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> he had been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of. A hearer of the latter kind I have now become, your most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Blessedness having been minded to write to me, asking me to send you the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, which were collected in the times of Constantine, of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, by Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea. But before receiving the letter of your Blessedness I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of these acts, whether they had been collected, or whether not. I therefore give thanks that, instructed by your most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> teaching, I have begun to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what I was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of. For beside what is contained about the acts of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the books of the same Eusebius, I am not aware of any collections in the archives of this our Church, or in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, unless it be some few things collected in one single volume. We have indeed the names of almost all the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, with their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> assigned to particular days, collected in one volume; and we celebrate the solemnities of mass on such days in commemoration of them. Yet it is not indicated in this volume who each was, and how he suffered; but only his name, the place, and day, of his passion are put down. Hence it results that many of various countries and provinces are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have been crowned with <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, as I have said, through their several days. But these we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you have. That, however, which you wish to have sent to you we have sought for, but have not found; but, though we have not found it, we will still search, and, if it can be found, will send it.</p>

<p> With regard to what you write about the timber being short in length, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> was in the kind of ship by which it was sent; for, if a larger ship had come, we could have sent larger pieces of timber. But as to your saying that, if we send larger pieces, you will pay for them, we thank you indeed for your liberality, but we are precluded from accepting a price, since the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> forbids it. For we do not buy the timber which we send; and how can we accept a price, when it is written, <em>Freely you have received, freely give</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse8">Matthew 10:8</a></span>? We have therefore sent now through the shipmaster timber of short length in accordance with the size of the ship, whereof a notice is subjoined. Next year, however, should it please Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we will prepare larger pieces.</p>

<p>We have received with the kindliness wherewith it was sent the blessing of <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Saint Mark the Evangelist</a>, nay, it may be said more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, of Saint Peter the Apostle ; and, greeting you well, we beg your Blessedness to deign to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, that so we may be counted worthy to be soon delivered from present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and not to be excluded from future joys.</p>
