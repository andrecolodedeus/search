<h1>Book VIII, Letter 33</h1>

<p> <em>To Dominicus.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Dominicus, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>.</p>

<p>The letter of your Holiness, which we received at the hands of the bearer of these presents, so expressed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> moderation as to soothe us, in a manner, with the bodily presence of its author. Nor indeed does infrequency of communication <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> any harm where the affection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> remains uninterrupted in one's mind. Great, moreover, is the power of charity, beloved brother, which binds hearts one to another in mutual affection with the chain of its sincerity, and suffers them not to be loosened from the cohesion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which conjoins things disjoined, keeps together things united, and causes <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are unknown by sight to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Whosoever therefore fixes his heart on the hinge of charity, him no impulse of any adversity whatever tears from the habitation of the heavenly country, since, in whatever direction he may turn himself, he parts not from the threshold of the commandments. Hence also it is said by the excellent preacher in praise of this same charity, <em>Which is the bond of perfectness</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse14">Colossians 3:14</a></span>. We see, then, what great praise is due to that which not only engenders perfectness in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but also binds it.</p>

<p>Wherefore, since the language of your letters shows you to be inflamed with the fire of this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord with abundant exultation, and hope that it may shine forth in you more and more, seeing that the flame of the shepherd is the light of the flock. For it becomes the Lord's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>  to shine in manners and life, to the end that the people committed to him may be able, as it were in the mirror of his life, both to choose what to follow, and to see what to correct.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a>, furthermore, whence <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> ordination took its beginning in the African parts, you act laudably in recurring with wise recollection, in your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, to the origin of your office, and in continuing with commendable constancy in your affection towards it.  For indeed it is certain that whatever reverence and devotion in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> wise you show to it, this you add to your own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; seeing that you hereby invite it to be bound with answering <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to you.</p>

<p>It remains, most dear brother, that we beseech <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> with continual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that He would direct the steps of our hearts into the pathway of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and bring us to the heavenly kingdoms, granting us by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His protection to exhibit in our works the office which we bear in name. The Month of August, first Indiction. </p>
