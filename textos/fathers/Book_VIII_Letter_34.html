<h1>Book VIII, Letter 34</h1>

<p> <em>To John Bishop of Scyllacium</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to John, etc.</p>

<p>It is evidently a very serious thing, and contrary to what a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should aim at, to wish to disturb privileges formerly granted to any <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and to endeavour to bring to naught what has been arranged for quiet. Now the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Castilliensian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in your Fraternity's city have complained to us that you are taking steps to impose upon the said <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> certain things contrary to what had been allowed by your predecessors and sanctioned by long custom, and to disturb ancient arrangements by a certain injurious novelty. Wherefore we hereby exhort your Fraternity that, if this is so, you refrain from troubling this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under any excuse, and that you try not, through any opportunity of usurpation, to upset what has been long secured to it, but that you study, without any gainsaying, to preserve all its privileges inviolate, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that no more is lawful to you with regard to the said <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> than was lawful to your predecessors.</p>

<p>Further, inasmuch as they have likewise complained that your Fraternity has taken certain things from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under the guise of their being, as it were, an offering , it is necessary that, if you recollect having received anything unbecomingly, you restore it without delay, lest the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> seriously convict you, whom <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> munificence ought to have shown liberal towards <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Therefore, while you preserve all things which, as we have said, have been allowed and preserved by your predecessors, let it be your care to keep careful watch over the acts and lives of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> residing there, and, if you should find any one living amiss, or (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) guilty of any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of uncleanness, to correct such by strict and regular emendation. For, as we desire your Fraternity to abstain from incongruous usurpations, so we admonish you to be in all ways solicitous in what pertains to rectitude of discipline and the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> have also informed us that the camp which is called Scillacium is built on ground belonging to their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and that on this account those who live there pledged themselves in writing  to pay a <em>solatium</em>  every year; but that they afterwards thought scorn of it, and idly withheld their stipulated payment. Let then your Fraternity take care to learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> accurately; and, if you should find it so, urgently see to their not delaying to give what they promised, and what also reason requires; that so both they may possess quietly what they hold, and the rights of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> may incur no damage.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> have complained to us that their abbot has granted to your Fraternity by title of gift land within the camp of Scillacium, to the extent of six hundred feet, under pretext of building a church: and accordingly it is our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that as much land as the walls of the church, when built, can surround shall be claimed as belonging to the church. But let whatever may be outside the walls of the said church revert without dispute to the possession of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. For the ordinances neither of worldly <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> nor of the sacred canons permit the property of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to be segregated by any title from its ownership. On this account restore this gift of land which has been granted against reason.</p>
