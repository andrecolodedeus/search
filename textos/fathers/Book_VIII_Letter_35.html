<h1>Book VIII, Letter 35</h1>

<p> <em>To Leontius, Ex-Consul.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Leontius, etc.</p>

<p>Since in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some indeed to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> but some to dishonour <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse20">2 Timothy 2:20</a></span>, who can be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that in the bosom of the Universal Church some as vessels of dishonour are deputed to the lowest uses, but others, as vessels of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, are fitted for clean uses. And yet it commonly comes to pass that the citizens of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> serve in task-work for Jerusalem, while the citizens of Jerusalem, that is of the heavenly country, are deputed to the task-work of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. For when the elect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, endowed with moral excellence, distinguished for moderation, seeking not their own gain, are deputed to earthly business, what else is it but that the citizens of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Jerusalem serve in the work of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>? And when some, unbridled in immorality, hold places of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> dignity, and in the very things which they seem to do well seek praise to themselves, what else is it but that the citizens of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> execute the task-work of the heavenly Jerusalem? For so Judas, mixed with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, long preached the Redeemer of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and did signs with the rest; but, because he had been a citizen of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, he executed his work as task-work for the heavenly Jerusalem. But on the other hand Joseph, being carried into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, served an earthly court, bore the charge of administration in temporal things, exhibited whatever was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> due to a transitory kingdom; but, because he was still a citizen of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Jerusalem, he administered the service of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, as has been seen above, in the way of task-work only. A follower of him, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you to be, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> you, though involved in earthly action, to act with a gentle spirit, to keep in all respects the citadel of humility, and to give to every one what is just. For such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are reported by many of your Glory that I would fain not hear of such things, but see them: yet still I am fed by the good renown of him whom I am not allowed to see. But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who poured from the alabaster box, exhibiting a type of the Holy Church, that is of all the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, filled the house with the ointment <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm">Luke 7</a></span>. And we, as often as we hear anything of good people, draw in as it were through our nostrils a breath of sweetness. And when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Apostle said, We are a good odour of Christ unto God <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse15">2 Corinthians 2:15</a></span>, it is plainly given to be understood that he exhibited himself as a savour indeed to the present, but as an odour to the absent. We therefore, while we cannot be nourished by the savour of your presence, are so by the odour of your absence.</p>

<p>For this also we greatly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, that the gifts which you sent us were not unlike your character. For indeed we received oil of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> cross , and wood of aloes; one to bless by the touch, the other to give a sweet smell when kindled. For it was becoming that a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man should send us things that might appease the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God against us.</p>

<p>Many other things also you have sent for our store-houses, since, as we subsist both in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and in flesh, it was needful that we should be sustained in both. And yet in transmitting these things your most sweet <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> declares that it blushes much for shame, and holds out the shield of charity before this same shame-facedness. But I altogether <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in these words, since from this attestation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he can never take away what is another's who blushes even in bestowing what is his own. Your gifts however, which you call small, are great: but I think that your Glory's very humility enhances them yet the more. And you beg me to receive them kindly. But meanwhile recall to your memory the two mites of a certain <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk027.htm">Luke 27</a></span>. For, if she pleased God who offered a little with a good will, why should not he please men who with a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> mind has given much? Furthermore we send you, as a blessing from Saint Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, a key of his most sacred sepulchre, in which is inserted a blessing from his chains , that what bound his neck for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> may loose yours from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>
