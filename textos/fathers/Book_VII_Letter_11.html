<h1>Book VII, Letter 11</h1>

<p> <em>To Rufinus, Bishop of Ephesus.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Rufinus, etc.</p>

<p>The charity of your acts of friendship in the past has moved us to visit your Fraternity with the present letter. For we have been refreshed with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> by learning from reports given us of your health that all is well with you. But, while this is so, we implore Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that as in the present life, which is as it were a shadow of the future one, He has granted you to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the transitory welfare of your body, so in that heavenly country wherein is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life He may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us to give thanks and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with a common exultation for the perfected <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now the bearer of this, desiring to be commended to you by a letter from us, having been asked by us whether he had learned letters as becomes a clerk, replied that he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of them. What further commendation, then, with regard to him I should give to your Fraternity I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; except that you should be solicitous about his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and watch over him with pastoral <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, so that, as he cannot read, your tongue may be a book to him, and that in the goodness of your preaching and work he may see what to follow. For the living voice usually draws the heart more closely than perfunctory reading. But, while, as his master, you supply him inwardly with this spiritual teaching, let not outward care for him also be wanting, that by its aid he come to long for spiritual things, and lest, if such aid is slighted, you should no longer have one to preach to.</p>
