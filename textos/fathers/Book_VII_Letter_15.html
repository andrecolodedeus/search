<h1>Book VII, Letter 15</h1>

<p> <em>To George, Presbyter.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to George, Presbyter, and to Theodore, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople.</p>

<p>Mindful of your goodness and charity, I greatly blame myself, that I gave you leave to return so soon: but, since I saw you pressing me importunately once and again for leave to go, I considered that it might be a serious matter for your Love to tarry with us longer. But, after I had learned that you had lingered so long on your journey owing to the winter season, I confess that I was sorry that you had been sent away so soon. For, if your Love was unable to accomplish your intended journey, it had been better that you had lingered with me than away from me.</p>

<p>Moreover, after your departure I learned from information given me by my most beloved sons the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> that your Love had said that our Almighty Lord and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, when He descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, saved all who there acknowledged Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and delivered them from the pains due to them. With regard to this subject I desire that your Charity should think very differently. For, when He descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, He delivered through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> those only who both <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He should come and observed His precepts in their lives. For it is evident that after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Lord no one can be saved, even of those who hold His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who have not the life of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; since it is written, <em>They acknowledge that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> they deny Him</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse16">Titus 1:16</a></span>. And John says, <em>He that says that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him, and keeps not His commandments, is a liar</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse4">1 John 2:4</a></span>. James also, the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>, writes saying, <em>Faith without works is dead</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse20">James 2:20</a></span>. If, then, <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> now are not saved without good works, while the unbelieving and reprobate without good action were saved by our Lord descending into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, then the lot of those who never saw the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Lord was better than that of these who have been born after the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>. But what fatuity it argues to say or think this the Lord Himself testifies to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, when He says, <em>Many kings and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have desired to see the things which you see, and have not seen them</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse17">Matthew 13:17</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse24">Luke 10:24</a></span>. But, that I may not detain your Love with argument of my own, learn what Philaster, in the book which he wrote about <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, says about this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. His words are these; <q>They are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who say that the Lord descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and announced himself after death to all who were already there, so that in acknowledging Him there they might be saved; seeing that this is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David where he says, <em>But in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> who shall acknowledge you</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa006.htm#verse6">Psalm 6:6</a></span>? And to the Apostle; <em>As many as have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> without law shall perish without law</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse12">Romans 2:12</a></span>.</q> And with his words the blessed Augustine also agrees in the book which he wrote about <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.</p>

<p>Considering, therefore, all these things, hold nothing but what the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> teaches through the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: namely, that the Lord in descending into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> rescued from infernal durance those only whom while living in the flesh He preserved through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and good conduct. For in that which He says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <em>When I shall be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to myself</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse32">John 12:32</a></span>, He means all that are elect. For one could not be drawn to God after death who had separated himself from God by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> living. May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> keep you under His protection, that, wherever you are, you may feel in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body the aid of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>
