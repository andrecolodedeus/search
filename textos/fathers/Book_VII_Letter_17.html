<h1>Book VII, Letter 17</h1>

<p> <em>To Sabinianus, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Sabinianus, Bishop of Jadera. </p>

<p>If you had been at pains to weigh with careful consideration the rule of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration and the order of ancient custom, neither would any fault of unlawful presumption have crept in upon you, nor would others have incurred danger by occasion of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that you were aware how that, certain things having come to our ears about Maximus which were no slight bar to his advancement to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, we had not given our assent to it, and that it was our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that he should not attain to what he strove after till there had been adequate satisfaction concerning the things that were said. But, when you ought by all means to have observed this, it came rather to pass that he, snatching at the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> with the greediness of a blind <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, inclined you unwarily to favour him in spite of our prohibition. But, lest even then the things that had been reported to us should remain unexamined, he was summoned to come hither by letters from us. And, when he was so perversely inclined as to defer doing so, we took care to admonish him in repeated letters, under pain of interdiction from communion, to make haste to come to us for his purification, putting aside all excuses: but he chose rather to submit to excommunication than to evince <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. Whence the result is (awful to be said), that the pravity of his perverse disposition involves others in his own perdition. Now however, inasmuch as we have learned that you dissent from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, we exhort you by the present writing (that so it may profit your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to have severed yourself, even though late, from him) that you henceforth neither communicate with him nor make mention of his name in the sacred solemnities of mass; and also that you defer not coming to us without delay, yea and bring others with you too, such as you can, whether <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or other religious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, so that (the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> being thoroughly examined), both your absolution, should the case require it, may fittingly and decently ensue, and that those who have fallen into the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the like temerity may be recalled to the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, with the help of the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, by an arrangement well-pleasing to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Moreover, let any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or religious person that may come to us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he will sustain no prejudice or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, but that all will be arranged so as to please our Redeemer after full ascertainment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; to the end that even from our way of ordering the matter, with the Lord's approval, it may appear to all that we are not moved by private grudge against any man, but by <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for God and for the adjustment of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order.</p>
