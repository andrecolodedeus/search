<h1>Book VII, Letter 25</h1>

<p> <em>To Gregoria.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Gregoria, Lady of the Bed-chamber (<em>cubiculari&aelig;</em>) to Augusta.</p>

<p>I have received the longed for letters of your Sweetness, in which you have been at pains all through to accuse yourself of a multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you fervently <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Almighty Lord, and I trust in His mercy that the sentence which was pronounced with regard to a certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> proceeds from the mouth of the Truth with regard to you: <em>Her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are many, are forgiven her, for she loved much</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse47">Luke 7:47</a></span>. And how they were forgiven is shown also by what follows afterwards; that she sat at the Lord's feet, and heard the word from His mouth <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse39">Luke 10:39</a></span>.  For, being rapt in the contemplative, she had transcended the active life, which Martha her sister still pursued (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ib. 40). She also sought earnestly her buried Lord, and, stooping over the sepulchre, found not His body. But, even when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> went away, she remained standing before the door of the sepulchre, and whom she sought as dead, Him she was counted worthy to see alive, and announced to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that He had risen again. And this was by the wonderful dispensation of the loving-kindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that life should be announced by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> mouth, because by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> mouth had been the first taste of death in Paradise. And at another time also, with another Mary, she saw the Lord after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, and held His feet. Bring before your eyes, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, what hands held whose feet. That <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who had been a sinner in the city, those hands which had been polluted with iniquity, touched the feet of Him who sits at the right hand of the Father above all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Let us estimate, if we can, what those bowels of heavenly loving-kindness are, that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who had been plunged through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> into the whirlpool's depth should be thus lifted high on the wing of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. It is fulfilled, sweet daughter, it is fulfilled, what was promised to us by the prophetic voice concerning this time of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church: <em>And in that day the house of David shall be an open fountain for ablution of the sinner and of her that is unclean</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/zec013.htm#verse1">Zechariah 13:1</a></span>. For the house of David is an open fountain for ablution to us sinners, because we are washed from the filth of our iniquities by mercy now disclosed through the son of David our Saviour.</p>

<p>But as to what your Sweetness has added in your letters, namely that you will continue to be urgent with me till I write that it has been revealed to me that your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven, you have demanded a difficult, nay even an unprofitable thing; difficult indeed, because I am unworthy of having a revelation made to me; but unprofitable, because you ought not to become secure about your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, except when in the last day of your life you shall be able no longer to bewail them. But, until that day comes, you ought, ever suspicious and ever fearful, to be afraid of faults, and wash them with daily tears. Assuredly the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had already ascended into the third heaven, had also been caught up into Paradise, and heard secret words which it was not lawful for a man to speak <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, etc.</span>, and yet, still fearful, he said, <em>I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means, while preaching to others, I myself should become a castaway</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse27">1 Corinthians 9:27</a></span>. One who is caught up into heaven still fears; and shall one whose conversation is still on earth desire already not to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? Consider, most sweet daughter, that security is wont to be the mother of carelessness. You ought not, then, in this life to have security, whereby you may be rendered careless. For it is written, <em>Happy is the man that is always afraid</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse14">Proverbs 28:14</a></span>. And again it is written, <em>Serve the Lord in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> unto him with trembling</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa002.htm#verse11">Psalm 2:11</a></span>. In short, then, it must needs be that in the time of this life trembling possess your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to the end that it may hereafter <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> without end through the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of security. May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> fill your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and, after the tears which you daily shed in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, bring you to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> joys.</p>
