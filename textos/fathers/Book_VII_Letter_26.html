<h1>Book VII, Letter 26</h1>

<p> <em>To Theoctista, Patrician</em> </p>

<p>Gregory to Theoctista, etc.</p>

<p>That your Excellency, though placed in so great a tumult of affairs, is full of the fruitfulness of the sacred word, and incessantly pants after <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> joys, for this I give great thanks to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in that in you I see fulfilled what is written of the elect fathers, <em>But the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> walked on dry land through the midst of the sea</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse19">Exodus 15:19</a></span>. But on the other hand, <em>I have come into the depth of the sea, and the storm has overwhelmed me</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa068.htm#verse3">Psalm 68:3</a></span>.  But you, as I see, walk with dry feet through the waves of secular affairs to the country of promise. Let us give thanks, then, to that Spirit who lifts up the hearts which He fills; who amid the tumults of men makes a solitude in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and in whose presence there is no place, wherein a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> moved by compunction can be, which is not a secret one. For you inhale the odour of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> sweetness, and so ardently <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the bridegroom of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as to be able to say with the heavenly bride, <em>Draw me after you; we run in the odour of your ointments</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse3">Song of Songs 1:3</a></span>. But in the letters of your Excellency I find this deficiency; that you have been unwilling to tell me about your most serene mistress, how studiously she reads, or how she is moved by compunction in her reading. For your presence ought to be of great advantage to her, that amid the billows of affairs under which she continually suffers and by which, whether she will or no, she is drawn abroad, she may be recalled inwardly to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the heavenly country. And this also you ought to investigate, as often as tears are given her for her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whether her compunction arises still from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, or whether now from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. </p>

<p>For there are two kinds of compunction, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: one that is afraid of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> pains, the other that sighs for heavenly rewards; since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is thirsty for God is first moved to compunction by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and afterwards by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For in the first place it is affected to tears because, while recollecting its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doings, it fears to suffer for them <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishments. But, when <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> has died away in the anxiety of a long sorrow, a certain security has birth from a sense of pardon; and the mind is enflamed with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of heavenly joys. And one who previously wept for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment begins afterwards to weep most bitterly for being kept back from the kingdom. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> contemplates what are those choirs of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, what is the very society of blessed spirits, what the vision of the inward brightness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and laments more for the lack of unending good than it wept before when it feared <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and thus it comes to pass that the compunction of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, when perfected, draws the mind to the compunction of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. All this is well described in the sacred and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> history, understood figuratively, which says, <em>Axa the daughter of Caleph sighed sitting on an ass. And her father said to her, What would you? Who answered, Give me a blessing, You have given me a South and dry land; give me also a watered land. And her father gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jos015.htm#verse18">Joshua 15:18</a></span>.  For indeed Axa sits on an ass, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> presides over the irrational motions of the flesh. And sighing she seeks a watered land from her father, because the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of tears is to be sought with great longing from our Creator. For there are some who have already freely received the gift of speaking in behalf of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, of protecting the oppressed, of giving of their own to the needy, of having ardour of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but have not yet the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of tears. These, that is to say, have a South and dry land, but still need springs of water; because, while they are occupied in good works, wherein they are great and fervent, they have still sore need (either from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment, or from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the heavenly kingdom) to lament the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which they cannot be without while they live. But since, as I have said, there are two kinds of compunction, her father gave her the upper springs and the nether springs. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receives the upper springs, when she afflicts herself in tears for desire of the heavenly kingdom; but she receives the nether springs, when she shudders with weeping at the punishments of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. And indeed the nether springs are given first, and the upper springs afterwards. But, because the compunction of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is far above the other indignity, there was need for the upper springs to be mentioned first, and the nether springs afterwards. You then, who through the operation of the Almighty Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by experience both kinds of compunction, ought anxiously to try to discover day by day how much you are profiting your most serene mistress by your words.</p>

<p>Further, I beg you to take special care to instruct in good morals the little lords whom you are bringing up, and to admonish the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> eunuchs who are appointed to attend them that they should speak to them such things as may move their minds to mutual charity between themselves and to gentleness towards subjects; lest, if they should conceive now any grudge against each other, it should break out openly hereafter. For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the words of those who bring up children will be either milk, if they are good, or poison if they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Let them therefore so speak now to the little ones that the latter may show hereafter what good words they had sucked from the mouths of those who nursed them.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my beloved son, Sabinianus the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, has brought thirty pounds of gold, sent by your Excellency to be given for the redemption of captives and for distribution to the poor; with regard to which I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, but tremble for myself, seeing that I shall have to render an account before the tremendous Judge, not only of the substance of Saint Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but also of your possessions. But to you may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> return heavenly things for earthly, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> for temporal. I have now to inform you that from the city of Crotona, which, lying on the Adriatic Sea in the land of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was taken last year by the Lombards, many noble men and many noble <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were led away captive, and children were parted from their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> from their children, husbands from their wives, and wives from their husbands; of whom some have already been redeemed. But, because of the heavy prices put upon them, many have remained so far in the hands of those most abominable Lombards. But I sent at once for their redemption a moiety of the money sent by you. Out of the other moiety I have arranged for the purchase of bed-clothes for the handmaidens of God whom you in Greek language call <em>monastri&aelig;;</em> seeing that they suffer from grievous bareness in their beds during the very severe cold of this winter; there being many of them in this city. For, according to the official list of them, they are found to be three thousand in number. They do indeed receive fourscore pounds a year from the possessions of Saint Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. But what is this for so great a multitude, especially in this city, where everything is so dear? Their life, moreover, is such, and strict to such a degree in tears and abstinence, that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, but for them, not one of us could have subsisted for so many years in this place among the swords of the Lombards.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I send you, as a blessing from Saint Peter the apostle, a key from his most sacred body; with respect to which key the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> has been wrought which I now relate. A certain Lombard, having found it on his entrance into a city in the parts beyond the Po, and, paying no regard to it as Saint Peter's key, but wishing to make something of it for himself in that he saw it to be of gold, took out a knife to cut it. But presently seized by a spirit, he plunged the knife wherewith he had thought to cut it into his own throat, and in the same hour fell down dead. And when Autharith, king of the Lombards , and many others belonging to him came to the place, and he who had stabbed himself was lying apart in one place dead, and this key on the ground in another, exceeding <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> came upon all, so that no one ventured to lift this same key from the ground. Then a certain Lombard who was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be given to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and almsgiving, Minulf by name, was called, and himself lifted it from the ground. But Autharith, in consideration of this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, made another golden key, and sent it along with this to my predecessor of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, declaring what kind of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> had through it occurred. I have taken thought, then, to send your Excellence this key, through which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> cut off a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and faithless man, that through it you who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him may be enabled to have both present and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> welfare.</p>
