<h1>Book VII, Letter 27</h1>

<p> <em>To Anastasius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Anastasius, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</p>

<p>I have received through the hands of our common son the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Sabinianus the longed for letter of your most sweet Holiness, in which the words have flowed not from your tongue but from your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And it is not surprising that one speaks well who lives perfectly. And, since you have learned, through the Spirit teaching you in the school of the heart, the precepts of life&mdash; to despise all earthly things and to speed to the heavenly country&mdash;in proportion as you have advanced in good you think what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others. But, when I heard many things said in the letters of your Blessedness in praise of me, I understood your intention; how that you wished to describe not what I am, but what I ought to be. But as to your saying that I ought to remember my manner of life, and on no account give place to the malignant spirit who seeks to sift <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, I indeed recollect myself to have been always of bad manner of life, and hasten to overcome and put an end to this my manner of life, if I can. If however, as you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, I have had anything good in me, I trust in the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that I have not forgotten it. But your Holiness, as I see, by the words of sweetness at the beginning and the words that follow, has wished your letter to be like a bee, which carries both honey and a sting, satiating me with the honey and piercing me with the sting. But meanwhile I return to meditation on the words of Solomon, <em>That better are the wounds of one that loves than the kisses of a flattering foe</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse6">Proverbs 27:6</a></span>. Thus, as to your saying that we ought not to give occasion of offense for no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> at all, this is what your son, our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord (for whose life we ought continually to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>) has already written repeatedly; and what he says out of power I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you say out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Nor do I wonder that you have made use of imperial language in your letters, since there is a very close relationship between <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and power. For both presume in a princely way; both ever speak with authority.</p>

<p>And indeed on the receipt of the synodical epistle of our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Cyriacus it was not worth my while to make a difficulty on account of the profane title at the risk of disturbing the unity of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church: but nevertheless I took care to admonish him with respect to this same superstitious and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> title, saying that he could not have peace with us unless he corrected the elation of the aforesaid expression, which the first <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> invented. You, however, ought not to say that this is a matter of no consequence, since, if we bear it with equanimity, we are corrupting the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Universal Church; for you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how many not only <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> but heresiarchs have issued from the Constantinopolitan Church. And, not to speak of the injury done to your dignity, if one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is called Universal, the Universal Church comes to ruin, if the one who is universal falls. But far, far be this levity from my ears. Yet I trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that what He has promised He will soon fulfil; <em>Whosoever exalts himself shall be humbled</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse11">Luke 14:11</a></span>.</p>

<p>So much, in the midst of many occupations. I have briefly replied to what you have said in your letters: for what I ought not just now to express in writing remains imprinted on my mind. I beg your Blessedness always to recall me to your memory in your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, that so your intercessions may rescue me from temporal and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> ills. Pray moreover <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> and fervently for the most serene lord the Emperor; for his life is very necessary for the world. I refrain from saying more, for I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</p>
