<h1>Book VII, Letter 28</h1>

<p> <em>To Theodore, Physician.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Theodore, Physician at Constantinople.</p>

<p>My most beloved son the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Sabinianus , on his return to me, brought me no letter from your Glory; but he conveyed hither what had been sent for the poor and captives; whence I understood the reason. It was that you would not speak by letters to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, having by a good deed made your address to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>. For this same deed of yours has a voice of its own, which calls to the secret ears of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as it is written, <em>Hide your <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and it shall entreat for you</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir029.htm#verse15">Sirach 29:15</a></span>. And indeed to me, I confess, it is sad to expend what is not my own, and to add to the accounts which I keep of the substance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> those also of the property of my most sweet son the lord Theodore. And yet I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with your benignity that you carefully attend to and observe what the Truth says; <em>Give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and behold, all things are clean unto you</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse41">Luke 11:41</a></span>; and this which is written, <em>Even as water quenches fire, so <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> quench <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse33">Sirach 3:33</a></span>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle also says, <em>Let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may be a supply to your want</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 8:14</a></span>. Tobias admonishes his son, saying, <em>If you have much, give abundantly; but if you have little, of that little impart willingly</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tob004.htm#verse9">Tobit 4:9</a></span>. You therefore observe all these precepts: but we beg you to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, lest we should dispense the fruits of your labours indiscreetly, and not as need requires; lest from that whereby you diminish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> we should heap up <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> keep you under His protection, and so grant you <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> favour in an earthly court as to bring you after a long life to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> joys of a heavenly court.</p>

<p>We send you as the benediction of Saint Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, whom you greatly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, a key from his most sacred body, in which is enclosed iron from his chains, that what bound his neck for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, may loose yours from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>
