<h1>Book VII, Letter 30</h1>

<p> <em>To Narses, the Religious (Nars&aelig; Relegioso)</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Narses, etc.</p>

<p>When I was sending Romanus the guardian (<em>defensorem</em>) to the royal city, he sought long your letters, but they could not be found: but afterwards they were found among many letters from other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, your Sweetness, therein telling me of your afflictions and tribulations of spirit, and making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the oppositions to you of bad men. But, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, in all this recall to your mind what I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> too that you never forget, <em>That all who will live godly in Christ suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse12">2 Timothy 3:12</a></span>. And with regard to this I confidently say that you would live less godly if you suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> less. For let us hear what else the same teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> says to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; <em>Yourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain; for we had before suffered and been shamefully entreated</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse1">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a></span>. Lo, most sweet son, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> preacher declared that his entrance would have been of no effect, if he had not been shamefully entreated; and your Charity wishes to say <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, but refuses to endure <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. Wherefore you must needs gird yourself up more tightly in the midst of adverse circumstances, that adversity itself may the more increase your desire for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and your earnestness in good works. So the seeds of harvests germinate the more fruitfully for being covered over with frost; so fire is kept down by a blast, that it may grow greater. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indeed that from the perverse speeches of so many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tongues you endure a violent storm, and bearest in your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> billows of contradictions. But remember what the Lord says by the Psalmist, <em>I heard you in the secret place of storm; I <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> you at the waters of contradiction</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa080.htm#verse8">Psalm 80:8</a></span>.  For, if in the midst of them that contradict you do the things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then you are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worker.</p>

<p>Further, your most sweet Charity has written to me that I should write something in the way of admonition to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which, through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and influence, have been instituted by our son the lord <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. But, if they are vessels of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they have through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of compunction a fountain of wisdom within, and ought not to take in the little drops of my dryness. Further, your perfect wisdom recollects that in Paradise there was no rain, but a fountain ascended from the midst of Paradise to water the face of the ground. Those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, then, that through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of compunction have a fountain in themselves have no need of rain from another's tongue.</p>

<p>Further, you inform me in your letter of the passing away of the lady Esychia ; and I rejoiced with great exultation that that good <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which laboured in a foreign country, has arrived happily at its own. Further, greet in my behalf my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> daughters, the lady Dominica and the lady Eudochia. But, inasmuch as I hear that it is now a long time since the aforesaid lady Dominica was made a prioress, let your Charity watch over her in this regard; that, as she is no longer compelled to serve in the toil of an earthy court, she may fly perfectly from all noises of this world, devote herself entirely to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and leave no part of herself outside herself; but that she also gather together as many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> as she can to the service of her Creator, that their minds through her word may receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of compunction, and that she herself may so much the more speedily be absolved from all her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as, through her life and her tongue, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of others also shall have broken loose from the bands of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Moreover, since no one among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in this world is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (and what else is sinning but flying from God?), I say confidently that this my daughter also has some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Wherefore, that she may perfectly satisfy her mistress, that is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Wisdom, let her, who fled alone, return with many. For the guilt of turning away will be imputed to no one who in returning brings back gain.</p>

<p>Further, I beg you to greet in my behalf the lord Alexander and the lord Theodorus. But with respect to your saying in your letter that I ought to write to my most excellent daughter the lady Gurdia, and her most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> daughter the lady Theoctista , and their magnificent husbands, the lord Marinus and the lord Christidorus, and to give them some admonition about their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, your most sweet Greatness well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that there are none at present in the city of Constantinople who can translate well into Greek what has been dictated in Latin. For keeping to the words, but attending little to the sense, they both fail to make the words understood and also mangle the sense. On this account I have written shortly to my aforesaid daughter the lady Gurdia; but have not addressed the others. Further, I have sent you two <em>camisi&aelig;</em> and four <em>oraria</em>, which I beg may be humbly offered, with the blessing of St. Peter, to the aforesaid men. Besides, a certain person on his death has left me by will a little boy; taking thought for whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, I have sent him to your Sweetness, that he may live in this world in the service of one through whom he may be able to attain to the liberty of heaven. Further, I beg your most sweet Charity to visit frequently my most beloved son, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Anatolius, whom I have sent to represent the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the royal city, that after the toils which he endures in secular causes he may find rest with you in the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and wipe away the sweat of this his earthly toil as it were with a kind of white napkin. Commend him to all who are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you, though I am sure that, if he is perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, he needs no commendation. Yet do you show with regard to him how much you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, and me. Now may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> guard your Charity, to me most sweet, from enemies within and without, and, when it shall please Him, bring you to heavenly kingdoms.</p>
