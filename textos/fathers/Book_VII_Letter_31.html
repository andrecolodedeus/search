<h1>Book VII, Letter 31</h1>

<p> <em>To Cyriacus, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Cyriacus, Bishop of Constantinople.</p>

<p>We have received the letters of your Blessedness, which speak to us in words not of the tongue but of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For they open to me your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which, however, was not closed to me, since of myself I retain experience of the same sweetness. Wherefore I return thanks continually to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since, if charity the mother of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> abides in your heart towards us, you will never lose the branches of good works, seeing that you retain the very root of goodness. You ought, then, to show the beauty of this charity to me and to all your brethren by this good work in the first place&mdash;your hastening to discard that word of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> whereby grave offense is engendered in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, thus fulfilling in all ways what is written, <em>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse3">Ephesians 4:3</a></span>: and again, <em>Give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse14">1 Timothy 5:14</a></span>. For then will <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> charity be displayed, if there is no <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> among us through an example of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For, as for me, I call Jesus to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that to no one among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from the highest to the lowest do I wish to give occasion of offense. I desire that all should be great and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, yet so that their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> detract not from the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>. For whoso <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> to be honoured against God to me is not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>. But, that you may learn what good will I have towards your Blessedness, I have sent my son the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Anatolius to the feet of our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lords, for satisfying their Piety and your Fraternity that I desire to injure no man in this matter, but to keep the humility that is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the concord of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church. And because <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, the enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is near at hand, I studiously desire the he may not find anything belonging to himself, not only in the manners, but even in the titles of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Let then what has been introduced after a new fashion be removed in like manner as it was brought in, and peace in the Lord will remain with us inviolate. For what pleasantness, what charity, will there be among us, if we cheer ourselves up with words, while we are galled by facts? Let then your Holiness so act that we may feel in our inmost hearts the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things you speak of, to the end that, the hearts of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> being in unanimity, when we supplicate for the life of our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lords, we may be counted worthy to be heard all the more as peace illuminates your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> before the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and no stain of discord darkens them.</p>
