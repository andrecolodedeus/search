<h1>Book VII, Letter 33</h1>

<p> <em>To Mauricius Augustus.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Mauricius Augustus.</p>

<p>The provident <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of my lords, lest perchance any scandal might be engendered in the unity of Holy Church by the dissension of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, has once and again deigned to admonish me to receive kindly the representatives of my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Cyriacus, and to give them liberty to return soon. And although, most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord, all your injunctions are suitable and provident, yet I find that by such an admonition I am reproved as being in your judgment indiscreet. But, even though my mind has been wounded in no slight degree by a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and profane title, could I possibly be guilty of so great indiscretion as not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what I owed to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> concord, and to refuse to receive the representatives and the synodical letter of my brother on account of bitterness from whatever <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> intervening? Far be this from me. Such wisdom had been unwisdom. For what is due from us for conserving unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is one thing; what is due for restraining elation is another. Times therefore were to be distinguished, lest the newness of my aforesaid brother might in any point be disturbed.  Whence also I received his representatives with great affection. Whatever charity I owed to them I displayed, and honoured them more than it had been the ancient custom to do, and caused them to celebrate the sacred solemnities of mass with me; since, even as my <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> ought not to serve, for exhibition of the sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, him who has either committed the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of elation or corrects it not himself when committed by others, so it was right that his ministers should attend, in the celebration of mass, on me, who, under the keeping of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have not fallen into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</p>

<p>I have however taken care to admonish earnestly the same my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that, if he desires to have peace and concord with all, he must refrain from the appellation of a foolish title. As to this, the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of my lords has charged me in their orders, saying that offense ought not to be engendered among us for the appellation of a frivolous name. But I beseech your imperial Piety to consider that some frivolous things are very harmless, and others exceedingly harmful. Is it not the case that, when <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> comes and calls himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it will be very frivolous, and yet exceedingly pernicious? If we regard the quantity of the language used, there are but a few syllables; but if the weight of the wrong, there is universal disaster. Now I confidently say that whosoever calls himself, or desires to be called, Universal Priest, is in his elation the precursor of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, because he proudly puts himself above all others. Nor is it by dissimilar <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> that he is led into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; for, as that perverse one wishes to appear as above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so whosoever this one is who <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> being called sole <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he extols himself above all other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. But, since the Truth says, <em>Every one that exalts himself shall be humbled</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse11">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse14">18:14</a></span>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that every kind of elation is the sooner burst as it is the more inflated. Let then your Piety charge those who have fallen into an example of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> not to generate any offense by the appellation of a frivolous name. For I, a sinner, who by the help of God retain humility, need not to be admonished to humility. Now may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> long guard the life of our most serene Lord for the peace of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church and the advantage of the Roman republic. For we are sure, that if you live who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord of heaven, you will allow no <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> doings to prevail against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>
