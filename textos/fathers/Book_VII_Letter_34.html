<h1>Book VII, Letter 34</h1>

<p> <em>To Eulogius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Eulogius, Bishop of Alexandria, and Anastasius, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. </p>

<p>The charity wherewith I am greatly bound to you allows me by no means to keep silence, that your Holiness may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all that is going on among us, and, deceived by no false rumours, may keep more perfectly the way of your <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and rectitude, as you have perfectly begun to do. Now the representatives (<em>responsales</em>) of our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Cyriacus came to me, bringing me his synodical epistle. And indeed between us and him there is, as your Blessedness <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, serious difference on account of the appellation of a profane name; but I thought that his representatives sent in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ought to be received, lest the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of elation which has arisen in the Constantinopolitan Church almost against all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, might <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a shaking of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and a breach in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity. I also caused the same representatives, inasmuch as they very humbly requested it, to celebrate with me the solemnities of mass, because, as I have taken care to intimate to the most serene lord the Emperor, it was right that the representatives of our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Cyriacus should communicate with me, since by God's help I have not fallen into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of elation. But my <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> ought not to celebrate the solemnities of mass with our aforesaid-brother Cyriacus, since, through a profane title, he has either committed or accedes to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; lest if he (my <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>) proceeds  with one who is in such a position of elation, we might seem (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) to confirm the vanity of that foolish name. But I have taken care to admonish our said brother to correct himself of such elation, since, if he does not correct it, he will in no way have peace with us.</p>

<p>Furthermore, our said brother in his synodical letters has by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God expressed himself in all respects as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. But he has condemned a certain Eudoxius, whom we find neither condemned in synods, nor repudiated by his predecessors in their synodical letters.  It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the canons of the council of Constantinople condemn the Eudoxians; but they say nothing as to who their author Eudoxius was. But the Roman Church does not possess so far these same canons, or the acts of that council, nor has it accepted them, though it has accepted this same synod with regard to what was defined by it against Macedonius. It does certainly repudiate the other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> therein spoken of, which had already been condemned by other Fathers: but so far it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing about the Eudoxians. Some things are indeed told in Sozomen's history about a certain Eudoxius, who is said to have usurped the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople. But this history itself the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> refuses to accept, since it contains many false statements, and praises <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> too much, and says that he was a great doctor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> even to the day of his death. It remains then that, if any one receives that history, he contradicts the synod held in the times of Justinian of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory concerning the three chapters. But one who cannot contradict this synod must needs reject that history. Moreover in the Latin language we have so far found nothing about this Eudoxius, either in Philaster or in the blessed Augustine, who wrote much about <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Let therefore your Charity inform me in your letters if any one of the approved Fathers among the Greeks has made mention of him.</p>

<p>Furthermore three years ago, with reference to the case of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Isauria, who were accused as being <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> , my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the lord John once sent me letters for my satisfaction, in which he attempted to show that they had contradicted the definitions of the synod of Ephesus; and he forwarded to me certain chapters, purporting to be those of the same synod, which they were said to oppose.  Now among other things it was in these chapters asserted concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Adam, that by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> it did not die, in that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> does not enter into the heart of man; and that whoso said it was so was <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. When this was read to me I was much grieved. For if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Adam, who was the first to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, did not die by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, how was it said to him concerning the forbidden tree, <em>In the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse17">Genesis 2:17</a></span>? And certainly <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> ate of the forbidden tree, and yet in their flesh they lived afterwards more than nine hundred years. It is therefore evident that in his flesh he did not die. If then he did not die in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the impious conclusion follows that God pronounced a false sentence concerning him, when He said that in the day that he ate he should die. But far be this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, far be it from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For what we say is, that the first man died in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the day that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and that through him the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is condemned in this penalty of death and corruption. But through the second man we trust that we can be freed, both now from the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and hereafter from all corruption of the flesh in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> resurrection:&mdash; as moreover we said to the aforesaid representatives; &#8216;We say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> died by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not from the substance of living, but from the quality of living. For, inasmuch as substance is one thing, and quality another, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did not so die as not to be, but so died as not to be blessed. Yet this same <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> returned afterwards to life through penitence.'</p>

<p>But that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> enters into the heart of man cannot be denied, if the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For it is there written, <em>And after the sop <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> entered into him</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse27">John 13:27</a></span>. And again it is therein also said, <em>When the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had now put himself into the heart of Judas, that Judas should betray Him</em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ibid. 2). He that denies this falls into Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Seeing then that, having examined the Ephesine synod, we found nothing of the kind to be contained therein, we caused to be brought to us also a very old Codex of the same synod from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ravenna, and we found it to agree with the report of the synod which we have so as to differ in no respect, and to contain nothing else in its decree of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> and rejection, except that they reject the twelve chapters of Cyril of blessed memory. But this whole argument we set forth much more fully and particularly to his representatives when they were with us, and most fully satisfied them. Wherefore lest either these or any like things should creep in yonder, so as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> offense to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, it is necessary for us to indicate these things to your Holiness. And, although we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Cyriacus to be <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, yet on account of others we ought to be cautious, that the seeds of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> may be trampled down before they spring up to public view.</p>

<p>I received the letters of your Holiness on the arrival here of our common son the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Sabinianus; but, as their bearer is already prepared for departure and cannot be detained, I will reply when the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, my <em>responsalis</em>, comes.</p>
