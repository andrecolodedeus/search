<h1>Book VII, Letter 39</h1>

<p> <em>To John, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to John, Bishop of Syracuse.</p>

<p>Lest attention to secular affairs should disjoin the hearts of religious men (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) from mutual charity, very earnest endeavour should be made to bring any matter that has come into dispute to the easiest possible termination. Since, then, from the information of C&aelig;sarius, abbot of St. Peter's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, constituted in a place called Baias, we find that between him and John, abbot of St. Lucia's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, constituted in the city of Syracuse, there has arisen a serious question about certain boundaries, we, lest this contention should be prolonged between them, have taken thought for their dispute being terminated by the determination of a land-measurer. And accordingly we have written to the <em>defensor</em> Fantinus, bidding him direct John the land-measurer, who has gone from Rome to Panormus, to resort to your Fraternity.</p>

<p>We exhort, therefore, that you go with him to the places about which there is contention, and, both parties having been brought together, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the places in dispute to have their boundaries defined in your presence, though still with a claim of prescription for forty years preserved to either party. But, whatever may be determined, let it be your Fraternity's anxious and studious care to have it so observed that no strife may henceforth be stirred up anew, nor any further complaint reach us.</p>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it is not unknown to your Fraternity that the venerable abbot C&aelig;sarius was formerly our friend; and therefore, saving equity, we commend him to you in all respects. And, seeing that he is entirely inexperienced in secular causes, it is needful for him to be aided by your solicitude; yet so that, in this as in all cases, you observe, as is fit, reason and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</p>
