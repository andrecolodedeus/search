<h1>Book VII, Letter 4</h1>

<p> <em>To Cyriacus, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Cyriacus, Bishop of Constantinople.</p>

<p>We have received with becoming charity our common sons, George the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and Theodore your <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>; and we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that you have passed from the care of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> business to the government of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, since, according to the voice of the Truth, <em>He that is faithful in a little will be faithful also in much</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse10">Luke 16:10</a></span>. And to the servant who administers well it is said, <em>Because you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse23">Matthew 25:23</a></span>; to whom also it is presently said further with respect to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> retribution, <em>Enter thou into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of your Lord.</em> Now you say in your letter that you had exceedingly wished for rest. But in this you show that you have fitly assumed pastoral responsibility, since, as a place of rule should be denied to those who <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> it, so it should be offered to those who fly from it. <em>And no man takes this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> unto himself, but he that is called of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse4">Hebrews 5:4</a></span>. And again the same excellent preacher says, <em>If one died far all, then all died; and Christ died for all. It remains that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 5:14-15</a></span>. And to the shepherd of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church it is said, <em>Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me? Feed My sheep</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse17">John 21:17</a></span>. From which words it appears that, if one who is able refuses to feed the sheep of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he shows that he does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the chief Shepherd. For if the Only-begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for accomplishing the good of all, came forth from the secrecy of the Father into the midst of us, what shall we say, if we prefer our secrecy to the good of our neighbours? Thus rest is to be desired by us with all our heart; and yet for the advantage of many it should sometimes be laid aside. For, as we ought with full desire to fly from occupation, so, if there should be a want of some one to preach, we must needs put a willing shoulder under the burden of occupation. And this we are taught by the conduct of two <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> , one of whom attempted to shun the office of preaching, while the other desired it. For to the Lord who sent him Jeremias replied saying, <em>Ah, Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I cannot speak; for I am a child</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse6">Jeremiah 1:6</a></span>. And when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> sought for some one to preach, saying, <em>Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?</em> Isaias offered himself of his own accord, saying, <em>Here am I, send me</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse8">Isaiah 6:8</a></span>. Lo, different voices proceeded outwardly from the two, but they flowed from the same fountain of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>For indeed there are two precepts of charity; to wit, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of one's neighbour. Wherefore Isaias, wishing to profit his neighbours by an active life, desires the office of preaching; but Jeremias, longing to cling assiduously to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of his Maker by a contemplative life, protests against being sent to preach. What, then, one laudably desired the other laudably shrunk from: the latter lest by speaking he should lose the gains of silent <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; the former lest by keeping silence he should feel the loss of diligent work. But this is nicely to be observed in both, that he who refused did not resist finally, and he who wished to be sent saw himself previously purged by a coal from the altar; that so no one who has not been purged should dare to approach sacred ministries, nor any one whom heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> chooses refuse proudly under a show of humility.</p>

<p>Moreover I find you in your epistles seeking with great longing after serenity of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and panting for tranquillity of thought apart from perturbation. But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not in what manner your Fraternity can attain to this. For one who has undertaken the pilotage of a ship must needs watch all the more as he further recedes from shore, so as sometimes to foresee from signs the coming storms; sometimes, when they come, either, if they are small, to ride over them in a straight course, or, if they swell violently, to avoid them as they rush on by steering sideways; and often to watch alone when all who are without charge of the ship are at rest. How, moreover, having undertaken the burden of pastoral charge, can you have serenity of thought, seeing that it is written, <em>Behold giants groan under the waters</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job026.htm#verse5">Job 26:5</a></span>? For, according to the words of John, <em>The waters are peoples</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rev017.htm#verse15">Revelation 17:15</a></span>. And the groaning of giants under the waters means that whoso in this world has increased in degree of power, as though in a sort of massive size of body, feels the load of greater tribulation by so much the more as he has taken on himself the care of ruling peoples. But, if the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> breathes upon the afflicted <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, immediately what was done bodily for the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> takes place with us spiritually. For it is written, <em>But the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse29">Exodus 14:29</a></span>. And through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> the Lord promises saying, <em>When you pass through the waters, I will be with you, and the rivers shall not overflow you</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse2">Isaiah 43:2</a></span>. For the rivers overflow those whom the active business of this world confounds with perturbation of mind. But he who is sustained in mind by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> passes through the waters, and yet is not overflowed by the rivers, because in the midst of crowds of peoples he so proceeds along his way as not to sink the head of his mind beneath the active business of the world.</p>

<p>I also, who, unworthy as I am, have come to a place of rule, had sometimes determined to seek some place of retirement: but, seeing the Divine counsels to be opposed to me, I submitted the neck of my heart to my Maker's yoke; especially reflecting on this, that no hidden places whatever can save the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this we observe sometimes, when even <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> go astray. For <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> was righteous in the depraved city itself, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> on the mountain <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm">Genesis 19</a></span>. But why speak of these instances, when we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of greater ones? For what is pleasanter than Paradise? What safer than <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>? And yet man out of Paradise, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven, by sinning fell. His power, then, should be sought, His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> implored, without whom we are nowhere without fault, with whom we are nowhere without righteousness. We should, then, take care that perturbation of thought get not the better of our minds; for it can by no means be entirely got rid of. For whosoever is in a place of rule must needs have to think sometimes even of earthly things, and to have a care also of external things, that the flock committed to him may be able to subsist for accomplishing what it has to do. But it should be most carefully seen to, that this same care pass not due measure, and that, when lawfully admitted into the heart, it be not allowed to become excessive. Whence it is rightly said through Ezekiel , <em>Let not the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; but polling let them poll their heads</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze044.htm#verse20">Ezekiel 44:20</a></span>. For what are hairs in the head by signification but thoughts in the mind? For, rising above the brain insensibly, they denote cares of the present life, which from negligent perception, since they come on sometimes importunely, advance as it were without our feeling them. Since, then, all who are over others ought indeed to have outward anxieties, and yet not to devote themselves to them exceedingly, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are rightly forbidden either to shave the head or to let their locks grow long, so that they may neither entirely cut off from themselves carnal thoughts for the life of their subjects, nor again allow them to grow too much. And it is also there well said, <em>Polling let them poll their heads;</em> meaning that the anxieties of a temporal charge should both proceed as far as is needful, and yet should be soon cut short, lest they grow to an immoderate length. While therefore both, through external provision administered, the life of bodies is protected, and again intentness of heart is not hindered through the same being immoderate, the hairs on the head of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> are kept to cover the skin, and cut short so as not to veil the eyes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we have received in full <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> your letters addressed to us, and give thanks to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, by the mutual confession of the faithful, guards the coat that is without seam woven from the top throughout, that is to say His Church, in the unity of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, from all rent of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; and against the deluge (so to speak) of so many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the perishing world constructs an ark of many planks in which the elect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> may be preserved unto life. For, when we in our turn send the confession of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to you, and you show your charity towards us, what are we doing in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church but smearing the ark with pitch; lest any wave of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> enter, and kill all the spiritual as being men, and the carnal as being beasts.</p>

<p>But, when you have wisely professed a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, it remains doubtless that you should keep the more warily the peace of hearts, because of what the Truth says, <em>Have <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> in yourselves, and have peace one with another</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse50">Mark 9:50</a></span>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle admonishes, saying, <em>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse3">Ephesians 4:3</a></span>. And again he says, <em>Follow peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, without which no man shall see God</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse14">Hebrews 12:14</a></span>. Which peace indeed you will then <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> have with us, if you turn away from the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of a profane name, according to what the same teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> says, <em>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane novelties of words</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1 Timothy 6:20</a></span>. For indeed it is too bad, if these who have been made preachers of humility should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the elation of a vain name, when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> preacher says, <em>But God forbid that I should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, save in the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians 6:14</a></span>. He then is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> who glories not in temporal power, but, for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, glories in His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>. Herein therefore we embrace you from the bottom of our heart, herein we recognize you as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, if, rejecting the vanity of words, you occupy the place of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> humility. For behold, we have been scandalized by this impious appellation, and retain in our mind and express in words by no means slight complaints. But your Fraternity <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how the Truth says, <em>If you offer your gift before the altar, and there rememberest that your brother has ought against you, leave there your gift, and go your way to be first reconciled to your brother, and then you shall come and offer your gift</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse23">Matthew 5:23-24</a></span>. Herein is to be considered, that, while every fault is done away by the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, so great is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of offense engendered in another's heart that from one who has so <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> the Lord accepts not the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> itself which is wont to do away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Take heed then with speed to wipe off <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of offense from your heart, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> may be able to regard as acceptable the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of your offering.</p>

<p>Furthermore, while you have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and accurately professed the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, we find that among those whom you have held to be condemned by the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> general synods you have condemned a certain Eudoxius; whose name we have not found mentioned in the Latin language either in synods or in the books of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of blessed memory, Epiphanius, Augustine, or Philaster, whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have been the chief disputants against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.  Now if any one of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Fathers really condemns him, we undoubtedly follow their opinion. If, however, in your synodical epistle you have wished to condemn by name those also who, apart from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synods, are condemned in the writings of the Fathers, your Fraternity has mentioned too few by many; but if those whom the general synods reject, then too many by this one. But in the midst of all these things it is to be remembered, that in order that we may be free to profess the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to order whatever has to be done in peace and concord, we ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> incessantly for the life of our most serene lords and of their offspring, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> would subdue barbarous nations under their feet, and grant them long and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> lives, to the end that through a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> empire the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in Christ may reign.</p>
