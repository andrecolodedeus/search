<h1>Book VII, Letter 40</h1>

<p> <em>To Eulogius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Eulogius, Bishop of Alexandria.</p>

<p>Your most sweet Holiness has spoken much in your letter to me about the chair of Saint Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, saying that he himself now sits on it in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of his successors. And indeed I acknowledge myself to be unworthy, not only in the dignity of such as preside, but even in the number of such as stand. But I gladly accepted all that has been said, in that he has spoken to me about Peter's chair who occupies Peter's chair. And, though special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to myself in no wise delights me, yet I greatly rejoiced because you, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones, have given to yourselves what you have bestowed upon me. For who can be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church has been made firm in the solidity of the Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who derived his name from the firmness of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so as to be called Petrus from <em>petra</em>. And to him it is said by the voice of the Truth, <em>To you I will give the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a></span>. And again it is said to him, <em>And when you are converted, strengthen your brethren</em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->xxii. 32). And once more, <em>Simon, son of Jonas, do you love Me? Feed my sheep</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse17">John 21:17</a></span>. Wherefore though there are many <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, yet with regard to the principality itself the See of the Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> alone has grown strong in authority, which in three places is the See of one.  For he himself exalted the See in which he deigned even to rest and end the present life. He himself adorned the See to which he sent his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> as <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>. He himself established the See in which, though he was to leave it, he sat for seven years. Since then it is the See of one, and one See, over which by Divine authority three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> now preside, whatever good I hear of you, this I impute to myself. If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything good of me, impute this to your merits, since we are one in Him Who says, <em>That they all may be one, as You, Father, art in me, and I in you that they also may be one in us</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse21">John 17:21</a></span>. Moreover, in paying you the debt of salutation which is due to you, I declare to you that I exult with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you labour assiduously against the barkings of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; and I implore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that He would aid your Blessedness with His protection, so as through your tongue to uproot every root of bitterness from the bosom of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, lest it should germinate again to the hindrance of many, and through it many should be defiled. For having received your talent you think on the injunction, <em>Trade till I come</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse13">Luke 19:13</a></span>. I therefore, though unable to trade at all nevertheless <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with you in the gains of your trade, inasmuch as I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that if operation does not make me partaker, yet charity does make me a partaker in your labour. For I reckon that the good of a neighbour is common to one that stands idle, if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in common in the doings of the other.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I have wished to send you some timber: but your Blessedness has not indicated whether you are in need of it: and we can send some of much larger size, but no ship is sent hither capable of containing it: and I think shame to send the smaller sort. Nevertheless let your Blessedness inform me by letter what I should do.</p>

<p>I have however sent you, as a small blessing from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Saint Peter who loves you, six of the smaller sort of Aquitanian cloaks (<em>pallia</em>), and two napkins (<em>oraria</em>); for, my affection being great, I presume on the acceptableness of even little things. For affection itself has its own worth, and it is quite certain that there will be no offense in what out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one has presumed to do.</p>

<p>Moreover I have received the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Evangelist Mark, according to the note appended to your letter. But, since I do not drink <em>colatum</em> and <em>viritheum</em> with pleasure, I venture to ask for <em>cognidium</em> , which last year, after a long interval, your Holiness caused to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in this city. For we here get from the traders the name of <em>cognidium</em>, but not the thing itself. Now I beg that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of your Holiness may support me against all the bitternesses which I suffer in this life, and defend me from them by your intercessions with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>.</p>
