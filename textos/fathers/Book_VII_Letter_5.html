<h1>Book VII, Letter 5</h1>

<p> <em>To Cyriacus, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Cyriacus, Bishop of Constantinople.</p>

<p>When in time past I represented the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> in the royal city, I became acquainted with the good qualities of your Holiness. And I greatly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> has been committed to you. And though unworthy, I beseech <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> with all the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in my power that He would even increase His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in you, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to gather gain of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> country. But, whereas you say that you are weak for this work that has been put upon you, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the first <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is acknowledgment of infirmity; and from this we gather that you can fulfil well the ministry you have undertaken, that we see how, out of humility, you acknowledge your own infirmity. For we are all infirm; but he is more infirm who has not strength to consider his infirmity. But you, most blessed brethren, are for this reason strong, that, distrusting your own strength, you trust in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, express by the words of a letter how much my heart is bound to your Charity. But I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> may by the gift of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> multiply the same charity that is between us, and may take away all occasion of offense, lest the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, united by the profession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and compacted by conjunction of the hearts of the faithful, should suffer any damage from <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> disputing with each other, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid. I at any rate, in all that I speak, in all that I say, against the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> conduct of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, still, through the bounty of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, never relinquish custody of inward charity; but so execute outwardly what belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> as by no means to disregard inwardly what belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and kindness. And do you also ever return my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and guard what belongs to peace and kindness; that, remaining of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so as to allow no dissension to come in between us, we may be better able from the very unity of our hearts to obtain what we seek from the Lord.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I commend to your Holiness John, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Chalcedon, and Athanasius of Isauria, that no one may set you against them by underhand misrepresentations; for I have thoroughly examined their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have found them sound in their confessions, which have also been given in writing.</p>

<p>Now may the Holy Trinity protect you with His hand, and render you always vigilant and careful in the custody of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, to the end that in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> retribution you may be counted worthy to be crowned, not only for your own work, but also for the amelioration of your subjects.</p>
