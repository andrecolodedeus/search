<h1>Book VII, Letter 6</h1>

<p> <em>To Mauricius Augustus.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Mauricius Augustus.</p>

<p>Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has made your Piety to be the guardian of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> peace, preserves you by the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which, through unity among <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, you preserve; and when you submit your heart humbly to the yoke of heavenly loving-kindness, it is brought to pass by heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that you tread your enemies under the foot of valour. For it cannot be of small advantage that, when John of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory had departed this life, your Piety long hesitated, and somewhat deferred the time, while seeking counsel in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order, to wit, that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of God might be ordered, as it should be, with great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.  Whence also I think that my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Cyriacus is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be exceedingly fit for pastoral rule, in that the long deliberation of your Piety has raised him to this degree. And we all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how diligent and how practised he has long been in the administration of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. Whence also I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that it has been brought about by Divine ordering that one who had administered the least things well should fitly undertake the greater, and should pass from the charge of affairs to the government of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Wherefore in all our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> we beseech <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> to repay this good work to the Serenity of our lords and to their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> offspring both in the present world and also with a perpetual recompense, and to grant to my aforesaid brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who has been put over the Lord's flock, to show himself fully solicitous in the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; that he may be able irreprovably both to correct what is wrong in his subjects and to foster what is right unto further increase; to the end that the judgment of your Piety concerning him may be approved, not only before men, but also before the eyes of the Supernal Majesty.</p>

<p>The venerable men, George the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and Theodore the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, in consideration of the command of my lords and the imminence of the winter season, I have not allowed to be delayed in this city.</p>
