<h1>Book VI, Letter 14</h1>

<p> <em>To the Count Narses</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Narses, etc.</p>

<p>Your Charity, being anxious to learn our opinion, has been at the pains of writing to us to ask what we think of the book against the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Athanasius which was sent to us. Having thoroughly perused some parts of it, we find that he has fallen into the dogma of Manich&aelig;us. But he who has noted some places as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> by a mark set against them slips also himself into Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; for he has marked certain places as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> which are Catholicly expressed and entirely <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. For when this is written; that when Adam <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> died, the writer shows afterwards how it is said to have died, namely that it lost the blessedness of its condition. Whosoever denies this is not a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. For God had said, <em>In the hour you eat thereof, in death you shall die</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse17">Genesis 2:17</a></span>. When, therefore, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> ate of the forbidden tree, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he did not die in the body, seeing that after this he begot children and lived many years. If, then, he did not die in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the impious conclusion follows that He himself lied who foretold that in the day that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> he should die. But it is to be understood that death takes place in two ways; either from ceasing to live, or with respect to the mode of living. When, then, man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is said to have died in the eating of the forbidden thing, it is meant, not in the sense of ceasing to live, but with regard to the mode of living;&mdash; that he should live afterwards in pain who had been created to live happily in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.  He, then, who has marked this passage in the book sent to me by my brother the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> is a Pelagian; for his view is evidently that of Pelagius, which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> plainly confutes in his epistles. The particular passages in his epistle I need not quote, as I write to one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. But Pelagius, who was condemned in the Ephesine synod, maintained this view with the intention of showing that we were redeemed by Christ unreally. For, if we did not through <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> die in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, we were redeemed unreally, which it were impious to say. Further, having examined the acts of the synod of Ephesus, we find nothing at all about Adelphius and Sava, and the others who are said to have been condemned there, and we think that, as the synod of Chalcedon was in one place falsified by the Constantinopolitan Church,  so something of the kind has been done with regard to the synod of Ephesus. Wherefore let your Charity make a thorough search for old copies of the acts of this synod, and thus see whether anything of the kind is found there, and send such copy as you may find to me, which I will return as soon as I have read it. For recent copies are not entirely to be trusted; and it is for this reason that I have been in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and have not wished as yet to reply in this case to my aforesaid brother the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John. Further, the Roman copies are much more correct than the Greek ones, since, as we have not your cleverness, so neither have we any impostures.</p>

<p>Now concerning the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> John, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his case has been decided in synod, whereby I have clearly ascertained that his adversaries have wished and long endeavoured to make him out a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, but have entirely failed.</p>

<p>Salute in my name your friends, who are ours: ours also, who are yours, salute you heartily through me. May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> protect you with His hand in the midst of so many thorns, that you may, unhurt, gather those flowers which the Lord has chosen.</p>
