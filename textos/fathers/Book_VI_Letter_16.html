<h1>Book VI, Letter 16</h1>

<p> <em>To Mauricius, Augustus.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Mauricius, etc.</p>

<p>Seeing that in you, most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> of princes, uncorrupt soundness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shines as a beam sent down from heaven, and that it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all that your Serenity embraces fervently and loves with entire devotion of heart the pure profession in which by God's favour you are powerful, we have perceived it to be very necessary to make request for those whom one and the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> enlightens, to the end that the Piety of our lords may protect them with its favour, and defend them from all molestation. When certain men scorn the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> they are shown to contradict the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For, since the Apostle declares that confession of the mouth is made unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, he who will not consent to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> a right profession accuses himself in rejecting others <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse10">Romans 10:10</a></span>.</p>

<p>Now all the proceedings against John, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the church of Chalcedon, having been read in council and considered in order, we have found that he has suffered the greater <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in that, when he declared and showed himself to be a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, it was not his guilt, but an uncertain accusation of long standing, that crushed him; and this to such an extent that his accusers declared in their open reply that they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionists</a> which they referred to. And, whereas they ought therefore to have been rejected from the very beginning of the trial, they were allowed, vague as they were, to remain in court for his accusation. But, lest at any rate alleged report might injure him, he produced a written confession of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with the purpose of showing evidently that he was a professor and follower of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>. But this the judges deputed by the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> John, our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> and unreasonably disregarded; and so, in doing all they could to put him down, showed themselves more to blame than he. For no one doubts that it is unfaithfulness not to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Seeing then that, everything having been thoroughly enquired into and considered, the decision of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Council with me, by the revealing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Divine power, has declared the above-written John the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and that no spot of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> pravity has been found in him, I entreat that the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> protection of your Serenity may order him to be kept unharmed from all annoyance, nor allow a professor of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to suffer any molestation. For not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> one who professes <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is not to purge <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but to make it. If this should be allowed, occasion of infidelity will arise, and people will themselves incur the guilt which they would correct unwarily.</p>

<p>These things therefore let the most Serene lord with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> precaution consider, and, as I have already requested, with profuse entreaties I again implore, that he allow not an innocent man to be afflicted anew as though he were guilty; to the end that Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who sees your Clemency <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and defend the purity of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rectitude, may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you both to rule over a pacified republic with your foes subdued, and to reign with His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>
