<h1>Book VI, Letter 27</h1>

<p> <em>To the Clergy and People of Jadera</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, nobles and people, dwelling at Jadera, and who have communicated with the prevaricator Maximus.</p>

<p>It has come to my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that some of you, deceived by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or under compulsion, have communicated with those who, their fault as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> requiring it, have been deprived of communion by the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, but that others, with wholesome discretion, have under the Lord's protection abstained; and as much as I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in those that have been constant so much do I groan for those who have gone astray, since they have partaken of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> communion, which have been granted to us by Divine loving-kindness for absolution, rather to the detriment of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. And because (as I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you) I earnestly and from the bottom of my heart sympathize will your Charity, I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> and entreat you with fatherly affection, that every one of you abstain from unlawful communion, and altogether shun those whom the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> does not receive into the fellowship of its communion, lest any one should stand guilty in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Judge from that whereby he might have been saved.</p>

<p>Moreover I have discovered that certain men of perverse mind in your parts have tried to insinuate that I am moved against Maximus by some grudge, and that I desire to carry out not what is canonical, but what <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> dictates. But far, far be this from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that it should be moved in any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by private animosity. But as for me, it is as taking thought for the people dwelling in those parts and for my own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and as fearing the judgment of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I wish to have the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this Maximus enquired into, and, God showing me the way, to decide canonically. Now, inasmuch as I have written to him frequently that he was not to celebrate the sacred solemnities of mass until I had been able to obtain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his case, he would in any case be deprived of communion; and now his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is openly shown from this&mdash;that, having (as I have said) been often admonished to come to us, under various excuses he refuses, he shuns, he fears coming. What then is he afraid of, if his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> does not accuse him with regard to the things that have been said? Since then you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things, now that you can make no excuse on the plea of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, I beseech, I exhort, I warn you, that you altogether refrain from fellowship with forbidden communion, and that not one of you presume, against his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to communicate with any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who communicates with the above written Maximus.</p>

<p>Since however I hear, as I have said before, that some of you fell in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and that some were even driven by force to communicate, I implore the Almighty Lord, that He would keep with His perpetual protection, and answer with His wished for bounty, those who have given no assent to this iniquity; and as to those whom either party spirit, or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> soever, has drawn into a fault, that He would absolve them from all guilt of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and from all implication in the liability of others, and both give them all the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His protection in the present life, and grant to me to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> for them in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> country. Wherefore, that this intercession may avail for you with God our Saviour, show <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to our exhortations for the good of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and receive the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> communion from those whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have abstained, and to abstain still, from communion with the aforesaid Maximus.</p>
