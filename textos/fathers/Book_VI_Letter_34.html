<h1>Book VI, Letter 34</h1>

<p> <em>To Castorius, Notary.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Castorius, our notary at Ravenna.</p>

<p>When Florentinus, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ravenna, treated with us in behalf of our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Marinianus concerning the use of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, on our asking him what was the ancient custom, he replied that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ravenna used the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> in all litanies.  But that this was not so we both learned from others, and it appeared evidently from the letters of the former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John, which we showed to him. But he said what he had been ordered to say. For, at the time when this same John was inhibited by you from presuming to use the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> out of order and unadvisedly, he wrote to us that the ancient custom had been this; that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city should use the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> in solemn litanies. We send you, for your information, copies of his letters. But when Adeodatus, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the aforesaid Church, at the time when he was here, in like manner pressed us strongly concerning this use of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, we, desiring to ascertain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in like manner had him questioned as to what the custom was: and he, that he might persuade us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him, and succeed in obtaining from us what he sought, testified under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that it had been the ancient custom for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his city to use the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> in four or five solemn litanies. Let therefore your Experience look to the matter diligently, and enquire with all carefulness how many solemn litanies there have been from ancient times. Take care also to make enquiry by calling them, not the solemn, but the greater litanies; that when, through what the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Adeodatus testified to us and what the letter of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John acknowledges, it shall appear how many of these solemn litanies there were, we, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how often the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> used to be worn in litanies, may most willingly grant the privilege. But do not make this enquiry of those who are put forward by the ecclesiastics, but of others whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be impartial: and whatever after careful investigation you discover communicate to us with accuracy, that having ascertained the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as we have said, we may relieve the mind of our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the most reverend Marinianus.</p>
