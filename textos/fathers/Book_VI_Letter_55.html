<h1>Book VI, Letter 55</h1>

<p> <em>To Protasius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Protasius, Bishop of Aqu&aelig; in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> (<em>Aix</em>).</p>

<p>How great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, distinguishes you is evident, not only from the prerogative of your office, but also from the devotion you bestow on what is to the advantage of his Church. And having learned that this is the case from the relation of Augustine, servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the bearer of these presents, we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> exceedingly for the affection and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that is in you; and we give thanks that, though absent in the body, you still show that you are with us in heart and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, seeing that you exhibit brotherly charity towards us, as is fit. In order then that actual fact may confirm the good report of you, tell our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Virgilius to hand over to us the payments which his predecessor received for many years and retained in his own hands: for it is the property of the poor. And if perchance, as we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> will be the case, he should desire in any way to excuse himself, do you, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> more exactly, inasmuch as you acted as steward (<em>vicedominus</em>) at that time, explain to him how the matter stands, and urge him not to retain in his hands the property of Saint Peter and of his poor. But, though perhaps our men may not need this, do not refuse your testimony in the case; that so, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as well as to the devotion of your good will, the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, for whose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you do this, may respond to you by his intercession both here and in the life to come. We heartily commend to your Holiness the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Candidus, our common son, to whom we have committed the charge of this patrimony.</p>
