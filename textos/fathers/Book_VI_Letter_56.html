<h1>Book VI, Letter 56</h1>

<p> <em>To Stephen, Abbot</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Stephen, etc.</p>

<p>The account given us by Augustine, servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the bearer of these presents, has made us joyful, in that he has told us that your Love is vigilant as you ought to be; and he further affirms that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and the whole congregation live in unanimity and concord. And, since the goodness of presidents is the salutary rule of their subjects, we implore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> to enkindle you always in good works by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His loving-kindness, and to keep those who are committed to you from all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of diabolical deceit, and grant to them to live with you in charity and in the manner of life that pleases Him.</p>

<p>But, since the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> never rests from plotting against our doings, so as to deceive in some part <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, most beloved son, we exhort you to exercise vigilantly your anxious care, and so to keep those who are committed to you by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and heedfulness that the prowling wolf may find no opportunity for tearing the flock: to the end that, when you shall have rendered to our God unharmed those of whom you have undertaken the charge, He may both of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> repay you with rewards for your labour and multiply in you longings for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<p> We have received the spoons and plates which you have sent us, and we thank your Charity, because you have shown how you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the poor in having sent for their use such things as they need.</p>
