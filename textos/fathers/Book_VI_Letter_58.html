<h1>Book VI, Letter 58</h1>

<p> <em>To Theodoric and Theodebert</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Theodoric and Theodebert, brethren, Kings of the Franks. <em>A paribus</em>. </p>

<p>Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> has adorned your kingdom with rectitude of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and has made it conspicuous among other nations by the purity of its <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, we have conceived great expectations of you, that you will by all means desire that your subjects should be converted to that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in virtue of which you are their kings and lords. This being so, it has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that the nation of the Angli is desirous, through the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of being converted to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in their neighbourhood neglect them, and are remiss in kindling their desires by their own exhortations. On this account therefore we have taken thought to send to them the servant of God Augustine, the bearer of these presents, whose <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and earnestness are well known to us, with other servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And we have also charged them to take with them some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from the neighbouring parts, with whom they may be able to ascertain the disposition of the Angli, and, as far as God may grant it to them, to aid their wishes by their admonition. Now, that they may have it in their power to show themselves efficient and capable in this business, we beseech your Excellency, greeting you with paternal charity, that these whom we have sent may be counted worthy to find the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of your favour. And, since it is a matter of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, let your power protect and aid them; that Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that with devout mind and with all your heart you take an interest in His <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, may propitiously direct your causes, and after earthly dominion bring you to heavenly kingdoms.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we request your Excellency to hold as commended to you our most beloved son, Candidus, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and the rector of the patrimony of our Church, to the end that the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, may answer you by his intercession, while, looking to the reward, you afford your protection in the concerns of his poor.</p>
