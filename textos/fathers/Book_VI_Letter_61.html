<h1>Book VI, Letter 61</h1>

<p> <em>To Castorius, Notary</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Castorius, etc.</p>

<p>The magnificent lord Andreas presses me continually about restoring the use of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ravenna according to ancient custom. And you know that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John wrote to me that it had been the custom for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the said Church to use the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> in solemn litanies.  Adeodatus, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of that church, when he besought me earnestly on the same subject, satisfied me by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the said place were accustomed to use the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> in litanies four times in the year. But the aforesaid lord Andreas says in his letters that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ravenna was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of using the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> in litanies at all times except in Lent. And these litanies, which he does not blush to say were daily, he asserts to be solemn ones. Whence I have been altogether astonished. But let your Experience regard no man's person, no man's words; keep the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and rectitude only before your eyes, and enquire of senior <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and of the Archdeacon of that same Church, who would not, I think, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjure</a> himself for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of another, and of others of older standing who had been in sacred orders before the times of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John, or if there are any others of riper age not in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders; and let them come before the body of Saint <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, and touching his sepulchre <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> what had been the custom before the times of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John; since, as you know, he was a man who presumed greatly and endeavoured in his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to arrogate many things to himself. And whatever may be <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> to by faithful and grave men, according to the subjoined form, we desire to be retained in the same Church. But see that thou act not negligently, and that no one corrupt your faithfulness and devotion in this matter; for your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Act assiduously, yet so that the aforesaid Church be not lowered in a way contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but that it retain the usage that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the times of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John. Moreover, for satisfying yourself, do not enquire of two or three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but of as many as you can find of old standing and grave character, that so we may neither deny to that Church what has been of ancient custom, nor concede to it what has been <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> and attempted newly. But do all kindly and sweetly, so that both your action may be strict and your tongue gentle. The sword  which has been left at Ravenna, as we have already written, bring hither with you; and carefully attend to what our son Boniface the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and the magnificent Maurentius the <em>chartularius</em> have written to you about.</p>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the inseparable Trinity of Divine Power, and by this body of the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, that out of favour to no person, and without any advantage to myself intervening, I give my testimony. But this I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and am personally cognizant of, that, before the times of the late <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John, the Bishop of Ravenna, in the presence of this or that <em>apocrisiarius</em> of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, on such and such days, had the custom of using the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, and I am not aware that he had herein usurped latently, or in the absence of the <em>apocrisiarius.</em></p>
