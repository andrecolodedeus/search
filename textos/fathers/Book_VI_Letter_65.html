<h1>Book VI, Letter 65</h1>

<p> <em>To Mauricius, Emperor.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Mauricius Augustus.</p>

<p>Amidst the cares of warfare and innumerable anxieties which you sustain in your unwearied <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the government of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> republic, it is a great <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to me along with the whole world that your Piety ever watches over custody of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby the empire of our lords is resplendent. Whence I fully trust that, as you guard the causes of God with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of a religious <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so God guards and aids yours with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His Majesty. Now after what manner the serenity of your Piety, out of regard to righteousness and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the purest religion, has been moved against the most flagitious pravity of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, the tenor of the commands which you have sent most clearly shows. But the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have come from the African province assert that these have been so disregarded through ill-advised connivance that neither is the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> held in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> there, nor are the imperial commands so far carried into effect; adding also this: that in the aforesaid province, through the <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> prevailing, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is publicly let to sale. But on the other hand the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Gennadius  has likewise complained of one of those who made such complaints: and two others also have borne like testimony with him on the subject. But, inasmuch as in this case a secular judge was concerned, I have thought it right to send these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the footsteps of your Piety, that they may represent in person to your most serene ears what they declare themselves to have endured for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>For these reasons I beseech the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of my lords, for the good of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and life of their most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> offspring, to give orders by a strict mandate for the punishment of such as you find to be such as have been described, and to arrest with the hand of rescue the ruin of those who are perishing, and to apply the medicine of correction to insane minds, and cure them of the poisonous bite of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; that so, the darkness of pestiferous pravity having been driven away by the remedy of your provision, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> having shed abroad in those parts the rays of its serenity, heavenly triumph may await you before the eyes of our Redeemer, because whomsoever you defend outwardly from the enemy, them you also set free inwardly from the poison of diabolical fraud; which is a still more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> thing.</p>
