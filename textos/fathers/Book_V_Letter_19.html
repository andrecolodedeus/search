<h1>Book V, Letter 19</h1>

<p> <em>To Sabinianus, Deacon</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Sabinianus, etc.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our brother the most reverend John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, I have been unwilling to write two letters. But one I have drawn up briefly, which may seem to combine both requisites; that is to say, both honesty and kindness.</p>

<p>Let therefore your Love take care to give him this letter which I have now addressed to him in compliance with the wish of the Emperor. For in the sequel another will be sent him such as his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> will not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in. For he has come even to this; that, taking occasion of the case of John the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, he transmitted hither the acts, wherein almost in every line he called himself <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F30;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F78;&#x03BD;</span> (<em>&oelig;cumenical</em>) patriarch. But I hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that the Supernal Majesty will confound his hypocrisy. But I wonder how he could so deceive your Love as that you should allow the lord Emperor to be persuaded to write to me himself concerning this matter, admonishing me to have peace with him. For, if the lord Emperor wishes to observe <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, he ought to have admonished him to refrain from the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> title, and then at once there would be peace between us. I suspect, however, that you have not all considered with what cunningness this has been done by our aforesaid brother John. For it is for this purpose that he has done it; that the lord Emperor might be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, and so he himself might seem to be confirmed in his vanity, or that I might not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him, and so his mind might be irritated against me. But we will keep to the right way, fearing nothing in this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> except the Almighty Lord. Wherefore let your Love be in nothing afraid. All things that you see to be lofty in this world against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> despise; trust in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the help of the blessed Apostle Peter. Remember the voice of the Truth, which says, <em>Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse4">1 John 4:4</a></span>; and in this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatever has to be done, do it with the utmost authority. For now that we can in no way be protected from the swords of our enemies, now that for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the republic we have lost silver, gold, slaves and clothing, it is too ignominious that through those men we should lose even the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For to assent to that atrocious title is nothing else than to lose the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Wherefore, as I have written to you already in former letters, never do thou presume to proceed with him. </p>
