<h1>Book V, Letter 20</h1>

<p> <em>To Mauricius Augustus.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Mauricius, etc.</p>

<p>Our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and God-appointed lord, among his other august cares and burdens, watches also in the uprightness of spiritual <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> over the preservation of peace among the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, inasmuch as he piously and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> considers that no one can govern earthly things aright unless he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to deal with divine things, and that the peace of the republic hangs on the peace of the universal Church. For, most serene Lord, what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power, and what strength of fleshly arm would presume to lift irreligious hands against the lofty height of your most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Empire, if the concordant hearts of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were studious to implore their Redeemer for you with the tongue, and also, as they ought to do, by their deservings? Or what sword of a most savage race would advance with so great cruelty to the slaughter of the faithful, unless the life of us, who are called <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> but are not, were weighed down by works most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. But while we neglect the things that concern us, and think of those that concern us not, we associate our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with the barbaric forces and our fault, which weighs down the forces of the republic, sharpens the swords of the enemy. But what shall we say for ourselves, who press down the people of God which we are unworthily set over with the loads of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; who destroy by example what we preach with the tongue; who by our works teach unrighteous things, and with our voice only set forth the things that are righteous? Our bones are worn down by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, and in our mind we swell. Our body is covered with vile raiment, and in elation of heart we surpass the purple. We lie in ashes, and look down upon loftiness. Teachers of humility, we are chiefs of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; behind the faces of sheep we hide the teeth of wolves.  But what is the end of these things except that we persuade men, but are manifest to God? Wherefore most providently for restraining warlike movements does the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord seek the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and, for compacting it, deigns to bring back the hearts of its <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to concord. And this indeed is what I wish; and, as far as I am concerned, I render <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to his most serene commands. But since it is not my <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but God's, since the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, since the venerable synods, since the very commands of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> are disturbed by the invention of a certain <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and pompous phrase, let the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord cut the place of the sore, and bind the resisting patient in the chains of august authority. For in binding up these things tightly you relieve the republic; and while you cut off such things, you provide for the lengthening of your reign.</p>

<p>For to all who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> it is apparent that by the Lord's voice the care of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was committed to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostle and Prince of all the Apostles, Peter. For to him it is said, <em>Peter, do you love Me? Feed My sheep</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse17">John 21:17</a></span>. To him it is said, <em>Behold <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> has desired to sift you as wheat; and I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for you, Peter, that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not. And thou, when you are converted, strengthen your brethren</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse31">Luke 22:31</a></span>. To him it is said, <em>You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto you the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> and whatsoever you shall bind an earth shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed also in heaven</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew 16:18</a></span>.</p>

<p>Lo, he received the keys of the heavenly kingdom, and power to bind and loose is given him, the care and principality of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is committed to him, and yet he is not called the universal apostle; while the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, my fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> John, attempts to be called universal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. I am compelled to cry out and say, <em>O tempora, O mores!</em></p>

<p>Lo, all things in the regions of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> are given up into the power of barbarians, cities are destroyed, camps overthrown, provinces depopulated, no cultivator inhabits the land, worshippers of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> rage and dominate daily for the slaughter of the faithful, and yet <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who ought to lie weeping on the ground and in ashes, seek for themselves names of vanity, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in new and profane titles.</p>

<p>Do I in this matter, most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord, defend my own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>? Do I resent my own special wrong? Nay, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the Universal Church.</p>

<p>Who is this that, against the evangelical ordinances, against the decrees of canons, presumes to usurp to himself a new name? Would indeed that one by himself he were, if he could be without any lessening of others&mdash;he that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> to be universal.</p>

<p>And certainly we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Constantinopolitan Church have fallen into the whirlpool of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and have become not only <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but even heresiarchs. For thence came <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, who, thinking <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men, to be two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, because he did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God could be made man, broke out even into Jewish perfidy. Thence came Macedonius, who denied that God the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was consubstantial with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. If then any one in that Church takes to himself that name, whereby he makes himself the head of all the good, it follows that the Universal Church falls from its standing (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid), when he who is called Universal falls. But far from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> hearts be that name of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> is taken away, while it is madly arrogated to himself by one.</p>

<p>Certainly, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, it was offered by the venerable synod of Chalcedon to the Roman pontiff.  But none of them has ever consented to use this name of singularity, lest, by something being given peculiarly to one, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in general should be deprived of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to them. How is it then that we do not seek the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of this title even when offered, and another presumes to seize it for himself though not offered?</p>

<p>He, then, is rather to be bent by the mandate of our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Lords, who scorns to render <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to canonical injunctions. He is to be coerced, who does wrong to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Universal Church, who swells in heart, who <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> rejoicing in a name of singularity, who also puts himself above the dignity of your Empire through a title peculiar to himself.</p>

<p>Behold, we all suffer offense for this thing. Let then the author of the offense be brought back to a right way of life; and all quarrels of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> will cease. For I for my part am the servant of all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, so long as they live as becomes <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. For whosoever, through the swelling of vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, lifts up his neck against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> and against the statutes of the Fathers, I trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that he will not bend my neck to himself, not even with swords.</p>

<p>Moreover what has been done in this city on our hearing of this title, I have indicated in full to my <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <em>responsalis</em> Sabinianus. Let then the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of my lords think of me as their own, whom they have always cherished and countenanced beyond others, and who desire to render <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to you and yet <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to be found guilty in the heavenly and tremendous judgment, and, according to the petition of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Sabinianus, let my most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord either deign to judge this business, or to move the often before mentioned man to desist at length from this attempt. If then through the most just judgment of your Piety he should comply with your orders, even though they be mild ones, we shall return thanks to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> for the peace granted through you to all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But should he persist any longer in his present contention, we hold this sentence of the Truth to be already made good; <em>Every one that exalts himself shall be humbled</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse11">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse14">18:14</a></span>. And again it is written, <em>Before a fall the heart is lifted up</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse18">Proverbs 16:18</a></span>. I however, rendering <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the commands of my lords, have both written sweetly to my aforesaid fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and humbly admonished him to amend himself of this <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> of empty <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. If therefore he be willing to hear me, he has a devoted brother. But, if he persists in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, I already see what will follow:&mdash; that he will find Him as his adversary of whom it is written, <em>God resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, but gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James 4:6</a></span>.</p>
