<h1>Book V, Letter 21</h1>

<p> <em>To Constantina Augusta</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Constantina, etc.</p>

<p>Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who holds in His right hand the heart of your Piety, both protects us through you and prepares for you rewards of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> remuneration for temporal <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. For I have learned from the letters of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Sabinianus my <em>responsalis</em> with what <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> your Serenity is interested in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the blessed Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> Peter against certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are proudly <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and feignedly kind. And I trust in the bounty of our Redeemer that for these your good offices with the most serene lord and his most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sons you will receive retribution also in the heavenly country. Nor is there any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that you will receive <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> benefits, being loosed from the chains of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his Church you have made him your debtor to whom the power of binding and of loosing has been given. Wherefore I still beg you to allow no man's hypocrisy to prevail against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since there are some who, according to the saying of the excellent preacher, by sweet words and fair speeches seduce the hearts of the innocent&mdash;men who are vile in raiment, but puffed up in heart. And they affect to despise all things in this world, and yet seek to acquire for themselves all the things that are of this world. They confess themselves unworthy before all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but cannot be content with private titles, since they <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> that whereby they may seem to be more worthy than all. Let therefore your Piety, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> has appointed with our most serene Lord to be over the whole world, through your favouring of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> render service to Him from whom you have received your right to so great a dominion, that you may rule over the world that is committed to you so much the more securely as you more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> serve the Author of all things in the execution of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I inform you that I have received a letter from the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord desiring me to be pacific towards my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> John. And indeed so it became the religious lord to give injunctions to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. But, when this my brother with new presumption and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> calls himself universal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, having caused himself in the time of our predecessor of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory to be designated in synod by this so <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> a title, though all the acts of that synod were abrogated, being disallowed by the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>&mdash;the most serene lord gives me a somewhat distressing intimation, in that he has not rebuked him who is acting proudly, but endeavours to bend me from my purpose, who in this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of defending the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and Canons, of humility and rectitude; whereas my aforesaid brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is acting against evangelical principles and also against the blessed Apostle Peter, and against all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and against the ordinances of the Canons. But the Lord, in whose hands are all things, is almighty; of Him it is written, <em>There is no wisdom nor <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> nor counsel against the Lord</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse30">Proverbs 21:30</a></span>. And indeed my often before mentioned most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother endeavours to persuade my most serene lord of many things: but well I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all those <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of his and all those tears will not allow my lord to be in any thing cajoled by any one against reason or his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>Still it is very distressing, and hard to be borne with patience, that my aforesaid brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, despising all others, should attempt to be called sole <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But in this <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of his what else is denoted than that the times of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> are already near at hand? For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he is imitating him who, scorning social <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> with the legions of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, attempted to start up to a summit of singular eminence, saying, <em>I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven, I will sit upon the mount of the testament, in the sides of the North, and will ascend above the heights of the clouds, and I will be like the most High</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse13">Isaiah 14:13</a></span>. Wherefore I beseech you by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> not to allow the times of your Piety to be polluted by the elation of one man, nor in any way to give any assent to so perverse a title, and that in this case your Piety may by no means despise me; since, though the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of Gregory are so great that he ought to suffer such things, yet there are no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the Apostle Peter that he should deserve in your times to suffer thus. Wherefore again and again I beseech you by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that, as the princes your ancestors have sought the favour of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostle Peter, so you also take heed both to seek it for yourselves and to keep it, and that his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> among you be in no degree lessened on account of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> who unworthily serve him, seeing that he is able both to be your helper now in all things and hereafter to remit your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is now even seven years that we have been living in this city among the swords of the Lombards. How much is expended on them daily by this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that we may be able to live among them, is not to be told. But I briefly indicate that, as in the regions of Ravenna the Piety of my Lords has for the first army of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> a treasurer (<em>sacellarium</em>) to defray the daily expenses for recurring needs, so I also in this city am their treasurer for such purposes. And yet this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which at one and the same time unceasingly expends so much on <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the people, and in addition on the Lombards, lo it is still pressed down by the affliction of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, which groan much for this <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of one man, though they do not presume to say anything.</p>

<p>Further, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Salona has been ordained without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of me and my <em>responsalis</em>, and a thing has been done which never happened under any former princes. When I heard of this, I at once sent word to that prevaricator, who had been irregularly ordained, that he must not presume by any means to celebrate the solemnities of mass, unless we should have first ascertained from our most serene lords that they had ordered this to be done; and this I commanded him under pain of excommunication. And yet, scorning and despising me, supported by the audacity of certain secular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, to whom he is said to give many <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a> so as to impoverish his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he presumes up to this time to celebrate mass, and has refused to come to me according to the order of my lords. Now I, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the injunction of their Piety, have from my heart forgiven this same Maximus, who had been ordained without my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, his presumption in passing over me and my <em>responsalis</em> in his ordination, even as though he had been ordained with my authority. But his other wrong doings&mdash; to wit his bodily transgressions, which I have heard of, and his having been elected through <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribery</a>, and his having presumed to celebrate mass while <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>&mdash; these things, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I cannot pass over without enquiry. But I hope, and implore the Lord, that no fault may be found in him with respect to these things that are reported, and that his case may be terminated without peril to my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Nevertheless, before this has been ascertained, my most serene lord, in the order that has been dispatched, has enjoined me to receive him with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> when he comes. And it is a very serious thing that a man of whom so many things of such a nature are reported should be honoured before such things have been enquired into and sifted, as they ought in the first place to be. And, if the causes of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are committed to me are settled before my most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lords under the patronage of others, what shall I do, unhappy that I am, in this Church? But that my <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> despise me, and have recourse to secular Judges against me, I give thanks to Almighty God that I attribute it to my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. This however I briefly intimate, because I am waiting for a little while; and, if he should long delay coming to me, I shall in no wise hesitate to exercise strict canonical discipline in his case. But I trust in Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He will give long life to our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Lords, and order things for us under your hand, not according to our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but according to the gifts of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. These things, then, I suggest to my most tranquil lady, since I am not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> with how great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for rectitude the most pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of her Serenity is moved.</p>
