<h1>Book V, Letter 30</h1>

<p> <em>To Mauricius Augustus.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Mauricius, etc.</p>

<p>The Piety of my Lords, which has been wont mercifully to sustain your servants, has shone forth here in so kind a supply that the need of all the feeble has been relieved by the succour of your bounty. On this account we all with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and tears beseech Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has moved the heart of your Clemency to do this thing, that He would preserve the empire of our Lords safe in His unfailing <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and by the aid of His own majesty extend their victories in all nations. The thirty pounds of gold which my fellow-servant Busa brought, Scribo  has distributed faithfully to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in need, and others. And, since certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> devoted to a religious life (<em>sanctimoniales f&oelig;min&aelig;</em>) have come to this city from various provinces, having fled hither after captivity, of whom some, so far as there was room for them, have been placed in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but others, who could not be taken in, lead a life of singular destitution, it has been thought good that what could be spared from the relief of the blind, maimed and feeble should be distributed to them, so that not only needy natives, but also strangers who arrive here, might receive of the compassion of our Lords. Hence it has been brought about that all alike with one accord <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the life of our lords, that so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> may give you a long and quiet life, and grant to the most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> offspring of your Piety to flourish long in the Roman republic. The pay also of the soldiers has been so distributed by my aforesaid fellow-servant Scribo , in the presence also of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Castus, <em>magister militum</em>, that all received with thanks the gifts of our lords under due discipline, and abstained from all murmuring such as was formerly wont to prevail among them.</p>
