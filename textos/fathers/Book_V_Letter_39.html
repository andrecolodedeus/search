<h1>Book V, Letter 39</h1>

<p> <em>To Anastasius, Bishop</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Anastasius, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse14">Luke 2:14</a></span>, because that great river which once had left the rocks of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> dry has returned at length to its proper channel, and waters the subject valleys that are near, so as also to bring forth fruit, some thirty-fold, some sixty-fold, and some an hundred-fold. For now there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that many flowers of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are growing up in its valleys, and that they will come even to ripe fruit through the streams of your tongue. Wherefore with voice of heart and mouth from our inmost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> we render due praise to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in your Blessedness, not with you only, but with all who are subject to you. I have received the letters of your Holiness, to me most sweet and pleasant, while we ourselves, if I may so speak, are sweating under the same toil with you. And indeed I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how heavy must be to you the burden of external cares after those heights of rest, wherein with the hand of the heart you were touching heavenly secrets. But remember that you rule an <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and assuagest sorrow the more readily from being made all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. In the Books of Kings, as your accomplished Holiness <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, a certain man is described who used either hand for the right hand <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ch012.htm#verse2">1 Chronicles 12:2</a></span>. And, with regard to this, I am not doubtful about the lord Anastasius, of old my most sweet and most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patron, that, while he draws earthly works to heavenly profit, he turns the left hand to the right hand's use; so that his heavenly intentness may accomplish its work, so to speak, with the right hand, and also, when he is led in his care of temporal things towards the interests of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the left hand may acquire the strength of the right.</p>

<p>And indeed these things cannot be without heavy labour and trouble. But let us remember the labours of those who went before us; and what we endure will not be hard. For <em>We must through many tribulations enter into the kingdom of God</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act014.htm#verse22">Acts 14:22</a></span>. And, <em>We were pressed out of measure, yea and above strength, insomuch that we were weary even of life. But we ourselves, too, had the answer of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse8">2 Corinthians 1:8-9</a></span>. And yet <em>The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the supervening <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which shall be revealed in us</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans 8:18</a></span>. How then can we that are weak sheep pass without labour through the heat of this world wherein we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that even rams have suffered under heavy toil?</p>

<p>Further, what tribulations I suffer in this land from the swords of the Lombards, from the iniquities of judges, from the press of business, from the care of subjects, and also from bodily affliction, I am unable to express either by pen or tongue. Concerning which things even though I might say something briefly, I hesitate, lest to your most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Charity, while afflicted by your own tribulations, I should add mine also. But may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> both in the abundance of His loving-kindness fill the mind of your most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Blessedness with all comfort, and grant at some time, on account of your intercession, to unworthy me to rest from these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which I suffer. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Grace. These words, as you see, taken from what you had written, I insert in my epistles, that your Blessedness may perceive with regard to <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Saint Ignatius</a> that he is not only yours, but also ours.  For, as we have his master, the Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in common, so also no one of us ought to have to himself alone the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of this same Prince.  Moreover, we have received your blessing , which is of sweet smell and of a good savour, with the feelings that were due to it. And we give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that what you do, what you say, and what you give, is fragrant and savoury. For your life therefore let us say together, let us say all, <em>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will.</em></p>
