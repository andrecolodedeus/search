<h1>Book V, Letter 4</h1>

<p> <em>To Constantius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Constantius, Bishop of Mediolanum (<em>Milan</em>).</p>

<p>If licence to be restored to their rank be granted to the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, the force of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline is undoubtedly broken, while in the hope of restoration each person fears not to give way to his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> inclinations. Your Fraternity, for instance, has consulted us as to whether Amandinus, ex-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and ex-abbot, who was deposed by your predecessor for fault requiring it, should be called back to his rank; which thing is not allowable; and we decree that it cannot on any account be done. Yet, if it should be the case that his manner of life deserves it, seeing that he has been deprived altogether of his sacred office, assign him a place in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, as you may see fit, before other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Above all things, then, take care that no one's supplication persuade you in any way to restore the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> to their sacred orders, lest such punishment should be supposed not to be definitely ordained for them, but only a temporary expedient.</p>

<p>As to Vitalianus the ex-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, about whom you write that he should be strictly guarded, we will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> him to be sent into <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, that, being deprived of all hope of departure thence, he may then at least constrain himself to penitential bewailing. Jobinus also, of Portus Veneris, once <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and abbot, we have decreed to be deprived of his office, and written that another should be ordained in his place. In like manner also we decree that the three subdeacons, whom your Fraternity has notified to us as having lapsed, shall ever cease from and stand deprived of their office, and that nothing beyond lay communion be allowed them. Further, we have adjudged the ex-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Saturninus to give security that he will not ever presume to approach the ministry of his sacred order. And we desire him to remain, with deprivation of his sacred order, in the same island in which he was, permitting him to have and exercise care and solicitude with respect to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; for we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, his lapse having made him more wary, he will now the more carefully keep guard over those who are committed to him.</p>

<p>Further, concerning John, notary of your church, the charity wherewith we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you and have long loved you warns us to write, lest you should order anything with regard to him while you are still provoked by his fault. Guarding, then, against this, enquire fully by all means in your power into the possessions of your church; by which means neither may you offend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor may he be able to find a ground for accusing you before men. For we write, not as defending John or commending him personally without reason, but lest your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be in any way burdened with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> under the incitement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Whence it is needful, as we have before said, that you should by no means neglect to enquire, in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with a full investigation into the possessions of your church.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the epistle of your most dear Fraternity has caused us to wonder much with respect to the person of Fortunatus.  But either that letter was not dictated by you, or certainly, if it is yours, we by no means recognize in it our brother the lord Constantius. For you ought to have paid, and still ought to pay, attention to the fact that it is in behalf of your <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> that we write. For, when he asserts that he suffers wrong among you, and has been unable to procure the guardian's (<em>defensoris</em>) aid, what else does he intimate but ill-will on your part? Wherefore, that neither this affair may dim your <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> in some quarters nor damage possibly ensue in any way with good <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to your church, you ought to send hither a person instructed by you, that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the case may be examined, and the matter terminated, without ill-will on your part. And for this reason especially, that if, after his complaint, sentence should be pronounced among yourselves in your favour, he will be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been defeated, not reasonably, but by power alone. But we, out of the charity wherewith we are bound to you, desist not from admonishing you to do what will be for your good repute, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that, though this exhortation saddens you for the time, it will afterwards <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, when the animosity of contention has passed away. In the month of September, Indiction 13. (In Vatic. <em>The month of December, Indict.</em> 13.)</p>
