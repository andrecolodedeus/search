<h1>Book V, Letter 40</h1>

<p> <em>To Mauricius Augustus.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Mauricius, etc.</p>

<p>The Piety of my Lords in their most serene commands, while set on refuting me on certain matters, in sparing me has by no means spared me. For by the use therein of the term simplicity they politely call me silly. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> indeed that in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, when simplicity is spoken of in a good sense, it is often carefully associated with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and uprightness. Hence it is written of the blessed Job, <em>The man was simple and upright</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse1">Job 1:1</a></span>. And the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> admonishes saying <em>Be simple in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> in good</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse19">Romans 16:19</a></span>. And the Truth in person admonishes saying, <em>Be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> as serpents, and simple as doves</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew 10:16</a></span>; thus showing it to be very unprofitable if either <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> should be wanting to simplicity, or simplicity to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. In order, then, to make His servants instructed for all things He desired them to be both simple as doves, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> as serpents, that so both the cunning of the serpent might sharpen in them the simplicity of the dove, and the simplicity of the dove temper the cunning of the serpent.</p>

<p>I therefore, who am denounced in the most serene commands of my Lords as simple without the addition of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as having been deceived by the cunning of Ariulph, am plainly and undoubtedly called silly; which I also myself acknowledge to be the case. For, though your Piety were silent, the facts cry out. For, if I had not been silly, I should by no means have come to endure what I suffer in this place among the swords of the Lombards. Moreover, in what I stated about Ariulph, that he was prepared with all his heart to come to terms with the republic, seeing that I am not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, I am reproved also as having lied. But, although I am not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> , I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it to be a grave injury to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> that, being a servant of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be deceitful. And I have been for some time aware that Nordulph is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> before me, and Leo before me, and that now easy credence is given to those who seem to be in your confidence more than to my assertions.</p>

<p>And indeed if the captivity of my land were not increasing day by day, I would gladly pass over in silence contempt and ridicule of myself. But this does afflict me exceedingly, that from my bearing the charge of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> it ensues also that <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> is daily led captive under the yoke of the Lombards. And, while my representations are in no wise <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, the strength of the enemy is increasing hugely. This however I suggest to my most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord, that he would think anything that is bad of me, but, with regard to the advantage of the republic and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the rescue of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, not easily lend his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> ears to any one, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> facts rather than words. Moreover, let not our lord, in virtue of his earthly power, too hastily disdain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but with excellent consideration, on account of Him whose servants they are, so rule over them as also to pay the reverence that is due to them. For in Holy Writ <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are sometimes called gods, and sometimes <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For even through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> it is said of him who is to be put upon his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, <em>Bring him unto the gods</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse8">Exodus 22:8</a></span>; that is unto the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. And again it is written, <em>You shall not revile the gods</em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ib. 28), to wit, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <em>The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> lips shall keep <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and they shall seek the law at his mouth; for he is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord of hosts</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse7">Malachi 2:7</a></span>. Why, then, should it be strange if your Piety were to condescend to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> those to whom even God Himself in His word gives <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, calling them <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or gods?</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical history also testifies that, when accusations in writing against <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had been offered to the Prince Constantine of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, he received indeed the bills of accusation, but, calling together the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been accused, he burnt before their eyes the bills which he had received, saying, <em>You are gods, constituted by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Go, and settle your causes among you, for it is not fit that we should judge gods.</em> Yet in this sentence, my <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Lord, he conferred more on himself by his humility than on them by the reverence paid to them. For before him there were pagan princes in the republic, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but worshipped gods of wood and stone; and yet they paid the greatest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. What wonder then if a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperor should condescend to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when pagan princes, as we have already said, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to bestow <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> on <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who served gods of wood and stone? These things, then, I suggest to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of my Lords, not in my own behalf, but in behalf of all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. For I am a man that is a sinner. And, since I offend against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> incessantly every day, I surmise that it will be some amends for this at the tremendous judgment, that I am smitten incessantly every day by blows. And I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you appease the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> all the more as you more severely afflict me who serve Him badly. For I had already received many blows, and when the commands of my Lords came in addition, I found consolations that I was not hoping for. For, if I can, I will briefly enumerate these blows.</p>

<p>First, that the peace which without any cost to the republic I had made with the Lombards who were in Tuscany was withdrawn from me. Then, the peace having been broken, the soldiers were removed from the Roman city. And some indeed were slain by the enemy, but others were placed at Narnii and Perusium (<em>Perugia</em>); and Rome was left, that Perusium might be held. After this a still heavier blow was the arrival of Agilulph, so that I saw with my own eyes Romans tied by the neck with ropes like dogs, to be taken to France for sale. And, because we who were within the city under the protection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> escaped his hands, a ground was thence sought for making us appear culpable; to wit, because grain ran short, which cannot by any means be kept in large quantities for long in this city; as I have shown more fully in another representation. On my own account indeed I was in no wise disturbed, since I declare, my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bearing me <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that I was prepared to suffer any adversity whatever, so long as I came out of all these things with the safety of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> men, Gregory the pr&aelig;fect, and Castorius the military commander (<em>magistro militum</em>), I have been distressed in no small degree, seeing that they in no way neglected to do all that could be done, and endured most severe toil in watching and guarding the city during the siege, and, after all this, were smitten by the heavy indignation of my Lords. As to them, I clearly understand that it is not their conduct, but my person, that goes against them. For, having with me alike laboured in trouble, they are alike troubled after labour.</p>

<p>Now as to the Piety of my Lords holding out over me the formidable and terrible judgment of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I beseech you by the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> to do this no more. For as yet we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how any of us will stand there. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the excellent preacher, says, <em>Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 4:5</a></span>. Yet this I briefly say, that, unworthy sinner as I am, I rely more on the mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> when He comes than on the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of your Piety. And there are many things that men are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of with regard to this judgment; for perhaps He will blame what you praise, and praise what you blame. Wherefore among all these uncertainties I return to tears only, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> may both direct our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Lord with His hand and in that terrible judgment find him free from all defaults. And may He make me so to please men, if need be, as not to offend against His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. </p>
