<h1>Book V, Letter 42</h1>

<p> <em>To Sebastian, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Sebastian, Bishop of Sirmium.</p>

<p>I have received the most sweet and pleasant letter of your Fraternity, which, though you are never absent from my heart, has nevertheless made your Holiness as it were present with me bodily. But I beseech <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> to protect you with His right hand, and to grant you a tranquil life here, and, when it shall please Him, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rewards. But I beg you, if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me with that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith you always loved me when we were together, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me more earnestly, that so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> may loose me from the bands of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and make me to stand free in His sight, released from the burden of this corruption. For, however inestimable be the sweetness of the heavenly country for drawing one towards it, yet there are many sorrows in this life to impel us daily to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of heavenly things. And these only please me exceedingly from the very fact that they do not allow anything to please me in this world.</p>

<p>For we can by no means describe, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother, what we suffer in this land at the hands of your friend, the lord Romanus.  Yet I may briefly say that his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> towards us has surpassed the swords of the Lombards; so that the enemies who kill us seem kinder than the judges of the republic, who by their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, rapines, and deceits wear us out with anxiety. And to bear at the same time the charge of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and also of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and people, and to watch anxiously against the plots of the enemy, and to be ever suspicious of the deceitfulness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the dukes; what labours and what sorrows all this involves, your Fraternity may the more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> estimate as you more purely <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me who suffer these things</p>

<p>Furthermore, while addressing you with the greeting that I owe you, I inform you that it has come to my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from the report of Boniface the <em>defensor</em>, that our brother the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> lord Anastasius the patriarch  has wished to commit to you the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in one of his cities, and that you have refused your assent. This your feeling and your wisdom I most gladly approve of, and strongly commend; and I account you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, and myself unhappy in having consented at such a time as this to undertake the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. If, however, by any chance, in condescension to your brethren, and as being intent on works of mercy, you should ever decide to consent to such a proposal, I beg you by no means to prefer any one else's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to mine. For there are in the island of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> Churches without <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and, if by the guidance of God you are pleased to take the government of a Church, you will be able to do this better near the threshold of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, with his aid. But if you are not so pleased, remain happily as you are, that this resolution may continue in you; and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us unhappy ones. Now may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> keep you under His protection, in whatever place it be His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that you should be, and bring you to heavenly rewards.</p>
