<h1>Book V, Letter 48</h1>

<p> <em>To Andrew, Scholasticus</em>. </p>

<p>Gregory to Andrew, etc.</p>

<p>We have been desirous of carrying out the wish of the most excellent the lord Patrician as to the person of Donatus, the archdeacon; but, seeing that it is very dangerous to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to lay hands on any one rashly, we took care to examine by a thorough investigation into his life and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. And, since many things have been discovered, as we have written to the said lord Patrician, which remove him far from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, we, fearing the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have not thought fit to consent to his ordination. But neither have we presumed to ordain John, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the psalms, since this circumstance certainly showed him to be too little in earnest about himself. These, then, being excluded, when we had urged the parties to choose some one from among their own people , and they declared that they had no one fit for this office, and when we together with them were the more distressed, they at length, with one common voice and consent, repeatedly solicited our venerable brother the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Marinianus, who they learned had been associated with me for a long time in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. He, shrinking from the office, was at last, by various means, with difficulty persuaded to give assent to their petition. And, since we were well acquainted with his life, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him to be solicitous in winning <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, we did not delay his ordination. Let, therefore, your Glory receive him as is becoming, and extend to his newness the aid of your succour. For to all, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, newness in any office whatever is very trying. But I have great confidence that Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has vouchsafed to put him over His flock, will both stimulate him to give heed to what is inward, and comfort him with the loving-kindness of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for administering what is outward. But, inasmuch as, after his long enjoyment of quiet, his newness, as we have before said, will without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> expose him to perturbation, I beg that, when he shall come to you flying from the whirlwinds of secular storms, he may always find in your heart a haven of rest, and be cheered by the boon of your charity. But you will soon learn how much you will find yourselves able to agree; for he comes unwillingly to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. </p>
