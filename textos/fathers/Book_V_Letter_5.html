<h1>Book V, Letter 5</h1>

<p> <em>To Dominicus, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Dominicus, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>.</p>

<p>Prosper your delegate (<em>responsalis</em>), the bearer of these presents, has been with us, and after other expressions of your charity handed us your second letters with an allegation of the imperial commands, and a paper giving an account of the synod that has been held among you.  Having read all, we rejoiced for your pastoral <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and that our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lords had given no ear to the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of venal <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> brought against you on the plea of religion; but especially that your Fraternity has so taken pains to preserve the African province as in no wise to neglect to restrain with <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> fervour the devious <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; concerning the quieting of whom we remember having laid down the law so fully, even before consulting the letters of your Charity, that we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that anything needs to be said again in reply to you about them. Although, however, this is so, and though we desire all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to be repressed always with vigour and reason by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, yet, on looking thoroughly into what has been done among you, we are in fact apprehensive lest offense should thereby be caused (which thing may the Lord avert) to the primates of other councils. For at the conclusion of your acts you have promulged a sentence, in which, while ordering the searching out of those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, you have brought in that those who neglect the duty are to be punished by forfeiture of their possessions and dignities. It is therefore best, most dear brother, that, in dealing with matters outside ourselves that require correction, charity among ourselves should first be preserved, and that we should be subject in mind (as I judge to be peculiarly proper to your Gravity) even to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> below us in dignity. For you will then more advantageously meet the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> with your whole united powers when, as befits your <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, you study to keep <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> concord among yourselves.</p>
