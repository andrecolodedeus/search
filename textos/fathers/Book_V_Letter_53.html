<h1>Book V, Letter 53</h1>

<p> <em>To Virgilius, Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Virgilius, Bishop of Arelate (<em>Arles</em>).</p>

<p>O how good is charity, which through an image in the mind exhibits what is absent as present to ourselves, through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unites what is divided, settles what is confused, associates things that are unequal, completes things that are imperfect! Rightly does the excellent preacher call it the bond of perfectness; since, though the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> indeed produce perfectness, yet still charity binds them together so that they can no longer be loosened from the heart of one who loves. Of this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, then, most dear brother, I find you to be full, as both those who came from the Gallican parts and the words also of your letter addressed to me testify to me of you.</p>

<p>Now as to your having asked therein, according to ancient custom, for the use of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> and the vicariate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, far be it from me to suspect that you have sought eminence of transitory power, or the adornment of external worship, in our vicariate and in the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. But, since it is well known to all whence the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> proceeded in the regions of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, when your Fraternity asks for a repetition of the old custom of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, what is it but that a good offspring reverts to the bosom of its mother?  With willing mind therefore we grant what has been asked for, lest we should seem either to withdraw from you anything of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to you, or to have despised the petition of our most excellent son king Childebert. But the present state of things requires the greater earnestness, that with increase of dignity solicitude also may advance, and watchfulness in the custody of others may grow, and the merits of your life may serve as an example to your subjects, and that your Fraternity may never seek your own through the dignity accorded you, but the gains of the heavenly country. For you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what the blessed apostle says, groaning, <em>For all seek their own, not the things which are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse21">Philippians 2:21</a></span>.</p>

<p>For I have learned from information given me by certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that in the parts of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and Germany no one attains to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders except for a consideration given. If this is so, I say it with tears, I declare it with groans, that, when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order has fallen inwardly, neither will it be able to stand outwardly for long. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> what our Redeemer in person did; how He went into the temple, and overthrew the seats of them that sold doves <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse12">Matthew 21:12</a></span>. For to sell doves is to receive a temporal consideration for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whom, being consubstantial with Himself, God Almighty gives to men through the imposition of hands. From which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> what follows is already intimated. For of those who presumed to sell doves in the temple of God the seats fell by God's judgment.</p>

<p>And in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> this transgression is propagated with increase among subordinates. For he who is promoted to any sacred order for a price, being already corrupted in the very root of his advancement, is the more ready to sell to others what he has bought. And where is that which is written, <em>Freely you have received, freely give</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse8">Matthew 10:8</a></span>?</p>

<p>And, seeing that the simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was the first to arise against the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, why is it not considered, why is it not seen, that whoso ordains any one for money, causes him in advancing him, to become a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>?</p>

<p>Another very detestable thing has also been reported to us; that some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, being <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, through desire of temporal <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, are tonsured on the death of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and all at once are made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In such cases it is already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what manner of man he is who attains to <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, passing suddenly from a lay estate to sacred leadership. And one who has never served as a soldier fears not to become a leader of the religious.  How is that man to preach who has perhaps never heard any one else preach? Or how shall he correct the ills of others who has never yet bewailed his own? And, where <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle prohibits a <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a> from coming to sacred orders, we are to understand that, as one was then called a <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a> who had been newly planted in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so we now reckon among neophytes one who is still new in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> conversation.</p>

<p>Moreover, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that walls after being built, are not made to carry a weight of timber till they are dried of the moisture of their newness, lest, if a weight be put on them before they are settled, it bear down the whole fabric together to the ground. And, when we cut trees for a building, we wait for the moisture of their greenness to be first dried out, lest, if the weight of the fabric is imposed on them while still fresh, they be bent from their very newness, and be the sooner broken and fall down from having been elevated prematurely. Why, then, is not this scrupulously seen to among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which is so carefully considered even in the case of timber and stones?</p>

<p>On this account your Fraternity must needs take care to admonish our most excellent son king Childebert that he remove entirely the stain of this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from his kingdom, to the end that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> may give him the greater recompense with Himself as He sees him both <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what He loves and shun what He <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>.</p>

<p>And so we commit to your Fraternity, according to ancient custom, under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our vicariate in the Churches which are under the dominion of our most excellent son Childebert , with the understanding that their proper dignity, according to primitive usage, be preserved to the several metropolitans. We have also sent a <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> for your Fraternity to use within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for the solemnization of mass only. Further, if any one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should by any chance wish to travel to any considerable distance, let it not be lawful for him to remove to other places without the authority of your Holiness. If any question of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or it may be relating to other matters, should have arisen among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, which cannot easily be settled, let it be ventilated and decided in an assembly of twelve <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But, if it cannot be decided after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has been investigated, let it be referred to our judgment.</p>

<p>Now may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> keep you under His protection, and grant unto you to preserve by your behaviour the dignity that you have received. Given the 12th day of August, Indiction 13.</p>
