<h1>Book V, Letter 54</h1>

<p> <em>To all the Bishops of the Kingdom of Childebert.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to all the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> who are under the kingdom of Childebert. </p>

<p>To this end has the provision of the divine dispensation appointed that there should be diverse degrees and distinct orders, that, while the inferiors show reverence to the more powerful and the more powerful bestow <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> on the inferiors, one contexture of concord may ensue of diversity, and the administration of all several offices may be properly borne. Nor indeed could the whole otherwise subsist; unless, that is, a great order of differences of this kind kept it together. Further, that creation cannot be governed, or live, in a state of absolute equality we are taught by the example of the heavenly hosts, since, there being <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and also archangels, it is manifest that they are not equal; but in power and rank, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, one differs from another. If then among these who are without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> there is evidently this distinction, who of men can refuse to submit himself willingly to this order of things which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that even <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>? For hence peace and charity embrace each other mutually, and the sincerity of concord remains firm in the reciprocal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Since, then, each single duty is then salubriously fulfilled when there is one president who may be referred to, we have therefore perceived it to be opportune, in the Churches that are under the dominion of our most excellent son king Childebert, to give our vicariate jurisdiction, according to ancient custom, to our brother Virgilius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Arelate, to the end that the integrity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that is of the four <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synods, may be preserved under the protection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with attentive devotion, and that, if any contention should by chance arise among our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, he may allay it by the rigour of his authority with discreet moderation, as representing the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. We have also charged him that, if such a dispute should arise in any cases as to require the presence of others, he should assemble our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in competent number, and discuss the matter salubriously with due regard to equity, and decide it with canonical integrity. But if a contention (which may the Divine power avert) should happen to arise on matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or any business come up about which there may perchance be serious <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and he should be in need of the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> in place of his own greatness, we have directed him that, having diligently enquired into the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he should take care to bring the question under our cognizance by a report from himself, to the end that it may be terminated by a suitable sentence so as to remove all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>.</p>

<p>And, since it is necessary that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should assemble at suitable times for conference before him to whom we have granted our vicariate jurisdiction as often as he may think it, we exhort that none of you presume to be disobedient to his orders, or defer attending the general conclave, unless perchance bodily infirmity should prevent any one, or a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> excuse in any case should allow his absence. Yet let such as are unavoidably prevented from attending the synod send a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in their stead, to the end that the things that, with the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may be decided by our vicar, may come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of him who is absent by a faithful report through the person whom he had sent, and be observed with unshaken steadfastness, and that there be no occasion of excuse for daring to violate them.</p>

<p>About this also we take the precaution of warning you, that none of you may attempt in any way to depart to places at any great distance without the authority of our aforesaid brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Virgilius, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the orders of our predecessors, who granted vicariate jurisdiction to his predecessors, undoubtedly lay this down.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we exhort that each one of you give careful attention to his own office, so that he who desires to receive the reward promised for feeding the sheep may guard the flock committed to him with carefulness and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, lest the prowling wolf should invade and tear the sheep entrusted to him, and there should be in the retribution punishment instead of reward. We hope, therefore, most dear brethren, and we entreat <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> with all our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, that He would make you to be fervent more and more in the constancy of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and grant you especially to be retained in the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in agreement together.</p>

<p>It has been reported to us that some are promoted to sacred orders through simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; and we have ordered our above-written brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Virgilius that this must be altogether prohibited; and, that your Fraternity may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and studiously observe this, our letter to him is to be read in your presence. Given the 12th day of August, Indiction 13.</p>
