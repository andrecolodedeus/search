<h1>Book V, Letter 8</h1>

<p> <em>To Cyprian, Deacon.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Cyprian, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and rector of the patrimony of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.</p>

<p>Concerning the Manicheans who are on our possessions I have frequently admonished your Love to press them with the utmost diligence, and recall them to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. If, then, the time requires it, make enquiries in person, or, if other business does not allow this, through others. Further, it has come to my ears that there are Hebrews on our possessions who will not by any means be converted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it seems to me that you should send letters through all our possessions on which these Hebrews are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be, promising them particularly from me that whosoever of them shall have been converted to our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lord God <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> shall have the burdens of his holding lightened. And this I wish to have done in such sort that, if one has a payment to make of one <em>solidus</em>, a third should be remitted him; if of three or four, that one <em>solidus</em> should be remitted; if of any more, the remission should still be made in the same proportion, or at any rate according as your Love sees fit, so that one who is converted may have some relief of his burden, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may not be put to heavy expense. Nor shall we do this unprofitably, if by lightening the burdens of their payments we bring them to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since, though they themselves came with little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, yet those who may be born of them will now be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with more <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: thus we gain either them or their children. And whatever amount of payment we let them off for the sake of Christ is nothing serious. Furthermore, some time ago, when John the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> came, your Love wrote something to me, the whole of which I read at the time, but let many days intervene before replying; and then, after such delay, replied to all particulars as I recollected them. But now I think that one point escaped my memory, and suspect that I gave no reply about it. For you had written that loans were being advanced to peasants (<em>rusticis</em>) through certain undertakers for their debt , lest in borrowing from others they should be burdened either by exactions or by the prices of things.  This particular was to me most acceptable; and, if indeed I have already written about it, observe what I wrote. But if, as I suspect, I gave in my reply no definite direction on the subject, you must not hesitate to advance money for the advantage of the peasants, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> property will not thus be wasted, and out of it the peasants will derive advantage. And, if there are other things which you consider to be advantageous, you must carry them out without any hesitation.</p>
