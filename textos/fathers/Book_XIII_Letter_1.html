<h1>Book XIII, Letter 1</h1>

<p> <em>To the Roman Citizens.</em></p>

<p>Gregory, servant of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to his most beloved sons the Roman citizens.</p>

<p>It has come to my ears that certain men of perverse spirit have sown among you some things that are wrong and opposed to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so as to forbid any work being done on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>. What else can I call these but preachers of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, who, when he comes, will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> as well as the Lord's day to be kept free from all work. For, because he pretends to die and rise again, he wishes the Lord's day to be had in reverence; and, because he compels the people to judaize that he may bring back the outward rite of the law, and subject the perfidy of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to himself, he wishes the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> to be observed.</p>

<p>For this which is said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <em>You shall bring in no burden through your gates on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse24">Jeremiah 17:24</a></span>, could be held to as long as it was lawful for the law to be observed according to the letter. But after that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> has appeared, the commandments of the law which were spoken figuratively cannot be kept according to the letter. For, if any one says that this about the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> is to be kept, he must needs say that carnal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are to be offered: he must say too that the commandment about the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the body is still to be retained. But let him hear the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> saying in opposition to him, <em>If you be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, Christ profits you nothing</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse2">Galatians 5:2</a></span>.</p>

<p>We therefore accept spiritually, and hold spiritually, this which is written about the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> means rest. But we have the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> in our Redeemer Himself, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>. And whoso acknowledges the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him, if he draws the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of concupiscence through his eyes into his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he introduces burdens through the gates on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>. We introduce, then, no burden through the gates on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> if we draw no weights of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through the bodily senses to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For we read that the same our Lord and Redeemer did many works on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, so that he reproved the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, saying, <em>Which of you does not loose his ox or his ass on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, and lead him away to watering</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse15">Luke 13:15</a></span>? If, then, the very Truth in person commanded that the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> should not be kept according to the letter, whoso keeps the rest of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> according to the letter of the law, whom else does he contradict but the Truth himself?</p>

<p>Another thing also has been brought to my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; namely that it has been preached to you by perverse men that no one ought to wash on the Lord's day. And indeed if any one craves to wash for luxury and pleasure, neither on any other day do we allow this to be done. But if it is for bodily need, neither on the Lord's day do we forbid it. For it is written, <em>No man ever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his own flesh, but nourishes it and cherishes it</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse29">Ephesians 5:29</a></span>. And again it is written, <em>Make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse14">Romans 13:14</a></span>. He, then, who forbids provision for the flesh in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof certainly allows it in the needs thereof. For, if it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to wash the body on the Lord's day, neither ought the face to be washed on that day. But if this is allowed for a part of the body, why is it denied for the whole body when need requires? On the Lord's day, however, there should be a cessation of earthly labour, and attention given in every way to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, so that if anything is done negligently during the six days, it may be expiated by supplications on the day of the Lord's resurrection.</p>

<p>These things, most dear sons, being endowed with sure constancy and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, observe; despise the words of foolish men, and give not easy belief to all that you hear of having been said by them; but weigh it in the scale of reason, so that, while in firm stability you resist the wind of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> you may be able to attain to the solid joys of the heavenly kingdom.</p>
