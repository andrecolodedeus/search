<h1>Book XIII, Letter 18</h1>

<p> <em>To certain Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Leo, Secundinus, John, Donus, Lucidus, Trajan, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.</p>

<p>Even as we are admonished through the speech of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to impart one to another spiritual aids&mdash;so, in matters that by God's ordering we may have to settle in virtue of the government imposed on us for administration of the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, it is fit that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> succour be not wanting. Accordingly in sending the bearer of these presents, Adrian our <em>Chartularius</em> , to govern the patrimony of our Church, to wit in the Syracusan district, we have thought it necessary to commend him to your Fraternity, that, wherein custom may demand it, you may afford him your succour, to the end that, while he is supported by you with bodily aid for doing his work, and with the spiritual aid of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for carrying out with facility whatever he may undertake, he may be able, God also working with him, to accomplish prosperously what has been by us enjoined on him. But, as for yourselves, you should so acquit yourselves in good works before the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that there be not found in your doings anything that may be smitten by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or for which you may be accused by any man whatever lying in wait against you. For we have charged our aforesaid <em>Chartularius</em> that, if he should come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of any inordinate doings on the part of our most reverend brethren the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he should first himself take them to task by private and modest admonition; and, that, if such things are not amended, he should inform us of them speedily.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it has been reported to us that in the times of our predecessor of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory it was arranged by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Servusdei, who then had charge of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> patrimony, that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>  of your several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, when you go forth to seal infants , should not be immoderately burdened. For a certain sum had been fixed, and this, as I hear, with your consent, to be given by the same <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the services of the clerks (<em>clericorum</em>). And this, which was then approved of, is said to be by no means kept to now. Wherefore I admonish your Fraternity to endeavour not to be burdensome to your subjects, and, if they have any grievances, to abate them, seeing also that you ought not to have departed from what had once been determined. For you will be seeing to your own interest both in the future and the present life, if you keep those who have been committed to you free from grievance.</p>
