<h1>Book XIII, Letter 42</h1>

<p> <em>To Eulogius, Patriarch of Alexandria.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Eulogius, etc.</p>

<p>We return great thanks to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that in the mouth of the heart a sweet savour of charity is experienced, when that which is written is fulfilled, <em>As cold water to a thirsty <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> news from a far country</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro025.htm#verse25">Proverbs 25:25</a></span>. For I had previously been greatly disturbed by a letter from Boniface the <em>Chartularius</em>, my <em>responsalis</em>, who dwells in the royal city, saying that your to me most sweet and pleasant Holiness had suffered from failure of bodily sight. From this letter I was smitten by heavy sorrow. But suddenly, by the prospering <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of our Creator and Redeemer, I received the epistle of your Blessedness, and, learning that the bodily trouble of which I had heard was cured, I rejoiced exceedingly, since <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> of heart succeeded which was as great as the bitterness of the sadness which had come before. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, with the help of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your life is the health of many. For sailors sail secure through the waves when an instructed and skilful steersman sits at the helm.</p>

<p>Moreover in my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for your health I have this additional <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for exultation, that I have learned how through your mouth the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are decreased in number, and the flocks of the Lord multiplied. For through the ploughshare of your tongue heavenly grain increases daily, and is multiplied in the garners on high; so that in you we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that what is written is fulfilled, <em>Where there is much increase, there is manifest the strength of the oxen</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse4">Proverbs 14:4</a></span>. Whence we gather plainly that the more you bring back fugitives to the service of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the more merit you have with Him. And by how much the more merit you receive, the more fully can you obtain what you ask for. I beseech you therefore to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the more earnestly for me a sinner, since both pain of body, and bitterness of heart, and immense ravages of mortality among the swords of so many barbarians, afflict me exceedingly. In the midst of all these things it is not temporal but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> consolation that I require, which of myself I am not able to win by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but which I trust that I shall obtain by the intercessions of your Blessedness. Last year I received no letters from your Holiness, and I was much distressed. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that your blessing, which you sent without a letter, was both given and received. But, since your tongue delights me more than your gifts, I was less gratified than I might have been by what was given. But I directed our common son, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Epiphanius, to write to Alexander and Isidore, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of your most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, to acknowledge the receipt of what had been sent.</p>

<p>I wrote to you, further, that I had got ready large pieces of timber for making masts and rudders, but that the small ship which had come could not carry them; and you have since written nothing in reply. Wherefore, if you need them, write to our common son Boniface, whom we are now sending as our representative (<em>responsalem</em>) to the royal city, that he may send me word that they may be prepared, and that they may be found ready when your Blessedness shall send for them.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we have sent you a small cross, in which is inserted a blessing from the chains of your lovers the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> Saint Peter and Saint <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; and let this be continually applied to your eyes, seeing that many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> have been wont to be wrought through this same blessing.</p>

<p>May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> inspire the heart of your Blessedness to be careful to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me continually, and may He protect you and all yours with His right hand, and after many courses of years bring you to the heavenly kingdom.</p>

<p>We have received, corresponding with your description of them, the blessings  of Saint Mark, sent to us by your most blessed Fraternity, and we return thanks for your kindness, since from these outward things we learn what you are towards us inwardly.</p>
