<h1>Book XIII, Letter 5</h1>

<p> <em>To Etherius, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lugdunum (Lyons)</a></em>.</p>

<p>Gregory to Etherius, Bishop.</p>

<p>Although what we say is very distressing to us, and fraternal compassion rather moves us to weep than allows us to lay down anything concerning the things we have heard of, yet solicitude for the government undertaken by us pricks our heart with an urgent spur to see with great care to the good of churches, and to arrange what should be done before their interests might possibly suffer irretrievably. It has come, then, to our ears from the report of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that an affection of the head has so befallen a certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that it is a matter of groaning and weeping to hear of what he is wont to do under alienation of mind. Lest, therefore, while the shepherd is sick, the flock should be exposed to be torn by the teeth of the lyer-in-wait (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid), or the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself should suffer irretrievably, it is necessary for us to treat the case with cautious provision. And so, since during the life of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whom unavoidable infirmity and not crime withdraws from his office, no reason allows another to be ordained in his place except on his resignation , let him, if he is accustomed to have intervals of sanity, himself make petition, declaring that he is no longer equal to this ministry owing to subversion of his intellectual faculties by infirmity, and let him request that another be ordained in his place. Which being done, let another who may be worthy be solemnly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his place, by the election of all; yet so that, as long as life shall retain the said <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in this world, his due expenses be supplied to him by the same Church. If, however, he at no time recovers the faculties of a sound <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, a trustworthy person of approved life must be chosen, who may be fit for the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, take thought for the benefit of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, restrain the unquiet under the bond of discipline, take care of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> property, and exhibit himself in all respects ripe and efficient. And also, should he survive the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who is now sick, he should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in his place.</p>

<p>But as to ordinations of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, or of any other order, if <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> requires any to be made in that Church, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is to be reserved to your Fraternity, to the end that, it being in your diocese, you may enquire concerning the life, manners, and conduct of him who is chosen to such office. And if you should be satisfied, and there is nothing in him liable to the censure of canonical strictness, let him attain to his destined order not otherwise than through ordination by you. Let your Fraternity then, so proceed, and so order these things with vigilant provision, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> may no longer suffer from any neglect, and that you may warn your fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, not only by word but also by example, to have a care laudably for venerable places.</p>
