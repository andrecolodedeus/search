<h1>Book XIII, Letter 7</h1>

<p> <em>To Theoderic, King of the Franks</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Theoderic, etc.</p>

<p>We have received with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> your written address to us indicating your health and safety, and we thereby perceive that you so transcend your age in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as to make it evident that it is for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the nation of the Franks that the government of royal dominion has been committed by the favour of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to your Excellency. And this in you among other things is enough to call for praise and admiration, that in such things as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that our daughter your most excellent grandmother desires for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in these you make haste most earnestly to lend your aid, so that thereby you may reign both happily here, and in a future life with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> . Seeing, then, that this comes, by the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from great discreetness of judgment, we have so speedily and gladly fulfilled what your Excellency desires as to show by the celerity of our execution how much your good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> have pleased us.</p>

<p>Furthermore, greeting you with paternal sweetness, we inform you that all the matters which you enjoined on the illustrious men your servants Burgoaldus and Varmaricarius, our sons, to be transacted with us have been disclosed to us in a private interview. And we praised you greatly, that you both attend wisely, as becomes you, to the present, and also make haste so to provide for security in the future by means of a lasting peace between you and the Republic that, being made one, you may extend the stability of your kingdom salutarily to all time. With regard to this we will announce to you in time to come what it may please God to order. For, as to us, whatever is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be advantageous and conducive to peace, we desire and strive that it should be brought to pass. The one thing is that, as our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is with regard to what is expedient, so should be the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without whom we can do nothing. May the Holy Trinity make you to advance always in His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and so dispose your heart in moderation well-pleasing to Him as both to grant to your subjects now <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> from you, and to you from Himself <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> without end hereafter.</p>
