<h1>Book XIII, Letter 9</h1>

<p> <em>To Thalassia, Abbess.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Thalassia, etc.</p>

<p>When the hearts of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> kings are so inflamed with ardent desire, by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> preventing them, as of their own accord to demand the things that pontifical admonitions should provoke them to, such things are to be granted with cheerful and joyful mind all the more as the very things which they desire ought to have been demanded of them, had they been unwilling to do them. Accordingly, in accordance with the letters of our most Excellent royal children, Brunichild and her grandson Theoderic, to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint Mary, where there is constituted a congregation of handmaidens of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, founded in the city of Augustodunum by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Siagrius of reverend memory, over which you preside, we indulge, grant and confirm by the decree of our present authority privileges as follows&mdash;Ordaining that no king, no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, no one endowed with any dignity whatsoever, or any one else whatsoever, shall have power, under show of any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or occasion whatsoever, to diminish or take away, or apply to his own uses, or grant as if to other <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> uses for excuse of his own <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, anything of what has been given to the same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by the above-written king's own children, or of what shall in future be bestowed on it by any others whatever of their own possessions. But all things that have been there offered, or may come to be offered, we will to be possessed by you, as well as by those who shall succeed you in your office and place, from the present time inviolate and without disturbance, provided you apply them in all ways to the uses of those for whose sustentation and government they have been granted.</p>

<p>We also appoint that on the death of an abbess of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> no other shall be ordained by means of any kind of craftiness of secret scheming, but such a one as the king of the same province, with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, shall have chosen in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and provided for the ordination of.</p>

<p>Under this head we also add, in order that we may exclude all place for <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, that no one of the kings, no one of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or any one else in person or by proxy, shall dare to accept anything in gold, or in any kind of consideration whatever, for the ordination of such abbess, or for any causes whatever pertaining to this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and that the same abbess presume not to give anything on account of her ordination, lest by such occasion what is offered or has been offered to places of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> should be consumed. And, inasmuch as many occasions for the deception of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are sought out, as is said, in your parts by bad men, we ordain that an abbess of this same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> shall in no way be deprived or deposed unless in case of criminality requiring it. Hence it is necessary that if any complaint of this kind should arise against her, not only the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Augustodunum should examine the case, but that he should call to his assistance six other of his fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and so fully investigate the matter, to the end that, all judging with one accord, a strict canonical decision may either smite her if guilty, or absolve her if innocent.</p>

<p>All these things, therefore, which the paper of this our precept and decree contains we decree to be observed in perpetuity for you as well as for all who may succeed you in the same rank and place, and for all whom they may concern. Moreover, if any one, whether king, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, judge, or secular person, being aware of this our written constitution, should attempt to contravene it, let him be deprived of the dignity of his power and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he stands guilty before divine judgment for the iniquity that he has perpetrated. And, unless he either restore what he has wrongfully taken away, or lament what he has done unlawfully with fit penitence, let him be debarred from the most sacred body and blood of our God and Lord, the Redeemer <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and be subject to strict vengeance in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> judgment. But the peace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> be to all who observe what is just to this same place, to the end that they may both receive here the fruit of their well-doing, and find the rewards of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> peace at the hands of the strict Judge.</p>
