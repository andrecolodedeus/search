<h1>Book XII, Letter 24</h1>

<p> <em>To John, Subdeacon of Ravenna</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to John, etc.</p>

<p>Some <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who came to me from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the late abbot Claudius have petitioned me that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Constantius should be constituted their abbot. But I was exceedingly set against them as touching their petition, because they appeared to me to be altogether of a worldly mind in seeking to have a very worldly man for their abbot. For I have learned how this same Constantius studies to possess property of his own: and this is the strongest evidence that he has not the heart of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. And I have learned further that he presumed to go alone, without any one of his brethren with him, to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> that is situate in the province of Picenum. From this proceeding of his we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he who walks without a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> lives not aright: and how can he maintain the rule for others who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not how to maintain it for himself?</p>

<p>Giving him up, therefore, they asked to have a certain cellarer, Maurus by name, to whose life and industry there are many testimonies, the late abbot Claudius also with certain others having spoken in his praise. Let your Experience therefore make careful enquiry; and, if his life should be such as fit him for a place of government, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> him to be ordained abbot by our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Marinianus. But, if there is anything decidedly against him, and they cannot find any suitable person in their own congregation, let them choose some one from elsewhere, and let him whom they may choose be made abbot. Further, take care by all means to tell our aforesaid brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to put down with the utmost earnestness the possession of property of their own by four or five of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which it has been found so far impossible to correct, and to make haste to cleanse this same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> from such a pest; since, if private property is held there by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, it will not be possible for either concord or charity to continue in this same congregation. What, indeed, is a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk's</a> state of life but a despising of the world? How, then, do they despise the world who while placed in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> seek gold? Wherefore let your Experience so proceed that neither the ordering of the place be deferred, nor any complaint reach us any more on this subject.</p>

<p>Furthermore, forasmuch as my late most dear son Claudius had heard me speak something about the Proverbs, the Song of Songs, the Prophets, and also about the Books of Kings and the Heptateuch, which on account of my infirmity I was unable to commit to writing, and he himself had dictated them for transcription according to his own understanding of their meaning, lest they should be forgotten, and in order that he might bring them to me at a suitable time, so that they might be more correctly dictated (for, when he read to me what he had written, I found the sense of what I had said had been altered very disadvantageously), it is hence necessary that your Experience, avoiding all excuse or delay, should go to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and assemble the brethren, and that they should produce fully and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> whatsoever papers on various Scriptures he had brought there; which do take, and transmit them to me with all possible speed.</p>

<p>Further, about your return, having learned that you have incurred serious trouble, we will consider by and by. Further, I have not been pleased to hear what has been told me by certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; namely that our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Marinianus causes my comments on the blessed Job to be read publicly at <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>; seeing that this is not a popular work, and engenders hindrance rather than advancement to rude hearers. But tell him to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the comments on the Psalms to be read at <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, which mould the minds of secular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to good manners. For indeed I do not wish, while I am in this flesh, that what I may have said should be readily made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to men. For I took it amiss that Anatolius the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of most beloved memory gave to the lord Emperor, at his request and command, the book of Pastoral Rule, which my most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Anastasius of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> translated into the Greek tongue. And, as I was informed by letter, it pleased him much; but it much displeased me that those who have what is better should be occupied in what is least.</p>

<p>Further, in the third part of the blessed Job, in the verse wherein it is written, <em>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my Redeemer lives</em>, I suspect that my aforesaid brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Marinianus has a corrupt copy. For in the copy in our bookcase this passage is given differently from what I find to be in the copies possessed by others; and consequently I have had this passage corrected, so that our often-named brother may have it as it is in our bookcase. For there are four words, the absence of which from the passage may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the reader no little difficulty. Execute all these things thoroughly and speedily. And, if you can do nothing with the most excellent Exarch, show yourself not to have neglected to do what is in your power.</p>

<p>What shall I say concerning the place of Albinus, as to which the answer given us is plainly contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>? You ought, however, to consider the case attentively. Furthermore, a little time ago we had enjoined your Experience to treat with our most eminent son the pr&aelig;fect to the end that the care of the conduits (<em>formarum</em>) should be committed to Augustus the vicecount, in that he is in all respects a diligent and energetic man . And you have so far so put off the business as not even to inform us of what you have done. And so, even now, hasten with all earnestness to treat with the same our most eminent son, that the conduits may be entirely committed to the aforesaid most distinguished man, to the intent that he may to some extent succeed in repairing them. For these conduits are so scorned and neglected that, unless greater attention be given to them, within a short time they will go utterly to ruin. As you know, then, how necessary this business is, and how advantageous to the general community, you must use your best endeavours that it may be committed, as we have said, to the aforesaid man for his careful attention. Given in the month of January, Indiction 5.</p>
