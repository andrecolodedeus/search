<h1>Book XII, Letter 29</h1>

<p> <em>To Victor, Bishop</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Victor, etc.</p>

<p>While on the one hand it is a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to us to learn that our brethren are solicitous about their children in fatherly charity, on the other we count it no less a matter for sadness when neither regard for other brethren nor consideration of their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office avails to restrain them from unlawful doings. How serious, then, and how harsh is the complaint against our brother Paulinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Tegessis, made by his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and by those who are in sacred orders, I have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is well known to your Fraternity, since what has reached us from a distance cannot have been hidden from you who art near at hand. And, since there is need of great caution lest this bodily injury which they complain of at his hands in excess of his powers should be ventured on with allowance, or should grow worse by being connived at, manifest excesses should ever be so suppressed by canonical control that one proceeding may serve as a reproof of what is past and a rule for the future. Accordingly it becomes you, together with our most beloved common brother the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Columbus, and with other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> whom you may think fit to call on, to sift the case between our above-named brother and his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by means of a thorough investigation. And, if the complaint of the petitioners stands with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so correct ye this thing by a regular reformation, that he may both be made aware what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing he has done and learn for the future not to exceed the limits of his office. And suffer him not, as is said to be the case, to disregard the rank of your position, lest his contempt be to his risk and to your blame. For whatever is committed by an inferior, unless it be carefully corrected, reflects on the person who occupies the superior place.</p>

<p>That other matter also, namely that the same our brother Paulinus is said to confer <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> orders for money, you should fully and very strictly enquire into. And, if it should clearly appear to be so, as we hope will not be the case, let your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for God so kindle itself to avenge this wrong that both the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> of the ordainer may be turned into a penalty, and, the unlawful ordination being void of effect, the person ordained may not enjoy the longed-for object of his ambition. Herein we exhort you and before all things admonish you, that your Fraternity study to be so solicitous that, before the iniquity of simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> shall gain strength in your parts from the offense of one, it may be cut off from the root by the pruning-hook of your sentence after a council diligently held. For whosoever does not, in consideration of his office, burn vehemently to correct this atrocity, let him not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he will have his portion with him from whom this peculiar enormity took its beginning. And so, as we have said, you must act vigilantly and earnestly, that your council, which up to this time, under God's keeping, has been preserved from any bad repute of this kind, may not by any possibility be polluted and ruined by the poison of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we have given orders to Hilarus our Chartularius, that, if the case should require it, he defer not to join you. Wherefore, should it be necessary, inform him by your letters of the need of his coming to you, to the end that you, together with him, may be able, God helping you, to determine all these things in a salutary way.</p>
