<h1>Book XIV, Letter 12</h1>

<p> <em>To Theodelinda, Queen of the Lombards.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Queen Theodelinda.</p>

<p>The letters which you sent us a little time ago from the Genoese parts have made us partakers of your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> on account of our learning that by the favour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> a son has been given you, and, as is greatly to your Excellency's credit, has been received into the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . Nor indeed was anything else to be supposed of your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> but that you would fortify him whom you have received by the gift of God with the aid of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rectitude, so that our Redeemer might both acknowledge you as His familiar servant, and also bring up prosperously in His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> a new king for the nation of the Lombards. Wherefore we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> both to keep you in the way of His commandments, and to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> our most excellent son, Adulouvald , to advance in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, to the end that, as he is in this world great among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so also he may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> for his good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> before the eyes of our God.</p>

<p>Now as to what your Excellency has requested in your letter, that we should reply in full to what our most beloved son, the abbot Secundus has written , who could think of putting off his petition or your wishes, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how profitable they would be to many, did not sickness stand in the way? But so great an infirmity from gout has held us fast as to render us hardly able to rise, not only for dictating, but even for speaking, as also your ambassadors, the bearers of these presents, are aware, who, when they arrived, found us weak, and when they departed, left us in the utmost peril and danger of our life. But, if by the ordering of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> I should recover, I will reply in full to all that he has written. I have, however, sent by the bearers of these presents the Synod that was held in the time of Justinian of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, that my aforesaid most-beloved son may acknowledge on reading it that all that he had heard against the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> or the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was false. For far be it from us to accept the views of any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> whatever, or to deviate in any respect from the tome of our predecessor Leo, of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory; but we receive whatever has been defined by the four <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synods, and condemn whatever has been rejected by them.</p>

<p>Further, to our son the King Adolouvald we have taken thought to send some phylacteries; that is, a cross with wood of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> cross of the Lord, and a lection of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> enclosed in a Persian case. Also to my daughter, his sister, I send three rings, two of them with hyacinths, and one with an <em>albula</em> , which I request may be given them through you, that our charity towards them may be seasoned by your Excellency.</p>

<p>Furthermore, while paying you our duty of greeting with fatherly charity, we beg you to return thanks in our behalf to our most excellent son the King your consort for the peace that has been made, and to move his mind to peace, as you have been accustomed to do, in all ways for the future; that so, among your many good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, you may be able in the sight of God to find reward in an innocent people, which might have perished in offense.</p>
