<h1>Book XIV, Letter 16</h1>

<p> <em>From Felix Bishop of Messana</em>  <em>to St. Gregory.</em></p>

<p>To the most blessed and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> lord, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> father Pope Gregory, Felix lover of your Weal and Holiness.</p>

<p>The claims under God of your most blessed Weal and Holiness are manifest. For, though the whole earth was filled with observance of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the preaching and doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, having been founded by <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> institution and most firmly established by the faithful fathers, is further built up through the teaching of divine discourses, while instructed by your hortatory admonition. To it did all the most blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, endowed with an equal participation of dignity and authority , convert hosts of peoples; and by salutary precepts and admonitions, piously and holily, brought such as were foreknown in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of divine <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> from darkness to light, from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, from death to life. Following the merits of these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and perfectly acting up to their example, your honoured Paternity adorns with them the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> by probity of manners and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; and, strong in sacred <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> manners, enjoins what should be done to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and unceasingly follows and fulfils pontifical duties, thus observing the precepts of divine law; since (as says the Apostle) <em>Not the hearers of the law are just before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the doers of the law shall be justified</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse13">Romans 2:13</a></span>.</p>

<p>As we were meditating on these things, news was brought us by certain who came from Rome that you had written to our comrade Augustine (afterwards ordained Bishop for the nation of the Angli, and there sent by your venerable Holiness), and to the Angli (whom we have long <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have been <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> through you), that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> related in the fourth degree of descent, if married, should not be separated . Now this was not formerly the custom either in those or in these parts, when I was brought up and taught together with you from infancy; nor have I read of it in any decrees of your predecessors, or in the institutes of other Fathers generally or specially, or learned that it had been allowed hitherto by any of the wise. But I have found from your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> predecessors, and from the rest of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, assembled as well in the Nicene synod as in other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> councils, that this [i.e. <em>this prohibition of marriage</em>] should be observed down to the seventh degree of descent; and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is carefully seen to by men who live aright and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord. While these things were being discussed among us, other things also supervened, concerning which it seems necessary for us to consult your authority. For there came to us both Benedict, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Syracusan Church, and also others of our brethren, being <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, weeping, and saying that they were greatly disturbed and afflicted in mind on account of the immoderate proceedings of secular and lay <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, in consequence of which some <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> things were also being said against them.</p>

<p>There are also some churches in our province about the consecration of which <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is felt; and, because both of their antiquity and of the carelessness of their custodians, it is unknown whether they have been dedicated by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or not. As to all these things we beg to be instructed by your Holiness, and by the authority of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> see; and we ask to be informed by your letters whether what, as we have before said, we have heard that you had written to our aforesaid comrade Augustine and to the nation of the Angli was written specially to them or generally to all; and we desire to be fully informed both on this matter and on the others above written.</p>

<p>For we do not signify to you what we have read, and what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be observed by the faithful, by way of finding fault (which be far from us); but we seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what we may reasonably and faithfully observe in this matter. And, since no slight murmuring is going on among us on this question, we seek an answer from you, as from the head, as to what we should reply to our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; lest we should remain doubtful in the matter, and lest this murmuring should remain among us both in your times and in times to come, and your <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, which has always been good and excellent, should be lacerated or disparaged through detractions, or your name (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) should be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spoken of in succeeding times. For we, observing under God what is right with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> heart, being bound to you in one bond of charity, and defending your religion in all things as faithful pupils, seek <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is right from you. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in the first place who were prelates of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> See, and their successors afterwards, have always done, so you also take care of the universal Church, and especially of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who on account of their <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and speculation are called the eyes of the Lord; and that you think continually about our religion and law, as it is written,  <em>Blessed is he who shall meditate in the law of the Lard day and night</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse2">Psalm 1:2</a></span>. Which meditation of yours is not only seen by reading, through the outward expression of letters, but, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ abounding in you, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be immoveably engrafted in your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; while the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> law of Christ the Lord in no wise departs from your heart; as says the Prophet in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <em>The mouth of the righteous will meditate wisdom, and his tongue will be talking of judgments: the law of God is in his heart</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse30">Psalm 36:30</a></span>; written not with ink, but in secret by the Spirit of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not therefore on tables of stone, but on the tables of the heart. Let all gloom of darkness, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, be dispelled by your most wise replies and assistance, that the morning star may shine upon us through you, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Father, and a dogmatic definition causing <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to all everywhere, because the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Fathers of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have preached proper and most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> unto secure inheritance of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<p> <em>Subscription</em>. May the Lord keep you safe and well-pleasing to God for ever, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> father of fathers, while you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us.</p>
