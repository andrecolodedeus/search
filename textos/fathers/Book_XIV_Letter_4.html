<h1>Book XIV, Letter 4</h1>

<p> <em>To Fantinus, Guardian (Defensorem) of Panormus.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Fantinus, etc.</p>

<p>Such things about our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Exhilaratus, as you yourself also <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a>, have come to our ears as ought by all means to be visited with severe punishment. But, since it has been smoothed over by our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Leo , who has also declared that he was judge in that case, we have thought it fit that he [i.e. Exhilaratus] should be sent back to his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, considering that what we have inflicted on him by keeping him here so long may be enough for him. Therefore we enjoin your Experience to pay attention to his manners and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and to admonish him frequently, to the end that he may show himself solicitous in extending kind charity to his clerks (<em>clericis</em>), and, should need require, in correcting faults. But we desire you also to admonish his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> that they exhibit humility towards him, and the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> which the Lord commands, nor in any respect presume to behave proudly with regard to him. And if any one of them, that is, either <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or clerk, should disregard your admonition, do thou, under this authority from us, either correct the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of disobedience by canonical coercion, as you see fit, or make haste to send a report to us, that we may be able to arrange how the rein of discipline may keep from going off their road those whom the goad of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> inclination provokes to transgression.</p>
