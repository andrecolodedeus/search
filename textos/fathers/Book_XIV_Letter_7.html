<h1>Book XIV, Letter 7</h1>

<p> <em>To Alcyson, Bishop of Corcyra.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Alcyson, etc.</p>

<p>Not undeservedly does the ambition of an elated heart require to be quelled, when, disregarding the force of the sacred canons, the excess of rash presumption in <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> unlawfully what belongs to others is shown to be not only harmful in causing expense, but also opposed to the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Having, then, perused your Fraternity's epistles, we have learned what has been done formerly or of late by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the City of Euria with regard to the camp of Cassiopus , which is situated in your diocese, and we are distressed that those who should have been debtors to your Church for charity bestowed upon them, should rather become its enemies, no shame restraining them; and at last that, in a way contrary to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> arrangement, contrary to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> moderation, contrary to the ordinances of the sacred canons, they should attempt to withdraw the aforesaid camp from your jurisdiction and subject it to their own power, so as to become as it were masters where they had before been received as strangers. Concerning which matter, seeing that Andrew, our brother of venerable memory, Metropolitan of Nicopolis, with the support also of an imperial order whereby the cognizance of this case had been enjoined on him, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have determined in a sentence promulged by him, as has been made manifest to us, that the aforesaid camp of Cassiopus should remain under the jurisdiction of your Church as it always has been, we, approving of the form of that sentence, confirm it, as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> approves, by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and decree that it remain firm in all respects. For no reason of equity, no canonical order, sanctions that one person should in any way occupy the parish  of another. Wherefore, though the guilt of this contentiousness seems to require no slight strictness of treatment, in that they have returned <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for good, nevertheless care should be taken that kindness be not overcome by excess, nor that what is due to strange brethren, when they are suffering constraint too, be denied them, lest charity should be judged to have no operation in the minds of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, if those to whom great compassion is due should be left without the remedy of consolation. It is right, then, that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the city of Euria be not repelled from habitation of the aforesaid camp of Cassiopus, but that they should have leave also to deposit with due reverence the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and venerable body of the blessed Donatus, which they have brought with them, in one of the churches of the aforesaid place such as they may choose. Yet so that protection be procured for your Love, in whose diocese this camp is situate, by the issue of a security whereby the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Euria shall promise not to claim for himself any power therein, or any privilege, or any jurisdiction, or any authority in future, as though he were cardinal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but that, peace being restored by the favour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they shall return by all means to their own places, taking away with them, if they will, the venerable body of Saint Donatus. So, this promise being kept in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, neither may they dare on any pretext whatever to claim further to themselves any right of rule there, but acknowledge themselves guests there at all times, nor may the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of your Fraternity in any degree incur prejudice to its rights and privileges.</p>
