<h1>Book XI, Letter 25</h1>

<p> <em>To Januarius, Bishop of Caralis (Cagliari</em>  <em>).</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Januarius, etc.</p>

<p>Know that your Fraternity's solicitude has pleased us, in that you have evinced, as was right, pastoral vigilance for the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For indeed it has been reported to us that you have forbidden a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to be founded in the house of the late Epiphanius, a reader of your Church, in accordance with his will, for this reason; lest, seeing that this house was adjacent to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of hand-maidens of God , deception of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> should thence ensue. And we praised you greatly for guarding, as became you, by suitable foresight against the snares of the ancient foe. But, since we have been informed that the religious lady Pompeiana is desirous of taking away the handmaidens of God from this same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and restoring them to their own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> whence they had been taken, and establishing there a congregation of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, it is necessary that if this be accomplished, the disposition of the deceased should in all respects be adhered to. But, if this should not be done, that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the testator may not seem to be entirely frustrated, we will that&mdash; inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the late abbot Urban, situated outside the city of Caralis, is said to be left so destitute that not even one <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> remains there&mdash; we will, I say, that John, whom the said Epiphanius appointed to be abbot in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which, as has been said, he had determined should be founded in his house, be ordained abbot (<em>i.e. of the late Urban's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a></em>), provided only that there be no impediment against him.</p>

<p>And let the relics which were to have been deposited in the house of the aforesaid Epiphanius  be deposited there, and let whatever the same Epiphanius had contributed for the intended <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in his own house be in all ways applied to the other; that so, even though for safeguard, as above written, his will is not carried out with regard to the place, the benefit intended may nevertheless be preserved inviolate. And indeed let your Fraternity, together with the guardian (<em>defensore</em>) Vitalis, arrange all this, and endeavour to order it so advantageously that you may have your reward, as for your praiseworthy prohibition, so also for your good settlement of the case. Lastly, though it may be superfluous to commend this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to your Fraternity, yet we abundantly exhort you that, as becomes you, with due regard to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, you hold it as commended to you .</p>
