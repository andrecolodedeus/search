<h1>Book XI, Letter 28</h1>

<p> <em>To Augustine, Bishop of the Angli</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Augustine, etc.</p>

<p> <em>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse14">Luke 2:14</a></span>; because a grain of wheat, falling into the earth, has died, that it might not reign in heaven alone; even He by whose death we live, by whose weakness we are made strong, by whose suffering we are rescued from suffering, through whose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we seek in Britain for brethren whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, by whose gift we find those whom without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> them we sought. But who can describe what great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> sprung up here in the hearts of all the faithful, for that the nation of the Angli through the operation of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> and the labour of your Fraternity has cast away the darkness of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and been suffused with the light of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; that with most sound mind it now tramples on the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> which it formerly crouched before in insane <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; that it falls down with pure heart before Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that it is restrained by the rules of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> preaching from the lapses of wrong doing; that it bows down in heart to divine precepts, that in understanding it may be exalted; that it humbles itself even to the earth in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, lest in mind and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> it should lie upon the earth. Whose is this work but His who says, <em>My Father works hitherto, and I work</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse17">John 5:17</a></span>? Who, to show that He converts the world, not by men's wisdom, but by His own power, chose unlettered men as His preachers whom He sent into the world? And He does the same even now, having deigned to work mighty works in the nation of the Angli through weak men. But in this heavenly gift, dearest brother, there is ground, along with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, for most serious <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> has displayed great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> through your Love in the nation which He has willed to be chosen. Wherefore you must needs <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for this same heavenly gift, and tremble in rejoicing:&mdash; <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, that is, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the Angli are drawn by outward <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> to inward <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but tremble, lest among the signs that are done the infirm mind lift itself up to presumption about itself, and from being exalted in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> outwardly, fall inwardly through vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For we ought to remember how, when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> returned with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> from preaching, and said to their heavenly Master, <em>Lord, in your name even the devils are subject unto us</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse17">Luke 10:17</a></span>, they straightway heard, <em>In this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> not; but rather <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> because your names are written in heaven</em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ib. 5:20). For they had set their minds on private and temporal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, when they rejoiced in the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. But they are recalled from private to common, from temporal to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, when it is said to them, <em>In this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> ye, because your names are written in heaven</em>. For not all the elect work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; and yet the names of all of them are kept enrolled in heaven. For to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Truth there should not be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, save for that good which they have in common with all, and in which they have no end to their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>.</p>

<p>It remains, therefore, dearest brother, that in the midst of the things which through the operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> you do outwardly, you should ever nicely judge yourself within, and nicely understand both what you are yourself and how great is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the midst of that same nation for the conversion of which you have received even the gift of doing signs. And if at any time you should remember having offended against our Creator, whether in tongue or in deed, ever recall these things to your memory, that memory of guilt may keep down the rising <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the heart. And whatsoever you may receive, or hast received, in the way of doing signs, regard these powers as not granted to yourself, but to those for whose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> they have been conferred upon you. Further, there occurs to my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, while I think on these things, what took place with one servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even one eminently chosen. Certainly <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when he led God's people out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, as your Fraternity <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, wrought wonderful <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Fasting forty days and nights in Mount Sina, he received the tables of the law; among lightnings and thunders, while all the people trembled, he was attached to the service of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being alone with Him even in familiar colloquy <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo030.htm">Exodus 30</a> and <a href="../bible/exo031.htm">31</a></span>; he opened a way through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>; he had a pillar of a cloud to lead him on his journey; to the people when an hungered he gave manna from heaven; flesh to those who longed for it he supplied in the wilderness by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, even unto overmuch satiety <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo013.htm">Exodus 13</a>, <a href="../bible/exo014.htm">14</a>, <a href="../bible/exo016.htm">16</a></span>. But, when in a time of drought they had come to the rock, he was distrustful, and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> being able to draw water from the same, which still at the Lord's command he opened without fail in copious streams. But how many and great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> after these he did during eight and thirty years in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> who can count or search out <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo017.htm">Exodus 17</a>; <a href="../bible/num020.htm">Numbers 20</a></span>? As often as a doubtful matter had troubled his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he resorted to the tabernacle, and enquired of the Lord in secret, and was immediately taught concerning it, God speaking to him <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm">Exodus 33</a> <em>seq.</em></span>. When the Lord was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> with the people, he appeased Him by the intervention of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; those who rose in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and dissented in discord he engulphed in the jaws of the gaping earth; he bore down his enemies with victories, and showed signs to his own people. But, when the land of promise had at length been reached, he was called into the mountain, and heard of the fault which he had committed eight and thirty years before, as I have said, in that he had <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> about drawing water from the rock. And for this reason he was told that he might not enter the land of promise <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/num027.htm">Numbers 27</a></span>. Herein it is for us to consider how formidable is the judgment of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who did so many signs through that servant of His whose fault He still bare in remembrance for so long a time.</p>

<p>Wherefore, dearest brother, if we find that even he whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have been especially chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> died for a fault after so many signs, with what <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> ought we to tremble, who do not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether we are chosen?</p>

<p>But what should I say of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the reprobate, when your Fraternity well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what the Truth says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; <em>Many shall come in that day saying to me, Lord in your name we have prophesied, and in your name have cast out devils, and in your name have done many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>. But I will say unto them, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not who you are: depart from me all you workers of iniquity</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse22">Matthew 7:22</a>; <a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse27">Luke 13:27</a></span>? The <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, then, should be much kept down in the midst of signs and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, lest haply one seek therein one's own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and exult in private <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for one's own exaltation. For through signs gains of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> should be sought, and His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by whose power these very signs are done. But there is one sign that the Lord has given us for which we may exceedingly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of election in ourselves, seeing that He says, <em>In this shall it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that you are my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if you have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one to another</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse35">John 13:35</a></span>. Which sign the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> demanded, when he said, <em>Make with me, Lord, a sign for good, that they which <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> me may see it, and be confounded</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse17">Psalm 85:17</a></span>.</p>

<p>These things I say, because I desire to abase the mind of my hearer in humility. But let your very humility have its confidence. For I, a sinner, maintain a most certain hope that through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of our Almighty Creator and Redeemer, our God and Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are already remitted, and you are chosen for this purpose, that those of others may be remitted through you. Nor will you have sorrow for any guilt in the future, while you strive to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in heaven for the conversion of many. Truly the same our Maker and Redeemer, speaking of the repentance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, says, <em>Verily I say unto you there will be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in heaven over one sinner that <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a>, more than over ninety and nine just <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, which need no repentance</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse7">Luke 15:7</a></span>. And if for one penitent there is great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in heaven, of what kind may we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to be for so large a people, converted from its <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, which, coming to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, has condemned by penitence the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things it did. In this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, then, of heaven and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> let us repeat the very words of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with which we began: let us say therefore, let us all say, <em>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will</em>.</p>
