<h1>Book XI, Letter 29</h1>

<p> <em>To Bertha, Queen of the Angli</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Bertha, etc.</p>

<p>They who desire, after earthly dominion, to obtain the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of a heavenly kingdom ought to labour earnestly to bring in gain to their Creator, that they may be able to rise by the steps of their operation to the things they long for; as we are glad to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you do. For indeed our most beloved son Laurentius the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and Peter the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, have brought us word on their return to us how your Glory has exhibited itself towards our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Augustine, and how great succour and what charity you have bestowed upon him. And we bless Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has been mercifully pleased to reserve the conversion of the nation of the Angli for your reward. For, as through Helena of illustrious memory, the mother of the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor Constantine, He kindled the hearts of the Romans into <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so we trust that He works in the nation of the Angli through the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of your Glory. And indeed you ought before now, as being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, to have inclined the heart of our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> son, your husband, by the good influence of your <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, to follow, for the good of his kingdom and of his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which you profess, to the end that for him, and for the conversion of the whole nation through him, fit retribution might accrue to you in the joys of heaven. For seeing, as we have said, that your Glory is both fortified by a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> and instructed in letters, this should have been to you neither slow of accomplishment nor difficult. And since, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, now is a suitable time, so proceed, with the co-operation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, as to be able to make reparation with increase for what has been neglected. Wherefore strengthen by continual hortation the mind of your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> husband in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; let your solicitude infuse into him increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so kindle his heart even for the fullest conversion of the nation subject to him that both he may offer, out of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of your devotion, a great <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the Almighty Lord, and that the things related of you may both grow and be in all ways <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: for your good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not only among the Romans, who have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> earnestly for your life, but also through various places, and have come even to the ears of the most serene prince at Constantinople. Hence, as great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> has been caused us by the consolations of your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, so also may there be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in heaven for your perfected work. So acquit yourselves devotedly and with all your might in aid of our above-named most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and of the servants of God whom we have sent to you, in the conversion of your nation that you may both reign happily here with our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> son your husband, and after long courses of years may also attain the joys of the future life, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no end. Now we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that He would both kindle the heart of your Glory with the fire of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to perform what we have spoken of, and grant you the fruit of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward for work well-pleasing to Him.</p>
