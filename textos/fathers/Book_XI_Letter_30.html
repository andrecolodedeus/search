<h1>Book XI, Letter 30</h1>

<p> <em>To Venantius, Ex-Monk, Patrician of Syracuse</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Venantius, etc.</p>

<p>In addressing to you the greeting which is due I was intending to speak of what I suffer. But I think I need not relate to you what you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For I am tormented by pains of gout, which, afflicting not dissimilarly both me and you, while they increase upon us exceedingly, have caused our life to decrease. In the midst of them what else should we do but recall our faults to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>? For we who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in many things from the pampering of the flesh are purged by the affliction of the flesh. We are to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that present pain, if it converts the mind of the afflicted one, is the end of preceding guilt; but, if it does not convert to the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, is the beginning of pain to follow. We must therefore take care, and in entire conversion of heart watch to the utmost of our power with tears, lest we pass from torment to torments. We are also to consider by how great a dispensation of loving kindness our Maker deals with us, in that He continually smites us, who are worthy of death, and still slays us not. For He threatens what He will do, and yet does it not, that pains sent in advance may alarm us, and, when we are converted to the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the strict Judge, may shield us from His animadversion when life is over. For who may tell, who may count, how many, sunk in their lechery, running headlong also in <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, continuing in robberies and iniquities even to the day of their death, have so lived in this world as never to suffer even a headache, but by a sudden stroke have been delivered to the fires of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>? We, then, have a token that we are not forsaken, in that we are continually scourged, according to the testimony of Scripture, which says, <em>Whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews 12:6</a></span>. Wherefore under the very stripes of God let us recall to mind both His gifts and the losses of our guilt. Let us consider what <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things He has showered upon our ill-doing, and what ill things we have committed under His goodness. Let us fulfil what the Lord says through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <em>Put me in remembrance, that we may plead together</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse26">Isaiah 43:26</a></span>. Let us plead now in our thought with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we be not hereafter strictly judged by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For what says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? <em>If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged of the Lord</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 11:31</a></span>. Whosoever, then, would make haste to escape the strictness of the sentence of the judgment to come, let him, through the bitterness of penitence, cut off for himself all the sweetness of the present life. Moreover, whatever gifts of this kind there are, whose gifts are they but our Maker's? But that should not be accounted a gift of God fully to us which separates us through delight in itself from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; lest we should prefer the things given to the Giver, and while receiving <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, though ourselves <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, we should be disjoined from His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> by that whereby we ought to have grown in His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Now may the Creator of all things, that is Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, pour into your heart by the inspiration of His Spirit what we speak to you of by letter, and cleanse you from all defilements of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and grant you the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of His comfort here, and hereafter <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rewards with Himself. I beg that my most sweet daughters, the lady Barbara and the lady Antonina, be greeted in my name.</p>
