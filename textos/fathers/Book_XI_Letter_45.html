<h1>Book XI, Letter 45</h1>

<p> <em>To Theoctista, Patrician</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Theoctista, etc.</p>

<p>We ought to give great thanks to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and most benignant Emperors have near them kinsfolk of their race, whose life and conversation is such as to give us all great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Hence too we should continually <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for these our lords, that their life, with that of all who belong to them, may by the protection of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be preserved through long and tranquil times.</p>

<p>I have to inform you, however, that I have learned from the report of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> how that, owing to the levity of the people, a tumult of detraction has arisen against you. And I hear that your Excellency has consequently been distressed with no slight vexation. If this is so, I wonder much why the words of men on earth should agitate you, who have fixed your heart on heaven. For the blessed Job, when his friends who had come to console him had broken out into rebuke, said, <em>For behold my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is in heaven, and he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> me is on high</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job016.htm#verse20">Job 16:20</a></span>. For one who has the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of his life in heaven ought not to be afraid of the judgments of men on earth. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also, a leader of good men, says, <em>Our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is this, the testimony of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse12">2 Corinthians 1:12</a></span>. And he says again, <em>Let every man prove his own work, and so shall he have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in himself, and not in another</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse4">Galatians 6:4</a></span>. For, if we are rejoiced by praises and broken down by detractions, we have set our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> not in ourselves, but in the mouth of others. And indeed the foolish <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> took no oil in their vessels, but the wise ones took oil in their vessels with their lamps <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm">Matthew 25</a></span>. Now our lamps are good works; of which it is written, <em>Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew 5:16</a></span>. And we then take oil in our vessels with our lamps, when we seek not the splendour of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for our good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> from the adulation of our neighbours, but preserve it in the testimony of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. And in regard to all that is said of us outwardly we ought to recur to the secrets of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Although all should revile us, yet he is free whom <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> accuses not, while, even though all should praise, one cannot be free, if <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> accuses him. Whence the Truth says concerning John, <em>What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse7">Matthew 11:7</a></span>. And this in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is said in the way of negation, not of assertion, since it is added, <em>But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses</em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ibid. 8). For although, according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, John was clothed in rough raiment, yet the signification is that they wear soft clothing who are delighted by adulations and praises. And it is denied that John was a reed shaken with the wind, inasmuch as no breath from any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mouth bent the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. For we, if we are lifted up by praises, or cast down by revilings, are a reed shaken with the wind. But far be this, far be it from the heart of your Excellency. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you read studiously the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who says, <em>I, if I yet pleased men, should not be the servant of Christ</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse10">Galatians 1:10</a></span>.</p>

<p>If, however, any even slight sadness has arisen in your mind from this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> has kindly allowed this to be the case. For not even to His elect in this life has He promised the joys of delight, but the bitternesses of tribulation; so that, after the manner of medicine, they may be restored through a bitter cup to the sweetness of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For what says He? <em>The world shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and you shall lament</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse20">John 16:20</a></span>. With what hope? With what promise? A little afterwards it is added, <em>I will see you again, and your heart shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> no man shall take from you</em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ibid. 22). Hence again He says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <em>In your patience shall you possess your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse19">Luke 21:19</a></span>.</p>

<p>Consider, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, where patience would be, if there were nothing to be endured. I suspect that there is no Abel without having a Cain for his brother. For if the good were without the bad, they could not be perfectly good, since they would not be purged: and the very society of the bad is the purgation of the good. There were three sons of Noe in the ark, one of whom was a derider of his father, who, though in himself he was blessed, still received a sentence of condemnation in his son. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had two sons before he took Cethura to wife; and yet his carnal son <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the son of promise <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen009.htm">Genesis 9</a></span>. This the great teacher expounds, saying, <em>As he who is after the flesh <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> him that is after the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, even so it is now</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse29">Galatians 4:29</a></span>. Isaac had two sons; but one, who was spiritual, fled before the threats of his carnal brother. Jacob had twelve sons, but one, who lived uprightly, was sold by ten into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. In the case of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David, because there was in him what should have been purged, it was brought to pass that he suffered under a son's <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The blessed Job says of the society of the reprobate, <em>I have been a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job030.htm#verse29">Job 30:29</a></span>. To Ezekiel the Lord says, <em><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, unbelievers and destroyers are with you, and you dwell among scorpions</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze002.htm#verse6">Ezekiel 2:6</a></span>. Among the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> there was one reprobate, that there might be one by whose <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> the eleven might be tried. The Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> speaks thus to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <em>He delivered just <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a></em>,  <em>oppressed by the injury and conversation of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For in seeing and hearing he was just, dwelling among those who from day to day vexed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the just one with their unrighteous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse7">2 Peter 2:7-8</a></span>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also the apostle writes to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, saying, <em>In the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world, holding fast the word of life</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse15">Philippians 2:15</a></span>.</p>

<p>Seeing then that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Scripture that in this life the good cannot be without the bad, your Excellency ought by no means to be disturbed by the voices of fools, especially as there is then sure confidence in Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when for well-doing any adversity is given us in this world in order that a full reward may be reserved for us in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> retribution. Whence also in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the Truth says, <em>Blessed shall you be when men shall say all manner of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> for my name's sake</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse11">Matthew 5:11</a></span>. And for our consolation He deigned to adduce as an example His own reproaches, saying, <em>If they have called the master of the house <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, how much more them of his household</em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ibid. 10:25).</p>

<p>But there are many who perhaps praise the life of the good more than they ought; and, lest any elation should creep in from praise, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> allows bad men to break out into <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> and objurgation, in order that, if any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> springs up in the heart from the mouth of them that praise, it may be choked by the mouth of them that revile. Hence it is, then, that the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> testifies that he continues in his preaching <em>through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report and good report</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse8">2 Corinthians 6:8</a></span>; saying also, <em>As deceivers and yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</em> If then there were such as laid an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report on <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and called him a deceiver, what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> now should account it a hard thing in behalf of Christ to hear injurious words? Moreover we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of how great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was the precursor of our Redeemer, who in Holy Writ is called not only more than a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, but even an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: and yet, as the history of his death testifies, after his death his body was burnt by his persecutors . But why say we these things of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men? Let us speak of the Holy of holies Himself, that is of God Who was made man for us, Who before His death heard the injurious charge that He had a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and after His death was called a deceiver by His persecutors, when one said, <em>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that that deceiver said, After three days I will rise again</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse63">Matthew 27:63</a></span>. How much, then, must we sinners needs bear from the tongues and hands of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, we who are to be judged at the coming of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Judge, if He Who will even come as Judge endured so much both before and after His death?</p>

<p>These things, most sweet and excellent daughter, I have briefly said, lest, as often as you hear of foolish men speaking in derogation of you, you should be touched by even the least sadness of heart. But, seeing that this very murmuring of foolish men cannot be allayed by quiet reason, I hold it to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if the doing of what can be done is neglected. For, when we appease insane minds, and bring them back to a healthy state, we ought by no means to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them offense. For there are some offenses that are to be altogether despised; but there are some which, when they can be avoided without guilt, are not to be despised, lest there be guilt in keeping them alive. We learn this from the preaching of the sacred <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; since, when the Truth said, <em>Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse11">Matthew 15:11</a></span>, and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> replied saying, <em>Do you <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> were offended after they heard this saying?</em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ibid. 12), straightway He replied, <em>Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up. Let them alone; they be blind, and leaders of the blind</em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ibid. 13). And yet, when tribute was demanded, He first gave a reason why tribute should not be paid, and immediately subjoined, <em>Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first comes up; and when you have opened his mouth, you shall find a stater. That take, and give unto them for me and for you</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse26">Matthew 17:26</a></span>. Why is it that of some who were offended it is said, <em>Let them alone; they are blind, and leaders of the blind;</em> and that to others, lest they should be offended, tribute is paid by the Lord, even though not due? Why is it that He allowed one offense to remain, but forbade another to be caused to others? Why, but that He might teach us on the one hand to despise offenses which implicate us in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but on the other to mitigate in all ways those which we can appease without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</p>

<p>Wherefore your Excellency, God protecting you, may, with great quietness, turn aside the offenses of bad men. For the chief of them you should of your own accord call to you privately and give them reasons, and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> certain wrong points which they suppose to be held by you. And if too, as it is said may be the case, they suspect such <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> to be insincere, you should confirm it even by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, averring that you do not hold, and never have held, those points. Nor let it seem beneath you to satisfy them in such a way; nor let there be in your mind any feeling of disdain against them on account of your imperial race. For we are all brethren created by the power of one Emperor, and redeemed by His blood. And so we ought not in anything to despise our brethren, however poor and abject.</p>

<p>For certainly Peter had received power in the heavenly kingdom, so that whatever he should bind or loose on earth should be bound or loosed in heaven; he walked on the sea, he healed the sick with his shadow, he slew sinners with his word, he raised the dead by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> And because by the admonition of the Spirit he had gone in to Cornelius the Gentile, a question was raised against him by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> as to why he had gone in among <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and eaten with them, and why he had received them in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And yet this first of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, filled with such gifts of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, supported by such power of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, replied to the complaint of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, not by power but by reason, and explained the case to them in order; how he saw a certain vessel, as it had been a sheet, in which were four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air, let down from heaven, and heard a voice saying, <em>Arise, Peter; kill and eat</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse5">Acts 11:5</a> <em>seq.</em></span>; how three men came to him calling him to Cornelius; how the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> bade him go with them; how the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> who had been wont to come on those <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, came on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For if, when he was blamed by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, he had paid regard to the authority which he had received in Holy Church, he might have replied that the sheep should not dare to find fault with the shepherd to whom they had been committed. But, had he said anything of his own power in answer to the complaint of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, he would not have been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a teacher of gentleness. He pacified them, therefore, by giving a reason humbly, and even produced witnesses to defend him from blame, saying, <em>Moreover these six brethren accompanied me</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse12">Acts 11:12</a></span>. If, then, the pastor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Prince of the Apostles, who singularly did signs and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, disdained not, in defending himself from blame, humbly to give a reason, how much more ought we sinners, when we are blamed for anything, to pacify those who blame us by giving a reason humbly!</p>

<p>For to me, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, when I was resident at the footsteps of my lords in the royal city, many used to come of those who were accused with respect to the aforesaid points. But I declare, my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bearing me <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that I never found in them any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, any pravity, or anything of what was said against them. Whence also I took care, despising report, to receive them familiarly, and rather to defend them from their accusers. For it used to be said against them that under pretext of religion they dissolved marriages; and that they said that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> did not entirely take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and that, if any one did penance for three years for his iniquities, he might afterwards live perversely; and that, if they said under compulsion that they <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> anything for which they were blamed, they were by no means holden by the bond of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. Now if there are any who undoubtedly hold and maintain such views, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they are not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. And such both I, and all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the universal Church, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a>, because they think what is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and speak what is contrary. For, if they say that marriages should be dissolved for the sake of religion , be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that, though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> law has conceded this, yet divine law has forbidden it. For the Truth in person says, <em>What God has joined together let not man put asunder</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse6">Matthew 19:6</a></span>. He says also, <em>It is not lawful for a man to <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife saving for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fornication</em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ibid. 9). Who then may contradict this heavenly legislator? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how it is written, <em>Two shall be one flesh</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse5">Matthew 19:5</a>; <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis 2:24</a></span>. If, then, a man and wife are one flesh, and a man puts away his wife for the sake of religion, or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> her husband while he remains in this world, even though perchance he turns aside to unlawful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, what is this conversion , in which one and the same flesh on the one part passes to continence and on the other part remains in pollution? If, however, it should suit both to lead a continent life, who may dare to accuse them, since it is certain that Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has granted what is less, has not forbidden what is greater? And indeed we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have both previously led continent lives with their consorts, and have afterwards passed over to the rules of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church. For in two ways <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men are accustomed to abstain even from lawful things. Sometimes that they may increase their merits before Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but sometimes that they may wipe away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their former life. For when the three children who were brought under <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the Babylonian King, asked for pulse for food, being unwilling to make use of the king's meat, it was not because it would have been <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in them to eat what God had created. They were unwilling, then, to take what it was lawful for them to take, that their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> might increase through continence. But David, who had taken to himself another man's wife, and had been sorely scourged for his fault, desired long afterwards to drink water from the cistern of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>; which when his bravest soldiers had brought to him, he refused to drink it, and poured it out as a libation to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. For it was lawful for him to drink it, had he been so minded; but, because he remembered having done what was unlawful, he laudably abstained even from what was lawful. And he, who to his guilt previously feared not that the blood of dying soldiers should be shed, afterwards considered that, were he to drink the water, he would have shed the blood of living soldiers, saying, <em>Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ch011.htm#verse19">1 Chronicles 11:19</a></span>? Accordingly, when good husbands and wives desire either to increase merit or to do away with the faults of previous life, it is lawful for them to bind themselves to continence and to aspire to a better life. But, if the wife does not follow after the continence which the husband aspires to, or the husband refuses that which the wife aspires to, it is not lawful for wedlock to be cut asunder, seeing that it is written, <em>The wife has not power of her own body, but the husband; and the husband has not power of his own body, but the wife</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 7:4</a></span>.</p>

<p>But, if there are any who say that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are only superficially put away in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, what can be more against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than such preaching, whereby they would fain undo the very sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, wherein principally the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is bound to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of heavenly cleanness, that, being completely absolved from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it may cleave to Him alone of Whom the Prophet says, <em>But it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to cleave to God</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse28">Psalm 72:28</a></span> ? For certainly the passage of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> was a figure of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in which the enemies behind died, but others were found in front in the wilderness. And so to all who are bathed in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> all their past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted, since their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> die behind them even as did the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> enemies. But in the wilderness we find other enemies, since, while we live in this life, before reaching the country of promise, many <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> harass us, and hasten to bar our way as we are wending to the land of the living. Whosoever says, then, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not entirely put away in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, let him say that the Egyptians did not really die in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>. But, if he acknowledges that the Egyptians really died, he must needs acknowledge that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> die entirely in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, since surely the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> avails more in our absolution than the shadow of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the Lord says, <em>He that is washed needs not to wash, but is clean every whit</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse10">John 13:10</a></span>. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not entirely put away in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, how is he that is washed clean every whit? For he cannot be said to be clean every whit, if he has any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remaining. But no one can resist the voice of the Truth, <em>He that is washed is clean every whit.</em> Nothing, then, of the contagion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remains to him whom He Himself who redeemed him declares to be clean every whit.</p>

<p>But, if there are any who say that penance is to be done for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> during any three years, and that after the three years one may live in pleasures, these <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> neither the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor the precepts of sacred Scripture. Against these the excellent preacher says, <em>He that sows in his flesh shall of the flesh also reap corruption</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse8">Galatians 6:8</a></span>. Against these he says again, <em>They that are in the flesh cannot please God</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse8">Romans 8:8</a></span>; where he subjoins to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <em>But you are not in the flesh, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</em></p>

<p>Now they are in the flesh who live in carnal pleasures. Against them it is said, <em>Neither shall corruption possess incorruption</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse50">1 Corinthians 15:50</a></span>. But, if they say that a short season of penitence may suffice against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that one may be allowed to return again to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, rightly does the sentence of the first pastor hit them, when he says, <em>It is happened unto them according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> proverb; The dog is turned to his own vomit again, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse22">2 Peter 2:22</a></span>. For great is the efficacy of penitence against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but only if one persevere in this penitence. For it is written, <em>He that shall persevere unto the end, the same shall be saved</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse22">Matthew 10:22</a> and <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse13">24:13</a></span>. Hence again it is written, <em>He that is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> from a dead body, and touches it again, what avails his washing?</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse30">Sirach 34:30</a></span> . Now a dead body is every perverse work, which draws a man to death, because he lives not in the life of righteousness. He, then, is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> from a dead body, and again touches it, who deplores the bad works which he remembers having done, but after his tears entangles himself in the same again. Washing, therefore, from such dead body avails not any <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that does again what it has bemoaned, and rises not through the lamentations of penitence to the rectitude of righteousness. For to do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is not only to bemoan what has been committed, but also to decline from what has been bemoaned.</p>

<p>But, if there are any who say that, if any one shall have <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematised</a> anything under compulsion of necessity, he is not held by the bond of the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, these are themselves witnesses that they are no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. For they think by vain attempts to loose the binding of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, and hereby neither do they account as real the absolution of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church which she offers to the faithful, if they think that her binding is of no avail. Against such as these dispute should be no longer held, since they ought to be altogether scorned and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematised</a>; and whence they think to elude the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, thence let them in reality be bound in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>If, then, there are any who under the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name dare either to preach, or to hold silently in their own minds, the points of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which we have spoken of above, these undoubtedly we both have <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematised</a> and do <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematise</a>. Yet, as I have said before, in those who used to come to me in the royal city I observed no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> at all as to any one of the aforesaid points, nor do I think there was any. For, if there had been, I should have observed it. However, since there are many of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who are inflamed with unwise <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and often, while they attack certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as though they were <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, themselves make <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, consideration should be had for their infirmity, and, as I have said before, they should be appeased with reason and gentleness. For indeed they are like those of whom it is written, <em>I bear them record, that they have a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse2">Romans 10:2</a></span>. Wherefore your Excellency, who live incessantly in reading, in tears, and in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, should, as I have requested, appease their unwisdom by gentle exhortations and replies, that not only in yourself, but also in them, you may find the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> retribution. All this my exceeding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has induced me to say to you, since I think that your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is my gain, and your sadness my loss. May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> guard you with heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and, keeping safe the Piety of our lord and the Tranquillity of our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lady, prolong your life for the education of the little lords.</p>
