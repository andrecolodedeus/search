<h1>Book XI, Letter 46</h1>

<p> <em>To Isacius, Bishop of Jerusalem</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Isacius, etc.</p>

<p>In keeping with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of history, what means the fact that at the time of the flood the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> outside the ark dies, but within the ark is preserved unto life, but what we see plainly now, namely that all the unfaithful perish under the wave of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while the unity of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, like the compactness of the ark, keeps her faithful ones in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in charity? And this ark in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is compacted of incorruptible timber, since it is built of strong <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and such as persevere in good. And, when any single person is converted from a secular life, timber is, as it were, still cut down from the mountains. But when, according to the order of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, one is assigned to have custody of others, it is as though the ark were built of timber sawn and put together for preserving the life of men. And in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that ark, when the flood was over, rested on a mountain, because when the corruption of this life is over, when the billows of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works have passed away, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church will rest in the heavenly country, as on a high mountain. To the building, therefore, of this ark we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to find, after reading your Fraternity's epistle, that in the compactness of a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> you lend your aid; and we render great thanks to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, though the pastors of His flock are changed, keeps the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which He once delivered to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, even after them unchangeable. Now the excellent preacher says, <em>Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 3:11</a></span>. Whosoever, then, with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his neighbour, holds firmly the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he has laid the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and man, as a foundation for himself from the Father. It is to be hoped, then, that, where Christ is the foundation, the building also of good works may follow. The Truth itself also in person says, <em>He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse1">John 10:1</a></span>. And a little afterwards He adds, I am the door. He, then, enters into the sheepfold by the door who enters by Christ. And he enters by Christ who thinks and preaches what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> concerning the same Creator and Redeemer of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, keeps what he preaches, and undertakes the topmost place of government with a view to a burdensome office, not in desire of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of transitory dignity. He watches also wisely over the charge of the sheepfold which he has taken in hand, lest either perverse men speaking forwardly tear the sheep of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or malignant spirits waste them by persuading them to vicious delights.</p>

<p>But in all these things may He instruct us Who for our sake was made man. May He Who vouchsafed to become what He made Himself infuse the spirit of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> both into my infirmity and your charity, and open the eye of our heart in all carefulness and watchful circumspection.</p>

<p>But that men of a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> are advanced to sacred orders, thanks should be given without cease to the same Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should ever be made for the life of our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> lord the Emperor, and for his most tranquil spouse, and his most gentle offspring, in whose times the mouths of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are silent, since, though their hearts seethe in the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of perverse opinion, yet in the time of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Emperor they presume not to speak out the wrong opinions which they hold; so that we plainly see fulfilled what is written, <em>Gathering the waters of the sea together as in a bottle</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa032.htm#verse7">Psalm 32:7</a></span> . For the water of the sea is gathered together as in a bottle, because whatever wrong opinions the bitter science of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> entertains at the present day it keeps within the breast, and presumes not to express them openly. But your Fraternity, spiritually taught, has set forth in all respects the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, and has thoroughly declared the things that should be sought after. Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, therefore, is ours. We hold what you say, and say what you hold.</p>

<p>But, inasmuch as it has come to our ears that in the Churches of the East no one attains to sacred orders but by giving of <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>, if your Fraternity finds that this is the case, you should offer as your first oblation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> the restraining of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the Churches subject to you. For, not to speak of other things, what sort of men can they be when in sacred orders who are advanced to them not by merit but by <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>? Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with what animadversion the Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> attacked this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, having pronounced the first sentence of condemnation against Simon, when he said, <em>Your money be with you unto perdition, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse20">Acts 8:20</a></span>. Our Lord God Himself also, the Creator and Redeemer of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, having made a scourge of small cords, overthrew and cast out of the temple the seats of them that sold doves <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm">Matthew 21</a></span>. For to sell doves in the temple, what else is it but to give for a price in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church that imposition of hands whereby the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is given? But the seats of them that sold doves were overthrown, because the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of such is not accounted as <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, I have been informed that in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is called Neas, strifes often arise with your Church in the city of Jerusalem. Wherefore your Holiness ought carefully to consider all things, and to correct some things gently, but bear others that cannot be corrected with equanimity. For we see plainly what is said by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church through the voice of the Psalmist, <em>Sinners have built upon my back</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa128.htm#verse3">Psalm 128:3</a></span> . For on the back burdens are borne. Sinners, then, build upon our back, when we bear with sufferance those whom we cannot correct. For the steersman of a ship, when he considers that the wind is against him, surmounts some billows by steering right over them, but some which he foresees cannot be surmounted he prudently avoids by turning his course aside. So, therefore, let your Holiness mitigate some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> by repressing them, and others by bearing them, so as in all respects to conserve the peace of them that dwell together in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church of Jerusalem. For it is written, <em>Follow peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, without which no man shall see God</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse14">Hebrews 12:14</a></span>. For in quarrels the very light of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the light of good intent, is blocked. Whence the Psalmist says, <em>My eye is troubled because of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa006.htm#verse8">Psalm 6:8</a></span>. And what remains in us of well-doing, if we lose peace from the heart, without which we cannot see the Lord? Do you therefore so act as to gather the gain of your reward even from those who through strife might have caused it to perish. May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> guard your Love with heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and grant you to carry with you from those who are committed to you manifold fruit and measure running over to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> joys.</p>
