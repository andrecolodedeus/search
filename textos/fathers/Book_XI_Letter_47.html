<h1>Book XI, Letter 47</h1>

<p> <em>To Anatolius, Deacon at Constantinople.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Anatolius, etc.</p>

<p>Your Love has written to me that our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord orders a successor to be appointed to my most reverend brother John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Prima Justiniana, on account of the ailment of the head from which he suffers, lest perchance that city, while without the jurisdiction of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, should be ruined by its enemies, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid. And yet the canons nowhere enjoin that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be superseded on account of sickness. And it is altogether <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> that, if bodily ailments come on, the sick person should be deprived of his dignity . Accordingly this thing can by no means be done through us, lest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should come upon my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from his deposition. But it is to be suggested that, if he who bears rule is sick, an administrator may be found, to undertake all his charge, and maintain and fill his place, without his being deposed, in the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and custody of the city; so that neither may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> be offended nor the city be found to be neglected. If, however, the same most reverend John should haply on account of his ailments request to be relieved from the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, it should be conceded on his presenting a petition in writing. But otherwise we are altogether unable, with due regard to the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to do this thing. But, if he should be unwilling thus to make petition, what pleases the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor, whatever he commands to be done, is in his power. As he determines, so let him provide. Only let him not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us to be mixed up in the deposition of one so situated. Still, what he does, if it is canonical, we will follow. But, if it is not canonical, we will bear it, so far as we can without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our own.</p>
