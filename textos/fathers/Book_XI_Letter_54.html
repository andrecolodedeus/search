<h1>Book XI, Letter 54</h1>

<p> <em>To Desiderius, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a></em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Desiderius, etc.</p>

<p>Many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things having been reported to us with regard to your pursuits, such <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> arose in our heart that we could not bear to refuse what your Fraternity had requested to have granted to you. But it afterwards came to our ears, what we cannot mention without shame, that your Fraternity is in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of expounding grammar to certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. This thing we took so much amiss, and so strongly disapproved it, that we changed what had been said before into groaning and sadness, since the praises of Christ cannot find room in one mouth with the praises of Jupiter. And consider yourself what a grave and heinous offense it is for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to sing what is not becoming even for a religious <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. And, though our most beloved son Candidus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, having been, when he came to us, strictly examined on this matter, denied it, and endeavoured to excuse you, yet still the thought has not departed from our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that in proportion as it is execrable for such a thing to be related of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, it ought to be ascertained by strict and veracious evidence whether or not it be so. Whence, if hereafter what has been reported to us should prove evidently to be false, and it should be clear that you do not apply yourself to trifles and secular literature, we shall give thanks to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has not permitted your heart to be stained with the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> praises of the abominable; and we will treat without misgiving or hesitation concerning the granting of what you request.</p>

<p>We commend to you in all respects the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> whom together with our most beloved son Laurentius the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and Mellitus the abbot we have sent to our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Augustine, that, through the succour of your Fraternity, no delay may stop their onward progress.</p>
