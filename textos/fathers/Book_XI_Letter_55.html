<h1>Book XI, Letter 55</h1>

<p> <em>To Virgilius, Bishop of Arelate (Arles</em>) .</p>

<p>Gregory to Virgilius, etc.</p>

<p>Since by the testimony of Holy Writ <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> is called the service of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, with what earnestness it ought to be banished from the temple of God is acknowledged; and yet (we say it with groaning) by some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> this is not regarded. For fierce cupidity holds the heart captive, and persuades one that what it commands is lawful, and so proceeds as to slay with the same sword both the giver and the receiver. What safe place, then, can hereafter be of avail against <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> is opened to it by bad <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>? How can he keep the sheepfolds inviolate who invites the wolf to enter? Alas for shame! He pollutes his hands by an unlawful <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a>, and thinks to lift up others by his benediction, while himself prostrate under his own iniquity, and captive notwithstanding to his own ambition. Since then this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of rapacity has never entered the citadel of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and you say that you have your hands unpolluted in the matter of ordinations, give thanks to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and acknowledge yourselves to be His debtors in that under His protection you have remained unharmed by the contagion of this disease. But this good in you will profit you less than it might have done if you have not carefully forbidden this thing in others also. As in yourself this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> had displeased you, you ought to have been <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> against it in your brother also. For, seeing that the divine precepts admonish us to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our neighbours as ourselves, it is no small fault to disregard them, and not to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for others what for ourselves we shrink from. Even now, therefore, most beloved brother, give your mind to repairing what you have lost in others through your negligence in correction, and restrain whomsoever you can from this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and insist on a synod being assembled for rooting out this same <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, to the end that, with reward to your Love, what shall have been condemned, God granting it, by the ordinance of all may be better guarded against by all.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it has come to our ears that our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Serenus of Massilia (<em>Marseilles</em>), receives bad men into his intimate society, so as to have, in fine, as his familiar friend a certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. who, after lapse, is said to wallow still in his iniquities. This you ought to enquire into closely. And, if it should prove to be so, let it be your care so to correct this matter in our stead that both he who has received such a one may learn not to encourage him by familiarity, but rather to constrain him by punishment, and he who has been received may learn to wash away his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with tears, and not to pile up iniquity by unclean living. Let your Fraternity hold as commended to you in all respects the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> whom we have sent to our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Augustine, and take pains so to succour them for proceeding on their way, and so to concur with them, that through your assistance they may be able, under the protection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to arrive speedily at their destination.</p>
