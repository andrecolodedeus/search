<h1>Book XI, Letter 59</h1>

<p> <em>To Theoderic, King of the Franks</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Theoderic, etc.</p>

<p>The letter of your Excellency, which is the index of your heart, has so shown, in its flow of lucid language, what great <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is conspicuous in you, along with royal power, that there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of whatever fame has reported in your praise. And inasmuch as you signify, by what you say in praise of it, that our exhortation has so pleased your royal mind that you wish whatever you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to pertain to the worship of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the veneration of Churches, or to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to be both carefully established and in all ways guarded, we appeal to you with a renewed exhortation, with a view to your greater reward, that you would order a synod to be assembled, and, as we have before written, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> corporal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the pravity of simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to be condemned by the definition of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and to be cut off within the limits of your kingdom, and allow not any longer money to have more effect than the precepts of the Lord. For, since all <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> is the service of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, whosoever does not watchfully guard against it, and especially in the bestowal of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> honours, is subjected to the perdition of infidelity, even though he may seem to hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he disregards. As, then, against external enemies, so also against adversaries of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> among yourselves, take ye earnest heed, that on account of this your faithful opposition to God's enemies you may both reign prosperously here under His protection, and also come hereafter by the leading of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> joys.</p>

<p>Furthermore, what benefits your Excellence bestowed on our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Augustine on his progress to the nation of the Angli we have been told by certain <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who have returned to us from him. Wherefore, returning abundant thanks, we beg that you will deign to afford your support in full measure to these <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> also who have been sent to him, and to aid them on their onward journey, so that the more amply you show your kindness to them, the greater return you may expect from Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom they serve.</p>
