<h1>Book XI, Letter 60</h1>

<p> <em>To Theodebert, King of the Franks</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Theodebert, etc.</p>

<p>One who receives with willing mind and embraces in the bosom of his heart words of fatherly admonition declares himself without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to be one who would be an amender of faults. On which account the absolute promise of your Excellence assures us sufficiently. For we hold in place of a pledge the words of one who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for payment. Therefore let your Excellency vouchsafe, adhering to the commands of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to give <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> attention to the assembling of a synod, that every corporal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which was the first to arise in Churches from iniquitous ambition, may under threat of the censure of your power be removed by the definition of a council, and be cut off by the roots; lest, if gold is loved in your parts more than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He who now remains tranquil while His precepts are despised be felt hereafter to be wrathful in vengeance. And indeed, because we say all this for your own behoof, we therefore cease not to press you again and again, that we may be able, even by importunity, to do good to our most excellent and most sweet sons. For it will be in all respects of advantage to your kingdom, if what is done in those parts against God be corrected by the emendation of your Excellency.</p>

<p>Furthermore, what good service your Excellency did to our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Augustine on his progress to the nation of the Angli we have learned from the report of certain <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who returned to us from him. Rendering you the greatest thanks for this, we beg you to bestow your benefits abundantly on the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the bearers of these presents, whom we have sent to our said brother, to the end that, while under your patronage, they find no difficulties in your parts, but accomplish easily with the help of Christ the journey they have undertaken, you may reap your richer fruit of reward before the eyes of our God.</p>
