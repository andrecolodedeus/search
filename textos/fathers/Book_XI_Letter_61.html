<h1>Book XI, Letter 61</h1>

<p> <em>To Clotaire, King of the Franks</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Clotaire, etc.</p>

<p>Among so many cares and anxieties which you sustain for the government of the peoples under your sway, it is to your exceeding praise and great reward that you are helpers of those who labour in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, since you have shown yourselves by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things you have already done to be such that we may presume still better things of you, we are moved most gladly to request of you what will be to your own reward. Now certain <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who had proceeded with our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Augustine to the nation of the Angli, have returned and told us with what great charity your Excellence refreshed this our brother when he was present with you, and with what supports you aided him on his departure. But, since the works of those who do not recede from the good they have begun are acceptable to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we beg of you, greeting you with fatherly affection, to hold as peculiarly commended to you the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, bearers of these presents, whom we have sent to our aforesaid brother together with our most beloved sons, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Laurentius and the abbot Mellitus. And whatever kindness you before showed to him bestow ye on them also to the richer increase of your praise, to the end that, when through your provision they shall have accomplished without delay the journey they have begun, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> may be the recompenser of your good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and both your guardian in prosperity and your helper in adversity.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it has come to our ears that in your parts sacred orders are conferred with payment of money. And we are exceedingly distressed if the gifts of God are not attained by merit, but pounced upon by <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>. And, because this simoniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which was the first to arise in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was condemned by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, we beg of you for your own reward to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a synod to be assembled; to the end that, having been put down and eradicated by the definition of all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, it may in future find no power in your parts to endanger <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, nor be allowed henceforth to arise under any pretext whatever, that so our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> may exalt you against your adversaries in proportion as He sees that you have <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in fulfilling His commands, and as you take thought for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which had been in danger of perishing by the sword of this atrocity.</p>
