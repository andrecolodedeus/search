<h1>Book XI, Letter 62</h1>

<p> <em>To Brunichild, Queen of the Franks</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Brunichild, etc.</p>

<p>We render thanks to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who, among all the other gifts of His loving-kindness that He has bestowed upon your Excellency, has so filled you with a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> that whatever you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to pertain to the gain of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, whatever to the propagation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, you cease not to carry into effect with devout mind and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. As to the great favour and assistance wherewith your Excellence aided our most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Augustine on his progress to the nation of the Angli, fame had already not been silent; and afterwards certain <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, returning to us from him, gave us a particular account thereof.</p>

<p>And indeed, let others to whom your benefactions are less <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> wonder at these evidences of your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; for to us who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them by experience they are not a subject of wonder, but of rejoicing, because through what you bestow upon others you delight yourself. Now of what sort and how great are the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which our Redeemer has wrought in the conversion of the above-written nation is already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to your Excellency. On which account you ought to have great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, since the succours afforded by you claim to themselves the larger share herein, it having been through your aid, after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the word of preaching became widely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in those parts. For one who aids the good work of another makes it his own. But, that the fruit of your reward may be richer more and more, we beg of you kindly to afford the support of your patronage to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the bearers of these presents, whom we have sent with our most beloved sons, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Laurentius and the abbot Mellitus, to our aforesaid most reverend brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, because of his telling us that those who are with him are not sufficient; and to vouchsafe to stand by them in all things, to the end that, when by the good auspices of your Excellency they shall have had the better success, and shall have found no delays or difficulties in your parts, you may call down the mercy of our God towards you and your most sweet nephews in proportion as you have demeaned yourselves compassionately for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Him in causes of this kind.</p>
