<h1>Book XI, Letter 65</h1>

<p> <em>To Augustine, Bishop of the Angli</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Augustine, etc.</p>

<p>Though it is certain that for those who labour for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> ineffable rewards of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom are reserved, yet we must needs bestow honours upon them, that by reason of remuneration they may apply themselves the more manifoldly in devotion to spiritual work. And, since the new Church of the Angli has been brought to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> through the bountifulness of the same Lord and your labours, we grant to you the use of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> therein for the solemnization of mass only, so that you may ordain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in twelve several places, to be subject to your jurisdiction, with the view of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of London being always <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in future by his own synod, and receiving the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and Apostolical See which by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God I serve. Further, to the city of York we desire you to send a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whom you may judge fit to be ordained; so that, if this same city with the neighbouring places should receive the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he also may ordain twelve <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, so as to enjoy the dignity of a metropolitan: for to him also, if our life is continued, we propose, with the favour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to send a <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>; but yet we desire to subject him to the control of your Fraternity. But after your death let him be over the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom he shall have ordained, so as to be in no wise subject to the jurisdiction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of London. Further, between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of London and York in the future let there be this distinction of dignity, that he be accounted first who has been first ordained. But let them arrange by council in common, and with concordant action, whatever things may have to be done in <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; let them be of one mind in what is right, and accomplish what they are minded to do without disagreement with each other.</p>

<p>But let your Fraternity have subject to yourself under our God not only those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom you shall ordain, and those whom the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of York may ordain, but also all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Britain, to the end that they may learn the form of right belief and good living from the tongue and life of your Holiness, and, executing their office well in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and manners, may attain to heavenly kingdoms when it may please the Lord. God keep you safe, most reverend brother. Given on the tenth day of the Kalends of July, in the 19th year of the empire of our lord Mauricius Tiberius, the 18th year after the consulship of the same lord, Indiction 4.</p>
