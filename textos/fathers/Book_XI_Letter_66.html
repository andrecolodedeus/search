<h1>Book XI, Letter 66</h1>

<p> <em>To Edilbert, King of the Angli.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Edilbert, etc.</p>

<p>On this account <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> advances good men to the government of peoples, that through them He may bestow the gifts of His loving-kindness on all over whom they are preferred. This we have found to be the case in the nation of the Angli, which your Glory has been put over to the intent that through the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things granted to you, heavenly benefits might be conferred on the nation subject to you. And so, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> son, keep guard with anxious mind over the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which you have received from above. Make haste to extend the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among the peoples under your sway, redouble the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of your rectitude in their conversion, put down the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, overturn the edifices of their temples , build up the manners of your subjects in great purity of life by exhorting, by terrifying, by enticing, by correcting, by showing examples of well-doing; that so you may find Him your recompenser in heaven Whose name and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> you shall have spread abroad on earth. For He Himself will make the name of your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> even more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> to posterity, if you seek and maintain His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> among the nations. For so Constantine, the once most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor, recalling the Roman republic from perverse worshippings of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, subjected it with himself to our Almighty Lord God <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and turned himself with his subject peoples with all his heart to Him. Hence it came to pass that that man surpassed in praise the name of ancient princes, and excelled his predecessors as much in renown as in well-doing. And now, therefore, let your Glory make haste to infuse into the kings and peoples subject to you the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that you may both surpass the ancient kings of your race in renown and in deserts, and the more you shall have wiped away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others among your subjects, the more secure you may become with regard to your own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> before the terrible scrutiny of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, you have with you our most reverend brother, Augustine the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, learned in monastic rule, replete with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, endowed by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God with good works. Listen gladly to his admonitions, follow them devoutly, keep them studiously in remembrance: for, if you listen to him in what he speaks in behalf of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> will the sooner listen to him when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for you. For, if (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) you disregard his words, when will it be possible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> to hear him for you, whom you neglect to hear for God? With all your heart, therefore, bind ye yourselves in fervour of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to him, and aid his endeavours by the power which he gives you from above, that He Whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> you <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be received and kept in your kingdom may Himself make you partakers of His own Kingdom.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we would have your Glory <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, as we learn from the words of the Almighty Lord in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, the end of the present world is already close at hand, and the reign of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is coming, which can have no end. And, now that this end of the world is approaching, many things are at hand which previously have not been; to wit, changes of the air, terrors from heaven, and seasons contrary to the accustomed order of times, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, famine, pestilences, earthquakes in various places. Yet these things will not come in our days, but after our days they will all ensue. You therefore, if you observe any of these things occurring in your land, by no means let your mind be troubled, since these signs of the end of the world are sent beforehand for this purpose, that we should be solicitous about our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, suspectful of the hour of death, and in our good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> be found prepared for the coming Judge. These things, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> son, we have now briefly spoken of, that, when the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall have been extended in your kingdom, our speech to you may also extend itself to greater length, and that we may be pleased to speak so much the more fully as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> multiplies itself in our heart for the perfected conversion of your nation.</p>

<p>I have sent you some small presents, which to you will not be small, when received by you as of the benediction of the blessed Apostle Peter. And so may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> guard and perfect in you the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which He has begun, and extend your life here through courses of many years, and after a long life receive you in the congregation of the heavenly country. May heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> keep your Excellency safe, sir son (<em>domine fili</em>). Given this 10th day of the Kalends of July, the 19th year of the empire of our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord Mauricius Tiberius Augustus, the 18th year after the consulship of the same our lord, Indiction 4.</p>
