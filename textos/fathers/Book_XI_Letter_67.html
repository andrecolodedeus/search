<h1>Book XI, Letter 67</h1>

<p> <em>To Quiricus, Bishop, etc.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Quiricus, Bishop, and the other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in Hiberia .</p>

<p>Since to charity nothing is afar off, let those who are divided in place be joined by letter. The bearer of these presents, coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, asserted that he had received letters for us from your Fraternity, and had lost them, with other things also, in the city of Jerusalem. In them, as he says, you were desirous of enquiring with regard to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people who have been bewildered in the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, when they return to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is the mother of all the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, whether they should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, or joined to the bowels of the same mother Church by confession only of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>And indeed we have learned from the ancient institution of the Fathers that whosoever among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the Trinity, when they return to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, may be recalled to the bosom of mother Church either by unction of chrism, or by imposition of hands, or by profession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> only. Hence the West reconciles <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by imposition of hands, but the East by the unction of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> chrism. But <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> and others are received by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> confession only, because <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which they have received among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, then acquires in them the power of cleansing, when either the former receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by imposition of hands, or the latter are united to the bowels of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and universal Church by reason of their confession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, however, who are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the Trinity, such as the <em>Bonosiaci</em> and the <em>Cataphryg&aelig;</em>, because the former do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ the Lord, and the latter with a perverse understanding <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> a certain bad man, <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, to be the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, like whom are many others&mdash;these, when they come to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, because what they received while in their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, not being in the name of the Holy Trinity, was not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Nor can this be called an iteration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which, as has been said, had not been given in the name of the Trinity. But the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, since they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the Holy Trinity&mdash; though darkened by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in that, after the manner of Jewish unbelief, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not the Incarnation of the Only-begotten&mdash; when they come to the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are to be taught, by firm holding and profession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one and the same <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and man, our Lord God <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the same existing in Divinity before the ages, and the same made man in the end of the ages, because <em>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a> and dwelt among us</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a></span>.</p>

<p>But we say that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a> not by losing what He was, but by taking what He was not. For in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His Incarnation the Only-begotten of the Father increased what was ours, but diminished not what was His. Therefore the Word and the flesh is one Person, as He says Himself, <em>No man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> which is in heaven</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse14">John 3:14</a></span>. He Who is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in heaven was the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> who spoke on earth. Hence John says, <em>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has come, and has given us an understanding</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse20">1 John 5:20</a></span>. And as to what understanding He has given us, he straightway added, <em>That we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</em> Whom in this place does he mean as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God but the Father Almighty? But, as to what he conceives also of the Almighty Son, he added, And that we may be in his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Lo, he says that the Father is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son. And what he conceives this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son to be he shows more plainly; <em>This is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</em>. If, then, according to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> the Word were one and the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> were another, he who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man would not be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. But the Only-begotten Son, the Word before the Ages, was made man. He is, then, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Certainly, when the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin was about to conceive Him, and heard the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> speaking to her, she said, <em>Behold the hand-maid of the Lord; be it unto me according to your word</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse38">Luke 1:38</a></span>. And, when she had conceived Him, and went to <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a> her kinswoman, at once she heard, <em>Whence am I worthy that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</em> Lo, the same Virgin is called both the handmaid and the mother of the Lord. For she is the handmaid of the Lord, because the Word before the Ages, the Only-begotten, is equal to the Father; but the mother, because in her womb from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and of her flesh He was made man. Nor is she the handmaid of one and the mother of another, because, when the Only-begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, existing before the ages, of her womb was made man, by an inscrutable <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> she became both the handmaid of man by reason of the divinity and the mother of the Word by reason of the flesh. It was not that the flesh was first conceived in the womb of the Virgin, and the divinity afterwards came into the flesh; but that as soon as the Word came into the womb, immediately the Word, retaining the excellence of His own nature, was made flesh. And the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, through the womb of the Virgin, was born a perfect man, that is, in verity of flesh and of rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Whence also He is called Anointed above his fellows, as the Psalmist says, <em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed you with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above your fellows</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa044.htm#verse8">Psalm 44:8</a></span> . For He is anointed with oil, that is to say with the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But He was anointed above His fellows, because all we men first exist as sinners, and afterwards are sanctified through the unction of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But He Who, existing as God before the ages, was conceived as man through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the Virgin's womb at the end of the ages, was there anointed by the same Spirit, even where He was conceived. Nor was He first conceived and afterwards anointed; but to be conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of the flesh of the Virgin was itself to be anointed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, then, concerning His nativity let all who are brought back from the perverse <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> confess before the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> congregation of your Fraternity, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematising</a> the same <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> with all his followers, and all other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. The venerable synods also which the universal Church receives let them promise to receive and venerate; and let your Holiness without any hesitation receive them in your assembly, allowing them to retain their own orders, in order that, while you both carefully sift the secrets of their hearts, and teach them through <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the right things they ought to hold, and in gentleness make no difficulty or contradiction with them with respect to their own orders, you may snatch them from the mouth of the ancient foe; and that the retribution of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> may increase to you the more as you gather together many who may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with you in the Lord without end. Now may the Holy Trinity keep you in its protection while you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, and grant you in its <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> still more manifold gifts.</p>
