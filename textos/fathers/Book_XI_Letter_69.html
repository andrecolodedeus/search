<h1>Book XI, Letter 69</h1>

<p> <em>To Brunichild, Queen of the Franks.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Brunichild, etc.</p>

<p>Since it is written, <em>Righteousness exalts a nation; but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> makes peoples miserable</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse34">Proverbs 14:34</a></span>, a kingdom is then <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be stable when a fault that is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of is quickly amended. Now it has come to our ears by the report of many, what we cannot mention without exceeding affliction of heart, that certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in those parts live so immodestly and wickedly that it is a shame for us to hear of it and lamentable to tell it. Lest, then, now that the rumour of this iniquity has extended as far as here, the wrong doing of others should smite either our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or your kingdom with the dart of its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we ought to arise with ardour to avenge these things, lest the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of a few should be the perdition of many. For bad <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the ruin of a people. For who may offer himself as an intercessor for a people's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who ought to have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for it commits more grievous offenses? But, since those whose place it is to prosecute these things are stirred neither by care to enquire into them nor by <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to punish them, let letters from you be addressed to us, and let us send over, if you order it, a person with the assent of your authority, who together with other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> may search into these things thoroughly, and amend them according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For indeed what we speak of is not a thing to be winked at, since one who can amend a fault and neglects to do so without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> makes himself partaker in it. See therefore to your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, see to your grandsons, whom you wish to reign happily, see to the provinces; and, before our Creator stretches out His hand to smite, take most earnest thought for the correction of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, lest He afterwards smite by so much the more sharply as He now waits longer and more mercifully. Know moreover that you will offer a great <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of expiation to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if you cut off speedily from your territories the infection of so great a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>
