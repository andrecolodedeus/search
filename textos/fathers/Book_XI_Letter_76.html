<h1>Book XI, Letter 76</h1>

<p> <em>To Mellitus, Abbot.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Mellitus, Abbot in France .</p>

<p>Since the departure of our congregation, which is with you, we have been in a state of great suspense from having heard nothing of the success of your journey. But when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> shall have brought you to our most reverend brother the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Augustine, tell him that I have long been considering with myself about the case of the Angli; to wit, that the temples of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> in that nation should not be destroyed, but that the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> themselves that are in them should be. Let blessed water be prepared, and sprinkled in these temples, and altars constructed, and relics deposited, since, if these same temples are well built, it is needful that they should be transferred from the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to the service of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that, when the people themselves see that these temples are not destroyed, they may put away <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from their heart, and, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and adoring the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may have recourse with the more familiarity to the places they have been accustomed to. And, since they are wont to kill many oxen in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, they should have also some <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of this kind in a changed form, so that on the day of dedication, or on the anniversaries of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> whose relics are deposited there, they may make for themselves tents of the branches of trees around these temples that have been changed into churches, and celebrate the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> with religious feasts. Nor let them any longer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> animals to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but slay animals to the praise of God for their own eating, and return thanks to the Giver of all for their fullness, so that, while some joys are reserved to them outwardly, they may be able the more easily to incline their minds to inward joys. For it is undoubtedly impossible to cut away everything at once from hard hearts, since one who strives to ascend to the highest place must needs rise by steps or paces, and not by leaps. Thus to the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> the Lord did indeed make Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; but still He reserved to them in His own worship the use of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which they were accustomed to offer to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, enjoining them to immolate animals in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to Himself; to the end that, their hearts being changed, they should omit some things in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and retain others, so that, though the animals were the same as what they had been accustomed to offer, nevertheless, as they immolated them to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and not to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, they should be no longer the same <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. This then it is necessary for your Love to say to our aforesaid brother, that he, being now in that country, may consider well how he should arrange all things. God keep you safe, most beloved son. Given this 15th day of the Kalends of July, the 19th year of the empire of our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord Mauricius Tiberius Augustus, the 18th year after the consulship of the same our lord, Indiction 4.</p>
