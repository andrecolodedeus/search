<h1>Book XI, Letter 77</h1>

<p> <em>To Boniface, Guardian (Defensorem), in Corsica.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Boniface, etc.</p>

<p>Your experience is not free from blame, in that, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Aleria and Adjacium, cities of Corsica, to have been long without <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, you have delayed admonishing their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people to choose for themselves <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. But, since they ought to be no longer without rulers of their own, hasten, on receiving this authority, to exhort the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of these cities severally, that they disagree not among themselves, but that each city with one consent choose for itself a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. And, when they have made their decree, let such person as shall have been elected come to us. But, if they should be unwilling to come to an unanimous decision, being divided in their choice between two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, let both in like manner come to us, the decree having been made in the usual way, that, after enquiry made into their lives and characters, the one who may appear to be most fit may be ordained. Seeing, moreover, that many poor <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there are said to be oppressed and to suffer prejudice, let your Experience give heed to this, and not allow them to be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> aggrieved; but so endeavour yourself that neither they who take action be unreasonably hindered nor those against whom action is taken be in danger of sustaining damage <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it has reached our ears that some of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, you being on the spot, are held in custody by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. If this is so, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the blame will be imputed to you, since, if you were a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it would not have been the case. And accordingly you must needs pay attention in future so that you permit not the like to be done; but that, if any one should have a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of complaint against a clerk, he resort to his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. And, if perchance the latter should be suspected, a commissioner must be deputed by him&mdash; or, if this too should be objected to by the plaintiff, by your Experience,&mdash; who may compel the parties to choose arbitrators by mutual consent. And whatever may be decided by them, let it be in all ways so carried out, with due observance of law, by your own or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> care, that there may be no occasion for them to weary themselves with disputes.</p>
