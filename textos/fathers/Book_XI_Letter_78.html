<h1>Book XI, Letter 78</h1>

<p> <em>To Barbara and Antonina</em> .</p>

<p>Gregory to Barbara, etc.</p>

<p>On receiving your epistles, I was in all manner of ways delighted to hear of your well being, and I entreat <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that He would guard you by His protection from malignant spirits in thought, and from perverse men, and from all contrariety; and that He would, with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, settle you in unions worthy of you, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us all to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in your settlement . But do you, most sweet daughters, rest your hope on His help, and, being always under the shadow of His defence, both by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and by well doing, escape the plots of bad men. For, whatever <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> comforts or adversities there may be, there are none, unless either His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> protects or His displeasure troubles you. Rest therefore your hope on no one among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but bind your whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>. While we sleep, then, He will protect you, of whom it is written, <em>Behold he that keeps <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall neither slumber nor sleep</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa120.htm#verse4">Psalm 120:4</a></span> .</p>

<p>As to your saying that you are in haste to <a href="../cathen/15478a.htm">approach the threshold</a> of the blessed Peter, Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, I wish exceedingly, and wait with fervent desire, to see you in his church united to husbands well worthy of you; that so both you may obtain some little comfort from me, and I no little <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> from your presence. I have also commended your causes to your most reverend brother the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John , and to Romanus the guardian (<em>defensori</em>), that under God they may accomplish what they have begun.</p>

<p>Your present of two <em>racan&aelig;</em> , which you sent me word were your work, I accepted gladly. But yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the word you sent me. For you are seeking praise from the work of others, seeing that you have perhaps never yet put hand to spindle. Nor yet does this circumstance distress me, since I wish you to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the reading of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, that, so long as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> shall unite you to husbands, you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how you should live and how you should manage your houses.</p>
