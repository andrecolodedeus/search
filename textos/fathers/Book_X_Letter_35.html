<h1>Book X, Letter 35</h1>

<p> <em>To Eulogius, Patriarch of Alexandria.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Eulogius, etc.</p>

<p>In the past year I received the letters of your most sweet Holiness; but on account of the extreme severity of my sickness have been unable to reply to them until now. For lo, it is now almost full two years that I have been confined to my bed, afflicted with such pains of gout that I have hardly been able to rise on feast-days for as much as three hours space to solemnize mass. And I am soon compelled by severe pain to lie down, that I may be able to bear my torment with intervening groans. This pain of mine is sometimes moderate, and sometimes excessive: but neither so moderate as to depart, nor so excessive as to kill me. Hence it comes to pass that, being daily in death, I am daily debarred from death. Nor it is surprising that, grievous sinner as I am, I am long kept confined in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of such corruption. Whence I am compelled to exclaim, <em>Bring my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, that I may confess your name</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa141.htm#verse8">Psalm 141:8</a></span>. But, since I am not yet worthy to obtain this by my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, I beg that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of your Holiness may afford me the aid of its intercession, and deliver me from the weight of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and corruption into that liberty, which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well, of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Your to me most sweet and ever to be honoured Blessedness has informed me in your letter that our common son Anatolius, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the city of Constantinople, had written to you to say that certain <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from the parts about Jerusalem had come to me to make some enquiry concerning the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <em>Agnoit&aelig;</em> , and you say that he begged your Holiness to write to me to express your opinion with respect to this enquiry. But neither have <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> come to me from the parts about Jerusalem to make any enquiry, nor do I think that the said our common son can have told you in his letters what was not the case; but I suspect that the interpreter has mistaken the meaning of his letters. For the same <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, now more than two years ago, wrote to me that <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had come from the aforesaid parts to the city of Constantinople making such enquiries, and he desired to ask me what I thought. To him, long before I received your letters, I made the very same reply against that same <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> as I found afterwards in the epistle of your Holiness: and I returned great thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that concerning all questions the Fathers of the Romans and of the Greeks, whose followers we are, have spoken with one spirit. For in many parts I found this your epistle to be as though I had been reading the writings of the Latin Fathers against the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. And consider how much I must <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and praise the excellence of my most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother, in whose mouth I recognised the venerable Fathers, whom I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> so much. Praise therefore be to Him, to Him be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the highest, of whose gift the voice of Mark still cries aloud in the See of Peter ; from the effusion of whose spirit, when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> enters into the Holy of Holies for searching into <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, spiritual bells resound in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, as in the tabernacle, from the words of preaching. Right, then, and highly to be praised is your preaching. But we implore the Almighty Lord to keep you long even in this life, that from the organ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which you are, the voice of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may in this world sound more widely. And for me, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, intercede, that the way of this pilgrimage, which has become too rough for me, may with speed be finished, to the end that I, who cannot by my own merits, may by yours be able to attain to the promises of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> country, and to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with the citizens of heaven.</p>
