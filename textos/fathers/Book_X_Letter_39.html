<h1>Book X, Letter 39</h1>

<p> <em>To Eulogius, Patriarch of Alexandria.</em></p>

<p>Gregory to Eulogius, etc.</p>

<p> <em>As cold water to a thirsty <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> news from a far country</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro025.htm#verse25">Proverbs 25:25</a></span>. But what can be good news to me, so far as concerns the benefit of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, but to hear of the health and safety of your to me most sweet Holiness, who, from your perception of the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, both illuminate the same Church with the word of preaching, and mould it to a better way by the example of your manners? As often, too, as I recall in my heart your oneness of mind with me, and feel that I remain fixed in your heart, I give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that charity cannot be divided by distance of place. For, though in body we are far disjoined, yet in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> we are indivisible.</p>

<p>Our common son Anatolius the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>  has notified to me in his letters that in the royal city nothing <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> has at any time been disturbed from earthly causes. But I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he had before announced to me how your Blessedness had spoken in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to think that, where you chanced to be present, I do not consider that there was any want of me. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you, as a minister of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a follower of Peter, and a preacher of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Holy Church</a>, would speak what ought to have been heard through the mouth of a teacher from the Apostle Peter's See .</p>

<p>Moreover, before these days, when Abramius of Alexandria came to me, I had written in reply to your Holiness both what I thought of your writings which you issued against the Agnoite <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> , and why I had been so late in replying. But the said Abramius, compelled by difficulties of navigation, is reported to have delayed long in the city of Naples; and so I write again in the same sense in which I had formerly written, since in your teaching against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> that are called Agnoit&aelig; there was much for us to admire; but to displease us there was nothing. And in the same sense I had already written at length to our son Anatolius the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. Moreover, your doctrine so agreed in all respects with the Latin Fathers that I find, not to my surprise, that in diverse languages the Spirit has not been diverse.</p>

<p>For, as to what you have said about the fig-tree, Augustine speaks aptly in the same sense; for, when the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> subjoined, <em>For the time of figs was not yet</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar011.htm#verse13">Mark 11:13</a></span>, it is plainly shown that the figs which the Lord had sought were fruit in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, which had the leaves of the Law, but not the fruit of works. For the Creator of all things could not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the fig-tree had no fruit; which was a thing that all might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, since it was not the time of figs. But concerning what is written, <em>That the day and hour neither the Son nor the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a></em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse32">Mark 13:32</a></span>, your Holiness has quite rightly perceived that this is most certainly to be referred, not to the said Son with respect to His being the Head, but with respect to His body, which we are. With regard to which matter, the same blessed Augustine in many places adopts this sense (<em>Qu&aelig;st. lib.</em> lxxxiii. <em>q.</em> 60; <em>lib.</em> 1 <em>de Trinit.</em>, c. 12; <em>in psalm</em> vi., <em>init.; in ps.</em> xxxiv. <em>serm.</em> 2). He mentions also another thing that may be understood of the same Son, namely that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> sometimes speaks in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> manner, even as He says to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <em>Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you fear God</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse12">Genesis 22:12</a></span>. It was not that God then came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He was feared, but that He then made <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he feared God. For, as we speak of a glad day, not meaning that the day itself is glad, but that it makes us glad, so also the Almighty Son says that He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day which He causes not to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; not that He Himself does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, but that He does not allow it to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Whence also the Father alone is said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, because the Son Who is consubstantial with Him has His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of from His divine nature, whereby He is above the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Whence also it may be more nicely understood thus; that the Only-begotten, being incarnate and made for us a perfect man, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> indeed in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His humanity the day and hour of the judgment, but still it was not from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His humanity that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it. What then He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> in it He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not from it, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, made man, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the day and hour of the judgment through the power of His Deity: as also at the marriage, when the Virgin Mother said that wine was wanting, He replied, <em>Woman, what have I to do with you? Mine hour is not yet come</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse4">John 2:4</a></span>. For it was not that the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> was subject to the hour, having, among all things which He had created, made hours and times; but, because the Virgin Mother, when wine was wanting, wished a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> to be done by Him, it was at once answered her, <em>Woman, what have I to do with you?</em> As if to say plainly, That I can do a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> comes to me of my Father, not of my Mother. For He who of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His Father did <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> had it of His mother that He could die. Whence also, when He was on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, in dying He acknowledged His mother, whom He commended to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, saying, <em>Behold your mother</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse27">John 19:27</a></span>. He says, then, <em>Woman, what have I to do with you? Mine hour is not yet come.&mdash; </em>That is, <q>In the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, which I have not of your nature, I do not acknowledge you. When the hour of death shall come, I shall acknowledge you as my mother, since I have it of you that I can die.</q> And thus the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which He had not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of humanity whereby He was with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> a creature, this He denied that He had with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are creatures. The day, then, and the hour of the judgment He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but for this reason, that God is man. It is moreover a thing quite manifest, that whoso is not a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> cannot in any wise be an Agnoite. For with what meaning can one that confesses that the very Wisdom of God was incarnate say that there is anything that the Wisdom of God is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of? It is written, <em>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God. All things were made by him</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John 1:1</a></span>. If all things, then without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the day and hour of the judgment. Who then can be so senseless as to presume to say that the Word of the Father made what He is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of? It is written also, <em>Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the Father had given all things into his hands</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job022.htm#verse3">Job 22:3</a></span>. If all things, certainly both the day and the hour of the judgment. Who, then, is so foolish as to say that the Son received into His hands what He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not?</p>

<p>But, with respect to the passage in which He says to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> about Lazarus, <em>Where have laid him</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse34">John 11:34</a></span>, I felt exactly as you felt, that, if they say that the Lord did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> where Lazarus had been buried, and for that reason enquired, they will undoubtedly be compelled to acknowledge that the Lord did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what places <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> had hidden themselves after their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when He said in Paradise, <em>Adam, where are you</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse9">Genesis 3:9</a></span>? Or when He chides Cain saying, <em>Where is Abel your brother</em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse9">Genesis 4:9</a></span>? But, if He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, why did He immediately add, <em>Your brother's blood cries unto me from the ground?</em> However, on this passage Severianus Gabalensis speaks differently, saying that the Lord spoke thus to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as it were in the way of rebuke, in that He enquired where they had laid the dead Lazarus; as if with plain reference to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Eve He had said, I placed the man in Paradise, whom you have placed in the sepulchre.</p>

<p>But to these things our said common son Anatolius the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> has replied by putting another question:&mdash; What if it should be objected to me that, even as He who is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> vouchsafed to die that He might deliver us from death, and He who is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> before all time willed to become subject to time, so the Wisdom of God vouchsafed to take upon Himself our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that He might deliver us from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>? But I have not yet given him any reply to this, having been confined until now by grievous sickness. Now, however, through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> I have already begun to recover; and, if I should so recover as to be able to dictate, with the help of the Lord I will reply to him. To you it is not for me to say anything on this subject, lest I should seem to teach you what you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, seeing that even medicines lose their power of healing, if applied to sound and strong members.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we apprize you that in this place we suffer from serious difficulty for want of good interpreters. For there are none who can express the sense, while all ever try to translate the words exactly: and so they confuse the whole sense of what has been said. Whence it comes to pass that we are by no means able without severe labour to understand what has been translated.</p>

<p>I have received the blessing of <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Saint Mark the Evangelist</a> and of your Blessedness. And I have been desirous of sending you some timber; but the ship which came was too small to carry it. And yet even that which the Alexandrians saw when they came is of small size. For I had prepared some that is much larger for you, which has not yet been conveyed to the Roman city: for I waited for it to be conveyed when the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> ship should arrive; and it has remained in the place where it was felled.</p>

<p>May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> long guard your life for the edification of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Holy Church</a>, and inspire you to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> earnestly for me; that, being pressed down by my own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, I may be lifted up before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> by your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.</p>
