<h1>Canonical Epistle</h1>

<p><strong>With the Commentaries of Theodore Balsamon and John Zonaras. </strong></p>

<p> <em>The Canons of the Blessed Peter, Archbishop of Alexandria, as They are Given in His Sermon on Penitence.</em> </p>

<h2>Canon 1</h2>

<p>But since the fourth passover of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> has arrived, it is sufficient, in the case of those who have been apprehended and thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and who have sustained torments not to be borne,  and stripes intolerable, and many other dreadful afflictions, and afterwards have been betrayed by the frailty of the flesh, even though they were not at the first received On account of their grievous fall that followed yet because they contended sorely and resisted long; for they did not come to this of their own will, but were betrayed by the frailty of the flesh for they show in their bodies the marks of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>,  and some are now, for the third year, bewailing their fault: it is sufficient, I say, that from the time of their submissive approach, other forty days should be enjoined upon them, to keep them in remembrance of these things; those forty days during which, though <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> had fasted, He was yet, after He had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, tempted of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And when they shall have, during these days, exercised themselves much, and constantly fasted, then let them watch in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, meditating upon what was spoken by the Lord to him who tempted Him to fall down and worship him: <q>Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062219"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;4:10</a></span> </p>

<p>Balsamon. The present canons treat of those who have in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and are doing penance. And the first canon ordains, that upon those who after many torments have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to the gods, not being able by reason of frailty to persevere, and who have passed three years in penitence, other forty days should be enjoined, and that then they should be admitted into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Observe these present canons which lay down various and useful rules in favour of those who have denied their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and seek for repentance, and concerning those who have of their own accord sought <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and have lapsed, and then have again confessed the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and other things of the like nature. Consult also, for you will profitably do so, many canons of the Council of Ancyra.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. Amongst those who in these turbulent times denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Peter makes a distinction, and says, that upon those who had been brought before the tyrant, and thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and who had endured very grievous torments, and intolerable scourgings, and such as could be cured by no care or medicine (for <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;<!--k29--'&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> signifies medical care, and <span class="greek">&#x03B1;<!--k29--'&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> is the same as immedicabile), and other dreadful afflictions, and afterwards yielding, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to the gods, being betrayed as it were by the weakness of the flesh, which could not hold out under the pain unto the end, that for them the time past should suffice for punishment; since, indeed, says he, the fourth passover has now past since they made this very grievous fall. And although perhaps at first, when they approached in penitence, they, were not received, yet because they did not of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> proceed to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the gods, and resisted long, and hear about with them the marks of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that is to say, the scars of the wounds which, in behalf of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they have endured, and the third year has now elapsed since they first bewailed their fall, he decrees that, as an additional punishment, other forty days from the time that they came asking to be admitted to communion should be enjoined on them in the place of any further severity; during which they should exercise a still greater degree of penance, and should fast more earnestly, that is, with more attentive care, keeping guard over themselves, being watchful in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, meditating upon, that is, turning over perpetually in their minds, and saying in words, the text quoted by the Lord against the tempter, <q>Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.</q></p>

<h2>Canon 2</h2>

<p>But in the case of those who, after that they were thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and in the dungeon, as in a place besieged, endured afflictions and nauseous odours, bill afterwards, without the conflict of torments, were led captive, being broken in spirit by poverty of strength, and a certain blindness of the understanding, a year in addition to the foregoing time will suffice; for they gave themselves up to be afflicted for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even though in their dungeon they enjoyed much consolation from their brethren; which, indeed, they shall return many fold, desiring to be set free from that most bitter captivity of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, especially remembering Him who said: <q>The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to the poor; He has sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised; to preach the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of recompense unto our God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062220"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;61:1-2</a>; <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;4:18-19</a></span> </p>

<p>Balsamon. This canon enacts that those who have only been <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> entreated in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and who without torment have lapsed, should be punished after the three years with an additional year. For though they obtained consolation, certain of the faithful ministering to them the necessaries of life, yet they ought to obtain pardon, as being those who have suffered severely for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. In the second order, he places those who have only been thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> entreated in the dungeon, and yet, though harassed by no torments, have offended; upon whom, besides the time past, the three years, namely, of which we have spoken, he proposes to inflict the penalty of an additional year, since they also, says he, have for Christ's name endured hardness, even though it may be that they obtained some consolation from the brethren while in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. For it is probable that the faithful, who were not in custody, ministered to those in bonds the necessaries of life, and brought to them some alleviation of their lot. Which things, indeed, they shall return many fold; for those consolations which they enjoyed in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> they shall vex themselves with penance, and afflict themselves in diverse ways, if they wish to be set free from the captivity of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, having become his captives and slaves by their denial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He subjoins the word of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, taken from Isaiah, which he says that they ought to keep in remembrance.</p>

<h2>Canon 3</h2>

<p>But as for those who have suffered none of these things, and have shown no fruit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>., but of their own accord have gone over to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, being betrayed by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and cowardice, and now come to repentance, it is necessary and convenient to propose the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the unfruitful fig-tree, as the Lord says: <q>A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbers it the ground? And he answering, said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it. And if it bear fruit, well; and if not, then alter mat you shall cut it down.</q> Keeping this before their eyes, and showing forth fruit worthy of repentance, after so long an interval of time, they will be profiled.</p>

<p>Balsamon. Those who from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> only and timidity deserted the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and then had an eye towards repentance, the canon punishes with three years' exclusion, according to the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the fig-tree in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. For the Lord said, Three years I come to it seeking fruit, and find none; but the vine-dresser replies, Lord, let it alone this year also.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. But those, he says, who having suffered no hardness, have deserted from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> only and timidity, in that they of their own accord have approached to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; and then looked towards repentance, their case the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the fig-tree in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> will exactly suit. Let them keep this before their eyes, and show forth for an equal period labours worthy of penitence, and they shall be profited; that is, after the fourth year. For the Lord said, Three years I come to it seeking fruit, and find none; and the vine-dresser answered, Lord, let it alone this year also.</p>

<h2>Canon 4</h2>

<p>To those who are altogether reprobate, and unrepentant, who possess the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian's</a> unchanging skin, <span class="stiki" id="note062221"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse23">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:23</a></span> and the leopard's spots, it shall be said, as it was spoken to another fig-tree, <q>Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever; and it presently withered away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062222"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;21:19</a></span> For in them is fulfilled what was spoken by the Preacher: <q>That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062223"><a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse15">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;1:15</a></span> For unless that which is crooked shall first he made straight, it is impossible for it to be adorned; and unless that which is wanting shall first be made up, it cannot be numbered. Hence also, in the end, will happen unto them what is spoken by Esaias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>They shall look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062224"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse24">Isaiah 66:24</a></span> Since as by the same also has been predicted, <q>But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. There is no peace, says my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062225"><a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse20">Isaiah 57:20-21</a></span></p>

<p>Balsamon. What has been previously said of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, has been said of the repentant. But against those who are unrepentant, he brings forward the cursing of another fig-tree, to which the Lord said, because of its unprofitableness, <q>No fruit grow on you hence-forward for ever.</q></p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. What has been previously said of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, has been said of the repentant. Against those whom, from desperation or depraved opinion, are impenitent, and carry about with them perpetually the inherent and indelible blackness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as of an <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian's</a> skin, or the leopard's spots, he brings forward the cursing of another fig-tree. To which the Lord said for its barrenness, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever. And he says that in them must be fulfilled that word of the Preacher: <q>That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</q> Then having explained these things, he subjoins the words of Isaiah.</p>

<h2>Canon 5</h2>

<p>But upon those who have used dissimulation like David, who reigned himself to be mad  to avoid death, being not mad in reality; and those who have not nakedly written down their denial of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but being in much tribulation, as boys endowed with sagacity and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> among foolish children, have mocked the snares of their enemies, either passing by the altars, or giving a writing, or sending <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> to do <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> instead of themselves, even though some of them who have confessed have, as I have heard, pardoned individuals of them, since with the greatest caution they have avoided to touch the fire with their own hands, and to offer <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to the impure <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; yet inasmuch as they escaped the notice of their persecutors by doing this, let a penalty of six months' penance be imposed upon them. For thus will they be the rather profited, meditating upon the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> words, and saying, <q>Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called the Messenger of My mighty counsel.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062227"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah 9:6</a></span> Who, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, when another infant in the sixth month <span class="stiki" id="note062228"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse76">Luke 1:76-77</a></span> of his conception had preached before His coming repentance for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, was himself also conceived to preach repentance. Moreover, we hear both also preaching, in the first place, not only repentance, but the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, which, as we have learned, is within us;<span class="stiki" id="note062229"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse21">Luke 17:21</a></span> for the word which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is near us, in our mouth, and in our heart; which they, being put in remembrance of, will learn to confess with their mouths that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ; believing in their heart that God has raised him from the dead, and being as those who hear, that <q>with the heart man <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062230"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse8">Romans 10:8-10</a></span></p>

<p>Balsamon. But if any have pretended to approach the altars, or to write their denial of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have not done this nakedly and openly, but by reigned arts have illuded those who offered them <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, as David did, who, when he was flying from Saul, and was among strangers, feigned himself to be mad, and thus escaped death. So they mocked the snares of their enemies, as children endowed with wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> mock foolish children; for they deceived the impious <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, in that they seemed to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, although they did not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, or perhaps they suborned <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and infidels to take their place, and by these means they thought that they offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; for them, he says, a period of six months will suffice for penance. For although they did not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, yet because they promised to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, or sent others to do so in their place, they are thought to stand in need of repentance, even though some of those who have given their testimony for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> have pardoned individuals of them. He compares them to children, as not having manfully withstood the idolaters, but to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> children, because by artifice they avoided doing <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. But if any have pretended to approach the altars, or to write their denial of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but have not nakedly written down their abnegation, that is, not manifestly, not openly; but by a sort of trick have cheated those who offered them <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>; as David, who while lie was flying from Saul, and bad come among strange people, reigned himself to be mad, and in this way avoided death. They mocked indeed, he children, endowed with wisdom and sagacity, and those says, the insidious devices of their enemies; as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> who skilfully take counsel, deceive foolish children. Now be compares those to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> children by whom the impious <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> were deceived, and those who though they did not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, yet seemed to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> indeed, as having thus far avoided <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a>; but children, in that they did not show forth a mature and manly spirit, and did not nobly resist the worshippers of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, but covenanted to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, even though they suborned some in their places, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, forsooth, and infidels, and when these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, they were considered to have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>. For men of this sort, he says, a period of six months will suffice for penance. For although they did not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, yet because they covenanted to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, or suborned others to do so, and thus themselves appeared to have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, they were judged to stand in need of repentance; even though some confessors might have pardoned individuals of them; for some of those who witnessed to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and suffered for it, pardoned those who by an artifice, as has been said, escaped offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and admitted them to communion with the faithful, because they studiously avoided offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. And on account of the fixing of this term of six months, he calls to remembrance the annunciation made by Gabriel, in the sixth month of the conception of the Forerunner, in which the Lord was conceived. Then he subjoins the words of the apostle.</p>

<h2>Canon 6</h2>

<p>In the case of those who have sent <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> slaves to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for them, the slaves indeed as being in their master's hands, and in a manner themselves also in the custody of their masters, and being threatened by them, and from their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> having come to this pass and having lapsed, shall during the year show forth the works of penitence, learning for the future, as the slaves of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Christ and to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him, listening to this especially, that <q>whatsoever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062231"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse8">Ephesians 6:8</a></span></p>

<p>Balsamon. The slaves who under the commands and threatenings of their masters offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, this father punishes with a year's exclusion; yet he pardons them as having acted under the orders of a master, and does not inflict a heavy punishment upon them. But yet since they are much more the servants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even as they ought to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him more, he imposes on them a moderate punishment; for, as says the great <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>whatsoever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</q></p>

<h2>Canon 8</h2>

<p>But to those who have been delivered up, and have fallen, who also of their own accord have approached the contest, confessing themselves to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and have been tormented and thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, it is right with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and exultation of heart to add strength, and to communicate to them in all things, both in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and in partaking of the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and in hortatory discourse; in order that contending the more constantly, they may be counted worthy of <q>the prize of their high calling.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062235"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse14">Philippians 3:14</a></span> For <q>seven times,</q> he says, <q>a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man falls, and rises up again,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062236"><a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse16">Proverbs 24:16</a></span> which, indeed, if all that have lapsed had done, they would have shown forth a most perfect penitence, and one which penetrates the whole heart.</p>

<p>Balsamon. Some had had information laid against them before the tyrant, and had been delivered up, or themselves had of their own accord given themselves up, and then being overcome by their torments, had failed in their testimony. Afterwards repenting, and acknowledging what was right and good, they confessed themselves to he <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, so that they were cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and afflicted with torments. These this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man thinks it right to receive with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of heart, and to confirm in the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to communicate with, both in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and in partaking of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and to exhort with cheering words, that they may be more constant in the contest, and counted worthy of the heavenly kingdom. And that it might not be thought that they ought not to be received, because they hart lapsed, he brings forward the testimony of Scripture to the effect that <q>seven times,</q> that is, often, <q>the just man falls, and rises up again.</q> And, says he, if all who have failed in their confession had done this, namely, taken up their struggle again, and before the tyrant confessed themselves to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, they would have shown forth a most perfect penitence. The subject, therefore, comprehended in this canon differs from that contained in the first canon, for there indeed those who by reason of their torment had lapsed, were not converted so as to confess the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> before the tyrants; but here those who by reason of their torment have lapsed, with a worthy penitence, confess the Lord before the tyrants, wherefore they are reckoned not to have fallen.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. But, says he, if any have had information laid against them before the tyrants, and have been delivered up, or have of themselves given themselves up, and being overcome by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of their torments have failed in their testimony, not being able to endure the distresses and afflictions with which in the dungeon they were afflicted; and afterwards taking up the contest anew, have confessed themselves to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, so that they have been again cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and afflicted with torments: such men this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> judges it reasonable that they should be joyfully received; and that they should be strengthened, that is, have strength, spirit, and confidence added to them, in order that they may confess the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that they should be communicared with in all things, both in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and in partaking of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and that they should be exhorted with loving words, to rouse themselves to give testimony to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that they may be more constant in the contest, and counted worthy of the heavenly kingdom. And that it might not he thought by any that they ought not to be received from the fact that they had lapsed, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, he brings forth this testimony from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>: <q>Seven times,</q> that is, often, <q>the just man falls, and rises up again.</q> And, says be, if all who have failed in their confession had done this, that is, after their fall, taken up the contest afresh, and confessed themselves to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> before the tyrants, they would have given <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a most perfect repentance.</p>

<p>Balsamon. Those who have but just arisen from sleep, and especially if they were weighed down with a heavy and profound sleep, have no constant reason, but one perturbed and unsteady. To such as these this blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> likens those who, not in due order, but rashly and inconsiderately, thrust themselves upon the contest, which is as it were in travail, and delayed and protracted, inasmuch as it has not vet burst forth openly, but meditates and delays, hesitating in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to bring forth the combatants, who bring <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> upon themselves, or draw it towards them. Now these especially are, for the rest of the faithful, kindling the coals of the sinners, that is to say, the punishment of the tyrants. But although he reprehends those who act so, yet he enjoins the faithful nevertheless to communicate with them, because on account of Christ they have undergone the contest, even though they have ignored His teaching, for He teaches them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that they may not be tempted; and He did not deliver up Himself, but was delivered up; and we are not to go over to the tormentors, that we may not be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of bringing upon them the guilt of many murders, as those do who incite them to inflict punishment upon the godly. The canon brings forward different examples from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. Those who have recently arisen from sleep, especially if they were oppressed with a heavy sleep, have no steady reason, but one inconstant and perturbed. To men of this sort this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> likens those who rush upon the contest, that is, those who, not in due course, but rashly and inconsiderately, intrude themselves upon it. It is, as it were, in travail, and delayed and protracted, inasmuch as it has not yet burst forth openly, but meditates and delays, and hesitates to bring forth the combatants, who bring <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> upon themselves, that is, draw it towards themselves, or rather, for the rest of the faithful, kindle the coals of the sinners, the torments, namely, which are by the tyrants inflicted. But although he finds fault with those who act in this way, he nevertheless decrees that the faithful must communicate with them, because in the name of Christ they come forward to this, trusting, that is, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or in His name demanding this trial for themselves, even though, perhaps, they are not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> His precepts; for He taught them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that they might not be tempted; and they are ignoring the fact too that the Lord retired from those who were laying snares for Him, and was wont sometimes to walk not openly; neither did He give up Himself to His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, but was given up by others; and He commanded His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, when their enemies <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> them, to fly from city to city, and not of their own accord to give themselves up to the tormentors, lest they should be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of bringing the guilt of much blood upon their heads, irritating them as it were to inflict punishment upon godly men. And he brings forward the example of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, of Stephen, of James, and the chiefs of the order, Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 10</h2>

<p>Whence it is not right either that those of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who have deserted of their own accord, and have lapsed, and taken up the contest afresh, should remain any longer in their sacred office, inasmuch as they have left destitute the flock of the Lord, and brought blame upon themselves, which thing did not one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For when the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had undergone many <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, and had shown forth the prizes of many contests, though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was far better to <q>depart, and to be with Christ,</q> yet he brings this forward, and says, <q>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062249"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians 1:23-24</a></span> For considering not his own advantage but the advantage of many, that they might be saved, he judged it more necessary than his own rest to remain with the brethren, and to have a care for them; who also would have him that teaches to be <q>in doctrine</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062250"><a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse7">Titus 2:7</a></span> an example to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Whence it follows that those who, contending in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, have fallen from their ministry, and have again taken up the struggle, are plainly wanting in perception. For how else is it that they seek for that which they have left, when in this present time they can be useful to the brethren? For as long as they remained firm and stable, of that which they had done contrary to reason, of this indulgence was accorded them. But when they lapsed, as having carried themselves with ostentation,  and brought reproach upon themselves, they can no longer discharge their sacred ministry; and, therefore, let them the rather take heed to pass their life in humility, ceasing from vainglory. For communion is sufficient for them, which is granted them with diligence and care for two causes; both that they should not seem to be afflicted with sorrow, and hence by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> seize on their departure from this world; and also lest any of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> should have a pretext for being remiss by occasion of the punishment. And these indeed will reap more shame and ignominy than all others, even as he who laid the foundation and was not able to finish it; for <q>all that pass by,</q> He says, will begin to mock him, saying, <q>This man laid the foundation, and was not able to finish it.</q></p>

<p>Balsamon. The father having spoken of those who of their own accord went over to the contest of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, now also speaks of those of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who are in such a case, and he says, that if any <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> has of his own accord sought the contest, and then, not being able to bear the tortures, has fallen, but returning to himself, has recanted his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and before the tyrants confessed himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, such a one shall no longer discharge his sacred ministry, because he has deserted the Lord's flock, and because, having of his own accord sought the contest, through not being able to endure the torment, he has brought reproach upon himself. For to neglect the teaching of the people, and to prefer their own advantage, this did not the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For the mighty <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, after that he had endured many torments, though he perceived that it was far better to leave this life, yet chose rather to live and to be tormented for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and instruction of the people. They are therefore altogether devoid of perception who seek the sacred ministry from which they have fallen of their own accord. For how is it that they seek for that which they have left, when they are able in this season of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, that is, to be useful to their brethren? If indeed they had not fallen, of that which they had done contrary to reason, their spontaneous flight for instance, or their slackness in teaching and confirming the brethren, of these things indulgence would be extended to them. But if from their own arrogance and conceit they have lapsed&mdash;for of such a nature is it rashly to venture to expose themselves to torture, and not to be able to endure it, and thus a triumph has been gained over them&mdash;they cannot any longer execute their sacred office. Wherefore let them the rather take heed that they perfect their confession by humility, ceasing from the vainglory of seeking for the sacred ministry; for communion with the faithful is sufficient for them, which is granted for two reasons, with diligent caution, and just judgment. For if we say that we will not hold them to be communicants, we shall both afflict them with grief, giving our sentence as it were that they should depart this life with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>; and we shall <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> others also, who may have lapsed, and wish to return to what is right, to be negligent and remiss in this respect, having as a pretext, that they will not be admitted to communicate with the faithful, even though after their fall they should confess the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who, if they are not converted, will undergo more shame and ignominy than others, even as he who laid the foundation, and did not finish the building. For such a one do those resemble, who, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake indeed, have offered themselves to be tormented, and having laid as it were a good foundation, have not been able to perfect that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by reason of their fall. Observe, then, that not even confession for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake restores him who has once lapsed and thus become an alien from his clerical office.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. The father having spoken of those who have of their own accord exposed themselves to the contest of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, now begins to discourse about those of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who have done the same thing; and says that if any <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> has of his own accord given himself up, and then, not being able to endure the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the torment, has fallen, and again recollecting himself has roused himself afresh to the contest, and has confessed himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> before the tyrants, a man of this sort is not any longer to be admitted to the sacred ministry. And the reason of this he subjoins; because he has forsaken the Lord's flock, and because having of his own accord offered himself to the enemy, and not having with constancy endured his torments, he has brought reproach upon himself. But that they should despise the instruction of the people, and prefer their own advantage, this did not the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For the mighty <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, though he had endured many torments, and felt that it was better for him to leave this life, preferred to live and to be tormented for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and instruction of the people. Wherefore he demonstrates those to be altogether devoid of perception who ask for the sacred ministry from which they have voluntarily fallen. For how is it, says he, that they ask for that which they have left, when in a season of this sort, of raging <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> forsooth, they can be of great assistance to the brethren? As long as they were free from the charge of having lapsed, they would have obtained pardon for their action that was rashly undertaken, that, namely, of voluntarily offering themselves to the adversary, or their negligence in instructing the brethren. But since they have fallen, inasmuch as they have acted ostentatiously, they are not to be permitted any longer to discharge their sacred functions. If, says he, that they had not fallen they would have obtained pardon for their action which was devoid of reason; calling that action devoid of reason, not only because they gave themselves up to the enemy, but rather because they deserted the Lord's flock, and did not remain to guard it, and to confirm the brethren who were harassed in this time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. But if they have fallen, from the fact that they have carried themselves vauntingly, and he here calls <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and arrogance <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;<!--k29--'&#x03B1;</span>, because it is from arrogance that they have put confidence in themselves, and have put an end to the contest, and have brought reproach upon themselves; that is, by reason of their fall, they have contracted a blemish and stain, it is not lawful for them any longer to be occupied in the sacred ministry. Wherefore let them study, says he, to perfect their confession by humility, ceasing forsooth from all vainglory. For in that they seek to be enrolled in the sacred ministry, this proceeds from ambition and self-seeking. For communion is sufficient for them, that the faithful should communicate with them, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with them, and that they should participate in the sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. And this should be granted with diligent caution and care, both lest they should seem to be afflicted with grief, seizing on a dissolution of this life, lest, that is, as he says, being overcome with grief, they should depart and get free from the body, that is, go out from it, from the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the torment and afflictions which they undergo in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; and that none should have the pretext of their punishment for carrying themselves dissolutely and cowardly in the contest of confession, and thus fall away. Who will the rather be put to shame, according to the saying in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>Who could not finish after that he had laid the foundation.</q> </p>

<p>Moreover, let those apply their minds to what is in this place brought forward by this great father and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, who say that it is lawful for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to give up their Sees, and to retain the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. For if to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who voluntarily offered themselves to the contest of confession, and who, when tormented, failed in constancy and yielded, and afterwards returned to the contest, if to them indulgence is scarcely granted, because they deferred to execute their ministerial duties; nor, in the opinion of this divine father, is any thing else objected to them but that they deserted the brethren, when in adverse and turbulent times they might have been useful in confirming them in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that after that they had been counted worthy to bear testimony to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and carried about in their flesh shall that chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and the marks of Christ; how pastor, who ought to lay down his life for the sheep, when he has deserted the flock that was committed unto him, and repudiated its care and administration, and as far as in him lies given it over to the wolf, be thought worthy to retain the dignity of the sacred ministry, and not rather be judged worthy of the severest punish-meats for deserting the people entrusted to his care? Nay, but he will demand a reward for this thing, or rather he will himself supply it to himself: refusing that which brings labour to them, namely, the office of teaching and of correcting <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>; but embracing that which gains for them <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, making it their own, keeping hold of it with their teeth as it were, and not letting it go in the least. For if in the case of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> it be called an action contrary to reason to desert the people, and to go away from them to the contest in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; how much more contrary to reason shall it be judged for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to desert his people, not in order that he may contend in a contest, but that he may deliver himself up to ease and indolence, and lay aside and escape entirely from his cares for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>? The sixteenth canon also of the Seventh Oecumenical Council  gravely accuses those of folly who decree that the dignity of the sacred ministry can be retained by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who has repudiated his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>. For if according to the sentence of the aforesaid canon, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who has been absent from his See more than six months, unless some one of the causes there enumerated shall have intervened, has both fallen from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> and the highest dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and is deprived of both; how shall he who has repudiated the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, and refuses any longer to feed the flock entrusted to him, and despises the care of it through his desire of an easy life, be held to be of the number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>? For if he who has committed the lesser fault, of leaving for more than six months the people placed under him destitute of the care and administration of a pastor, incurs the privation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> and of his sacred dignity; he who offends in a way greater and much more grievous, namely, in deserting altogether the multitude which the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has committed to him to be cared for and guarded, shall deservedly be punished with greater severity, and will pay the heavier penalty of losing, as far as he is concerned, the flock of which he was appointed shepherd by the great and chief Shepherd and High Priest. But those who decree the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to him as a reward and <em>honorarium</em> for declining his office, in my opinion make both themselves and him obnoxious to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 11</h2>

<p>For those who first, when the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> grew warm, leaped forth, standing around the judgment-seat, and beholding the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who were hastening to the <q>prize of their high calling,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062254"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse14">Philippians 3:14</a></span> then, fired with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, gave themselves up to this, using much boldness, and especially when they saw those who were drawn aside and lapsed, on their account they were roused mightily within, and, as it were by some inward voice, impelled to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> down and subdue the adversary who was exulting; for this they earnestly contended, that he might not seem <q>to be wise in his own conceit,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062255"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse16">Romans 12:16</a></span> on account of those things in which by reason of his subtlety they appeared to be inferior to him, even though it escaped his observation that he was overcome by those who with constancy endured the torments of the lash and scourge, and the sharp edge of the sword, the burning in the fire, and the immersion in the water. To those also who entreat that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be made either in behalf of those who have been punished by imprisonment, and have been delivered up by hunger and thirst, or for those who out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> have by the judges been tortured with whippings and scourgings, and afterwards have been overcome by the infirmity of the flesh, it is right to give our consent. For to sympathize with the sorrow and affliction of those who sorrow and mourn for those who in the contest have been overcome by the great strength of the evil-contriving <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, whether it be for <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or brethren, or children, hurts no one. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that on account of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of others some have obtained the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both in the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and in the health of their bodies, and in the resurrection of the dead. Therefore, being mindful of the many labours and distresses which for the name of Christ they have sustained, since they have themselves also repented, and have bewailed that which was done by them through their being betrayed by the languor and mortification of the body; and since, besides this, they testify that in their life they have as it were been aliens from their city, let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> together with them and entreat for their reconciliation, together with other things that are befitting, through Hint who is <q>our Advocate with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and makes propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <q>And if any man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> says he, <q>we have an Advocate with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the righteous: and He is the propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062256"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse1">1 John 2:1</a></span></p>

<p>Balsamon. The saint having said before that those who of their own accord entered upon the contest and lapsed, and did not repent nor recant their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, would be covered with more shame, as being like men who did not go on with the building beyond the foundation, that is, did not perfect that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, now brings forward a confirmation of this and other matters, saying, Those who taking their stand in the fervour and vehemence of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, seeing the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and with what divine <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> they contended to receive the celestial crown, gave themselves up to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> with much boldness, and especially when they saw some drawn aside, that is, led astray and deluded by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and lapsing or denying godliness; wherefore being inwardly inflamed, and with hearts enkindled, as hearing that they by this means should <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> down and subdue the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> adversary the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, were eager to undergo <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> lest the the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> should boast and seem <q>to be wise in his own conceit,</q> as having by his subtlety and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> overcome those who of their own accord sought <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>: even though it escaped him that he was rather overcome by those combatants who bravely withstood the torments. Therefore to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for those who are enduring punishment, and afflicted by it is right to assent or to concur in this, which is also decreed; and it can by no means be hurtful to sympathize in their sorrow and affliction with the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> or other <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> in behalf of those who have given their testimony and undergone <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, but have lapsed by the arts and snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many have obtained the goodness and compassion of God by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of others. Therefore we will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them that remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be granted them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and with the others who have lapsed, and have afterwards recanted their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and confessed godliness, we will communicate, being mindful of those contests which before their fall they sustained for God's sake, and also of their subsequent worthy repentance, and that they testify that on account of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> they have been as it were aliens from their city; and we will not only communicate with them, but <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> also for their reconciliation, together with other things that are convenient, either with the good works which ought to be done by them&mdash; <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, for instance, almsgiving, and penance; by which things He who is our Advocate makes the Father propitious towards us. Then he makes use of a passage of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, and this is taken from the first catholic epistle of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> apostle and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. The meaning of the present canon is as follows:&mdash; Those, he says, who set in the fervour of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, that is, in its greatest height and most vehement heat, beheld the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and how eagerly they hastened to receive the celestial crown, fired with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> emulation, gave themselves up to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, leaping as it were into the contest with much boldness, in imitation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who suffered, and offered themselves readily for the confirming of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by their testimony; and on that account especially, because they behold many who were drawn aside, that is, led astray, denying their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Whereupon they being inflamed, that is, tired in heart, endeavoured to subdue the adversary that was hostile to them, that he might not, as a victor, exult over the godly. Although it escaped him that he was rather conquered by them, many even unto death showing forth constancy for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. They hastened, therefore, says he, to do this, but overcome by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of their torments, by reason of the infirmity of the flesh, being some of them <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> entreated in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and others punished by decree of the judges, and not being able to endure their punishment. It is meet, therefore, to sympathize with those who mourn for their sakes. Now they mourn, says he, some the lapse of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, others of brethren, and others of children. To mourn, therefore, with those who bewail the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, hurts no one; neither to join in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and grief with those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for themselves, together with other things that are reasonable, namely, that they who have lapsed may show forth other things that are consistent with penitence; such as are <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and tears and other humiliations, and observe the punishment inflicted on them, and, if their means allow, bestow money upon the poor; by which means He who is the Advocate in our behalf will render the Father propitious to us. Then he brings forward a passage from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, which is taken from the first epistle of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> apostle and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John.</p>

<h2>Canon 12</h2>

<p>Against those who have given money that they might be entirely undisturbed by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,  an accusation cannot be brought.

For after that they had been very burdensome to them for his name, and had troubled the people and the rulers of the city, <q>having taken security,</q> he says, <q>of Jason, and of the others, they let them go. And the brethren immediately sent away <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Silas by night unto Berea.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062261"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse9">Acts 17:9-10</a></span></p>

<p>Balsamon. After that the saint had finished his discourse concerning those who of their own accord had offered themselves to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, he said that those were not to be reprehended who by a sum of money paid down freed themselves from the affliction of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. For they preferred to make a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of their money rather than of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Then he confirms this, and brings forward different Scripture examples from the Acts of the Apostles concerning the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and others.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. But those, he says, are not to be reprehended who have paid money down, and thus escaped, and maintained their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, nor for this thing may any one bring an accusation against them. For they have preferred to lose their money rather than their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and have shown that they wish to serve God and not <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>; that is, riches. And he brings forward the words of Scripture, and the example, as in the Acts of the Apostles, of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and others. Now, when it is said that they have been undisturbed by all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? It is to be so taken, either that they have been left undisturbed, so far as the denial of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is concerned, which overcomes all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,  or he means  the afflictions of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>.</p>

<p>Hence neither is it lawful to accuse those who have left all, and have retired for the safety of their life, as if Others had been held back by them.

<p>Balsamon. But if any, says he, have left their good and gone away, lest they should be detailed and brought into peril, as being those perhaps who might not be able to persist in their confession to the end, on account of the cruelty of their tormentors, they shall not be found fault with, even though others have been detained on their account. And he brings forward as all instance on this score Gaius and Aristarchus, who were detained instead of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; the soldiers who kept Peter; the infants who were massacred by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> on account of Christ; and Zacharias, the father of the revered and blessed forerunner.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. But if any, says he, have left their possessions, and have gone away, lest being detained they should be endangered, and because, perhaps, they would not be able to persist in their confession unto the cud on account of the cruelty of the tormentors, they are not to be accused, even if others are detailed and published on their account. And, again, he brings forward an example from the Acts of the Apostles, saying that at Ephesus also Gaius and Aristarchus were apprehended in the stead of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was not blamed for this; nor was Peter, when he was brought forth out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and escaped the danger, and the soldiers who guarded him were on his account punished. Then he cites another example from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, namely, the infants who were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>; on account of which, says he, our Lord was not blamed. And when <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a> had taken to flight with John, and had preserved him, his father Zacharias was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, the child being demanded of him; nor was this imputed as a crime to John.</p>

<h2>Canon 14</h2>

<p>But if any have endured much <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and the strong pressure of necessity, receiving into their mouths iron and chains, and for their good affection towards the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> have bravely borne the burning of their hands that against their will had been put to the profane <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, as from their <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> the thrice-blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> have written to me respecting those in Libya, and others their fellow-ministers; such, on the testimony of the rest of their brethren, can be placed in the ministry among the confessors, as those who have been mortified by many torments, and were no longer able either to speak, or to give utterance, or to move, so as to resist those who vainly offered them <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. For they did not assent to their impiety; as I have again heard from their fellow-ministers, they will be reckoned among the confessors, as also he who has after the example of Timothy ordered his life, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> him who says, <q>Follow after righteousness, godliness, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, lay hold on <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, whereunto you are also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062273"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse11">1 Timothy 6:11-12</a></span></p>

<p>Balsamon. Those who by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the tyrant seemed to eat meat that had been offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, or to drink wine from the Greek libations&mdash;for it happened sometimes that they were thrown upon the ground, and hooks or pieces of iron put into their mouths to keep them open, and then the tyrants poured wine down their throats, or threw into them pieces of meat; or putting hot coals into their hands, together with <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, they compelled them to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>&mdash;if they were clergymen, the canon decrees that they should each in his own degree be ranked among the confessors; but if <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. that they should be reckoned as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, because they did not these things of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, nor did they at all assent to the action. As also among the confessors are to be reckoned those who from the extremity of the tortures lost their strength of body, and were not able to resist those who poured into their mouths the wine of the libations. And next in order he speaks of those who give the testimony of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and enumerates them among the confessors.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. Those who chastised the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, after many torments, in the case of some violently poured into their mouths the wine of the libations, or even crammed into their mouths some of the meat that had been offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and putting <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> into their hands, they dragged them to the altars, and then violently seizing on their hands, they either sprinkled the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> upon the altar or placed hot coals together with the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> into their hands, that, not being able to bear the pain of the burning, they might drop the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> together with the coals upon the altar; for they were constrained by them. Men of this sort, he affirms, can remain enrolled in the sacred ministry, or rather be placed in the rank of confessors. For they did not by their own choice either taste the libations, or place the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> upon the altar, but being compelled by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, their reason not consenting to the action; as also those who from the extremity of the suffering lost their bodily vigour, so as neither to be able to speak or move, nor to resist those who were violently pouring into their months the wine of libations, these also are to be placed among the cofessors. And next in order he discourses of those who give the testimony of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and places them also in the number of confessors.</p>

<h2>Canon 15</h2>

<p>No one shall find fault with us for observing the fourth day of the week, and the preparation,  on which it is reasonably enjoined us to fast according to the tradition.  On the fourth day, indeed, because on it the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> took counsel for the betrayal of the Lord; and on the sixth, because on it He himself suffered for us. But the Lord's day we celebrate as a day of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, because on it He rose again, on which day we have received it for a custom not even to bow the knee.</p>

<p>Balsamon. Conformably to the sixty-fourth Apostolical canon, which decrees that we are not to fast on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, with one exception, the great <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>; and to the sixty-ninth canon, which severely punishes those who do not fast in the Holy Lent, and on every fourth day of the week and day of preparation. Thus also does the present canon decree.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a></span>. Always, says he, are the fourth and sixth days of every week to be kept as <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>; nor will any one find fault with us for <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> on them; and the reasons he subjoins. But on the Lord's day we ought not to fast, for it is a day of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for the resurrection of the Lord, and on it, says he, we have received that we ought not even to bow the knee. This word, therefore, is to be carefully observed, we have received, and <q>it is enjoined upon us according to the tradition.</q> For from hence it is evident that long-established custom was taken for law. Moreover, the great Basil annexes also the causes for which it was forbidden to bend the knee on the Lord's day, and from the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> to Pentecost. Read also the sixty-sixth and sixty-ninth Apostolical canons.  </p>
