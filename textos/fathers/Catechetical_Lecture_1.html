<h1>Catechetical Lecture 1</h1>

<p><strong>To those who are to be Enlightened, delivered extempore at Jerusalem, as an Introductory Lecture to those who had come forward for Baptism :</strong></p>

<p>With a reading from <a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse16">Isaiah</a></p>

<p> <em>Wash you, make you clean; put away your iniquities from your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, from before my eyes</em>, and the rest <span class="stiki" id="note310459"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse16">Isaiah&nbsp;1:16</a></span> .</p>

<p>1. Disciples of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and partakers of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as yet by calling only, but ere long by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> also, <em>make you a new heart and a new spirit</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310460"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse31">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:31</a></span>, that there may be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> among the inhabitants of heaven: for <em>if over one sinner that <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a> there is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a></em>, according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <span class="stiki" id="note310461"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;15:7</a></span>, how much more shall the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of so many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> move the inhabitants of heaven to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. As you have entered upon a good and most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> path, run with reverence the race of godliness. For the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is present here most ready to redeem you, saying, <em>Come unto Me all that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310462"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;11:28</a></span> You that are clothed with the rough garment  of your offenses, who are <em>holden with the cords of your own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em>, hear the voice of the Prophet saying, <em>Wash you, make you clean, put away your iniquities from before My eyes</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310464"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse16">Isaiah&nbsp;1:16</a></span>: that the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of Angels may chant over you, <em>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are covered</em>.  You who have just lighted the torches of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> , guard them carefully in your hands unquenched; that He, who erewhile on this all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Golgotha opened Paradise to the robber on account of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, may grant to you to sing the bridal song.</p>

<p>2. If any here is a slave of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, let him promptly prepare himself through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for the new birth into freedom and adoption; and having put off the miserable bondage of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and taken on him the most blessed bondage of the Lord, so may he be counted worthy to inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. <em>Put off</em>, by confession , <em>the old man, which waxes corrupt after the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of deceit</em>, that you may <em>put on the new man, which is renewed according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him that created him</em>.  Get you <em>the earnest of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note310469"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse22">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:22</a></span> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that you may be able to be received <em>into the everlasting habitations</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310470"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;16:9</a></span> Come for the mystical Seal, that you may be easily recognised by the Master; be numbered among the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and spiritual flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to be set apart on His right hand, and inherit the life prepared for you. For they to whom the rough garment  of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> still clings are found on the left hand, because they came not to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which is given through Christ at the new birth of Baptism: new birth I mean not of bodies, but the spiritual new birth of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For our bodies are begotten by <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who are seen, but our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are begotten anew through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: <em>for the Spirit blows where it lists</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310472"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;3:8</a></span>: and then, if you be found worthy, you may hear, <em>Well done, good and faithful servant</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310473"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;25:21</a></span>, when you are found to have no defilement of hypocrisy in your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</p>

<p>3. For if any of those who are present should think to tempt God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he deceives himself, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not its power. Keep your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> free from hypocrisy, O man, because of Him <em>who searches hearts and reins</em>.  For as those who are going to make a levy for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> examine the ages and the bodies  of those who are taking service, so also the Lord in enlisting <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> examines their purpose: and if any has a secret hypocrisy, He rejects the man as unfit for His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> service; but if He finds one worthy, to him He readily gives His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. He gives not <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things to the dogs <span class="stiki" id="note310475"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span>; but where He discerns the good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, there He gives the Seal of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that wondrous Seal, which devils tremble at, and Angels recognise; that the one may be driven to flight, and the others may watch around it as kindred to themselves. Those therefore who receive this spiritual and saving Seal, have need also of the disposition akin to it. For as a writing-reed or a dart has need of one to use it, so <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> also has need of believing minds.</p>

<p>4. You are receiving not a perishable but a spiritual shield. Henceforth you are planted in the invisible  Paradise. Thou   receive a new name, which you had not before. Heretofore you were a Catechumen, but now you will be called a Believer. You are transplanted henceforth among the spiritual  olive-trees, being grafted from the wild into the good olive-tree <span class="stiki" id="note310478"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;11:24</a></span>, from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> into righteousness, from pollutions into purity. You are made partaker of the Holy Vine.  Well then, if you abide in the Vine, you grow as a fruitful branch; but if you abide not, you will be consumed by the fire. Let us therefore bear fruit worthily. God forbid that in us should be done what befell that barren fig-tree <span class="stiki" id="note310480"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;21:19</a></span>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> come not even now and curse us for our barrenness. But may all be able to use that other saying, <em>But I am like a fruitful olive-tree in the house of God: I have trusted in the mercy of God for ever</em> &mdash;an olive-tree not to be perceived by sense, but by the mind , and full of light. As then it is His part to plant and to water , so it is yours to bear fruit: it is God's to grant <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but yours to receive and guard it. Despise not the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> because it is freely given, but receive and treasure it devoutly.</p>

<p>5. The present is the season of confession: confess what you have done in word or in deed, by night or by day; <em>confess in an acceptable time, and in the day of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note310484"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:2</a></span> receive the heavenly treasure. Devote your time to the Exorcisms: be assiduous at the Catechisings, and remember the things that shall be spoken, for they are spoken not for your ears only, but that by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> you may seal them up in the memory. Blot out from your mind all earthly  care: for you are running for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. You are utterly forsaking the things of the world: little are the things which you are forsaking, great what the Lord is giving. Forsake things present, and put your trust in things to come. Have you run so many circles of the years busied in vain about the world, and have you not forty days to be free (for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> ), for your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> sake? <em>Be still</em> , <em>and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am God</em>, says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>. Excuse yourself from talking many idle words: neither backbite, nor lend a willing ear to backbiters; but rather be prompt to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Show in <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> exercise that your heart is nerved.  Cleanse your vessel, that you may receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> more abundantly. For though remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is given equally to all, the communion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is bestowed in proportion to each man's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. If you have laboured little, you receive little; but if you have wrought much, the reward is great. You are running for yourself, see to your own interest.</p>

<p>6. If you have anything against any man, forgive it: you come here to receive forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and thou also must forgive him that has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against you. Else with what face will you say to the Lord, Forgive me my many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if you have not yourself forgiven your fellow-servant even his little <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Attend diligently the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> assemblies ; not only now when diligent attendance is required of you by the Clergy, but also after you have received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For if, before you have received it, the practice is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is it not also good after the bestowal? If before thou be grafted in, it is a safe course to be watered and tended, is it not far better after the planting? Wrestle for your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, especially in such days as these. Nourish your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with sacred readings; for the Lord has prepared for you a spiritual table; therefore say thou also after the Psalmist, <em>The Lord is my shepherd, and I shall lack nothing: in a place of grass, there has He made me rest; He has fed me beside the waters of comfort, He has converted my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em> :&mdash; that Angels also may share your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and Christ Himself the great High Priest, having accepted your resolve, may present you all to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, saying, <em>Behold, I and the children whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given Me</em>.  May He keep you all well-pleasing in His sight! To whom be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the power unto the endless ages of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
