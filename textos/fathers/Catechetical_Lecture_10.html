<h1>Catechetical Lecture 10</h1>

<p><strong>On the Clause, and in One Lord Jesus Christ, with a Reading from the First Epistle to the Corinthians</strong></p>

<p> <em>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth</em>  <em>; yet to us there is One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, through whom are all things, and we through Him.</em></p>

<p>1. They who have been taught to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <q>In One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty,</q> ought also to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His Only-begotten Son. For <em>he that denies the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the same has not the Father</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311115"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:23</a></span> <em>I am the Door</em> , says Jesus; <em>no one comes unto the Father but through Me</em>.  For if you deny the Door, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> concerning the Father is shut off from you. <em>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the father, save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whomsoever the Son shall reveal Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311118"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> For if you deny Him who reveals, you remain in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. There is a sentence in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, saying, <em>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not on the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, shall not see life; but the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God abides on him.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311119"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;3:36</a></span> For the Father has indignation when the Only-begotten Son is set at nought. For it is grievous to a king that merely his soldier should be dishonoured; and when one of his nobler officers or friends is dishonoured, then his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is greatly increased: but if any should do despite to the king's only-begotten son himself, who shall appease the father's indignation on behalf of his only-begotten son?</p>

<p>2. If, therefore, any one wishes to show <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let him worship the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since otherwise the Father accepts not his service. The Father spoke with a loud voice from heaven, saying, <em>This is My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311120"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;3:17</a></span> The Father was well pleased; unless thou also be well pleased in Him, you have not life. Be not thou carried away with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> when they craftily say, There is one God alone; but with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that God is One, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is also an Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. I am not the first to say this, but the Psalmist in the person of the Son says, <em>The Lord said unto Me, You are My Son</em>.  Heed not therefore what the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say, but what the Prophets say. Do you wonder that they who <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> and slew the Prophets, set at nought the Prophet.' words?</p>

<p>3. Believe thou In One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Only-Begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For we say <q>One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,</q> that His Sonship may be <q>Only-begotten:</q> we say <q>One,</q> that you may not suppose another: we say <q>One,</q> that you may not profanely diffuse the many names  of His action among many sons. For He is called a Door ; but take not the name literally for a thing of wood, but a spiritual, a living Door, discriminating those who enter in. He is called a Way <span class="stiki" id="note311124"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span>, not one trodden by feet, but leading to the Father in heaven; He is called a Sheep , not an irrational one, but the one which through its precious blood cleanses the world from its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is led before the shearers, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> when to be silent. This Sheep again is called a Shepherd, who says, <em>I am the Good Shepherd</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311126"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;10:11</a></span>: a Sheep because of His manhood, a Shepherd because of the loving-kindness of His Godhead. And would you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there are rational sheep? The Saviour says to the Apostles, <em>Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves</em>.  Again, He is called a Lion , not as a devourer of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but indicating as it were by the title His kingly, and steadfast, and confident nature: a Lion He is also called in opposition to the lion our adversary,  who roars and devours those who have been deceived. <span class="stiki" id="note311129"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span> For the Saviour came, not as having changed the gentleness of His own nature, but as the strong <em>Lion of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a></em> , saving them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but treading down the adversary. He is called a Stone, not a lifeless stone, cut out by men's hands, but a <em>chief corner-stone</em> , on whom <em>whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> shall not be put to shame</em>.</p>

<p>4. He is called Christ, not as having been anointed by men's hands, but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> anointed by the Father to His High-Priesthood on behalf of men.  He is called Dead, not as having abode among the dead, as all in Hades, but as being alone <em>free among the dead</em>.  He is called <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, not as having had His generation from earth, as each of us, but as coming upon the clouds To Judge Both Quick and Dead.  He is called Lord, not improperly as those who are so called among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but as having a natural and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Lordship.  He is called Jesus by a fitting name, as having the appellation from His salutary healing. He is called Son, not as advanced by adoption, but as naturally begotten. And many are the titles of our Saviour; lest, therefore, His manifold appellations should make you think of many sons, and because of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is one, and Jesus another, and the Door another, and so on , the Faith secures you beforehand, saying well, In One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>: for though the titles are many, yet their subject is one.</p>

<p>5. But the Saviour comes in various forms to each man for his profit.  For to those who have need of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> He becomes a Vine; and to those who want to enter in He stands as a Door; and to those who need to offer up their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> He stands a mediating High Priest. Again, to those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> He becomes a Sheep, that He may be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for them. <em>He is made all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note311138"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:22</a></span>, remaining in His own nature what He is. For so remaining, and holding the dignity of His Sonship in reality unchangeable, He adapts Himself to our infirmities, just as some excellent physician or compassionate teacher; though He is Very Lord, and received not the Lordship by advancement , but has the dignity of His Lordship from nature, and is not called Lord improperly , as we are, but is so in verity, since by the Father's bidding  He is Lord of His own works. For our lordship is over men of equal rights and like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, nay often over our elders, and often a young master rules over aged servants. But in the case of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> the Lordship is not so: but He is first Maker, then Lord : first He made all things by the Father's will, then, He is Lord of the things which were made by Him.</p>

<p>6. <em>Christ the Lord</em> is He who was <em>born in the city of David</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311143"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;2:11</a></span> And would you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is Lord with the Father even before His Incarnation , that you may not only accept the statement by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but may also receive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>? Go to the first book, Genesis: God says, <em>Let us make man</em>, not 'in My image,' but, <em>in Our image</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311145"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> And after <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was made, the sacred writer says, <em>And God created man; in the image of God created He him</em>.  For he did not limit the dignity of the Godhead to the Father alone, but included the Son also: that it might be shown that man is not only the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who is Himself also Very God. This Lord, who works together with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, wrought with Him also in the case of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>: <em>And the Lord rained upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven</em>.  This Lord is He who afterwards was seen of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as much as he was able to see. For the Lord is loving unto man, ever condescending to our infirmities.</p>

<p>7. Moreover, that you may be sure that this is He who was seen of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> testimony, when he says, <em>For they all drank of a spiritual rock that followed them; and the rock was Christ</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311148"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4</a></span> And again: <em>By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> forsook <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note311149"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse27">Hebrews&nbsp;11:27</a></span>, and shortly after he says, <em>accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a></em>.  This <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says to Him, <em>Show me Yourself</em>. You see that the Prophets also in those times saw the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, as far as each was able. <em> Show me Yourself, that I may see You with understanding</em>.  But He says, <em>There shall no man see My face, and live</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311152"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;33:20</a></span> For this reason then, because no man could see the face of the Godhead and live, He took on Him the face of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that we might see this and live. And yet when He wished to show even that with a little majesty, when <em>His face did shine as the sun</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311153"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;17:2</a></span>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> fell down affrighted. If then His bodily countenance, shining not in the full power of Him that wrought, but according to the capacity of the Disciples, affrighted them, so that even thus they could not bear it, how could any man gaze upon the majesty of the Godhead? 'A great thing,' says the Lord, you desire, O <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: and I approve your insatiable desire, <em>and I will do this thing</em>  for you, but according as you are able. <em>Behold, I will put you in the cleft of the rock</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311155"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse22">Exodus&nbsp;33:22</a></span>: for as being little, you shall lodge in a little space.'</p>

<p>8. Now here I wish you to make safe what I am going to say, because of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For our object is to prove that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> was with the Father. The Lord then says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <em>I will pass by before you with My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and will proclaim the name of the Lord before you</em>.  Being Himself the Lord, what Lord does He proclaim? You see how He was covertly teaching the godly doctrine of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. And again, in what follows it is written word for word: <em>And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord. And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, both keeping righteousness and showing mercy unto thousands, taking away iniquities, and transgressions, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em>.  Then in what follows, <em><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> bowed his head and worshipped</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311158"><a href="../bible/exo034.htm#verse8">Exodus&nbsp;34:8</a></span> before the Lord who proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and said: Go then, O Lord, in the midst of us. </p>

<p>9. This is the first <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>: receive now a second plain one. <em>The Lord said unto my Lord, sit Thou on My right hand</em>.  The Lord says this to the Lord, not to a servant, but to the Lord of all, and His own Son, to whom He put all things in subjection. <em>But when He says that all things are put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted, which did put all things under Him</em>, and what follows; <em>that God may be all in all</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311161"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:27-28</a></span> The Only-begotten Son is Lord of all, but the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for He grasped not the Lordship , but received it by nature of the Father's own will. For neither did the Son grasp it, nor the Father grudge to impart it. He it is who says, <em>All things are delivered unto Me of My Father</em> ; <q>delivered unto Me, not as though I had them not before; and I keep them well, not robbing Him who has given them.</q></p>

<p>10. The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> then is Lord: He is Lord, who was born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of Jud&aelig;a, according to the Angel who said to the shepherds, <em>I bring you good tidings of great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that unto you is born this day in the city of David Christ the Lord</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311164"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;2:10-11</a></span>: of whom an Apostle says elsewhere, <em>The word which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent unto the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, preaching the gospel of peace by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>: He is Lord of all</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311165"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse36">Acts&nbsp;10:36</a></span> But when he says, <em>of all</em>, do thou except nothing from His Lordship: for whether Angels, or Archangels, or principalities, or powers, or any created thing named by the Apostles, all are under the Lordship of the Son. Of Angels He is Lord, as you have it in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, <em>Then the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> departed from Him, and the Angels came and ministered unto Him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311166"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;4:11</a></span>; for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says not, they succoured Him, but they <em>ministered unto Him</em>, that is, like servants. When He was about to be born of a Virgin, Gabriel was then His servant, having received His service as a peculiar dignity. When He was about to go into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that He might overthrow the gods of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> made with hands , again <em>an Angel appears to Joseph in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311168"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;2:13</a></span> After He had been crucified, and had risen again, an Angel brought the good tidings, and as a trustworthy servant said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <em>Go, tell His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that He is risen, and goes before you into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>; lo, I have told you</em> : almost as if he had said, <q>I have not neglected my command, I protest that I have told you; that if you disregard it, the blame may not be on me, but on those who disregard it.</q> This then is the One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, of whom the lesson just now read speaks: <em>For though there be many that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth</em>, and so on, <em>yet to us there is One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and One Lord, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, through whom are all things, and we through Him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311170"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:5-6</a></span> .</p>

<p>11. And He is called by two names, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; Jesus, because He saves,&mdash; Christ, because He is a Priest.  And <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this the inspired Prophet <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> conferred these two titles on two men distinguished above all : his own successor in the government, Auses , he renamed Jesus; and his own brother <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> he surnamed Christ , that by two well-approved men he might represent at once both the High Priesthood, and the Kingship of the One <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> who was to come. For Christ is a High Priest like <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>; since He <em><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> not Himself to be made a High Priest, but He that spoke unto Him, You are a Priest for ever after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a></em>.  And Jesus the son of Nave was in many things a type of Him. For when he began to rule over the people, he began from Jordan <span class="stiki" id="note311176"><a href="../bible/jos003.htm#verse1">Joshua&nbsp;3:1</a></span>, whence Christ also, after He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, began to preach the gospel. And the son of Nave appoints twelve to divide the inheritance ; and twelve Apostles Jesus sends forth, as heralds of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, into all the world. The typical Jesus saved Rahab the harlot when she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Jesus says, <em>Behold, the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and the harlots go before you into the kingdom of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311178"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;21:31</a></span> With only a shout the walls of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> fell down in the time of the type: and because Jesus said, <em>There shall not be left here one stone upon another</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311179"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;24:2</a></span>, the Temple of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> opposite to us is fallen, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its fall not being the denunciation but the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the transgressors.</p>

<p>12. There is One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, a wondrous name, indirectly announced beforehand by the Prophets. For Esaias the Prophet says, <em>Behold, your Saviour comes, having His own reward</em>.  Now Jesus in Hebrew is by interpretation <em>Saviour</em>. For the Prophetic gift, foreseeing the murderous spirit of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> against their Lord , veiled His name, lest from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it plainly beforehand they might plot against Him readily. But He was openly called Jesus not by men, but by an Angel, who came not by his own authority, but was sent by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said to Joseph, <em>Fear not to take unto you Mary your wife; for that which is con</em> <em>ceivedin her is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And she shall bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311182"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;1:20</a></span> And immediately he renders the reason of this name, saying, <em>for He shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em>. Consider how He who was not yet born could have a <em>people</em>, unless He was in being before He was born.  This also the Prophet says in His person, <em>From the bowels of my mother has He made mention of My name</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311184"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;49:1</a></span>; because the Angel foretold that He should be called Jesus. And again concerning <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> plot again he says, <em>And under the shadow of His hand has He hid Me</em>. </p>

<p>13. Jesus then means according to the Hebrew <q>Saviour,</q> but in the Greek tongue <q>The Healer;</q> since He is physician of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and bodies, curer of spirits, curing the blind in body , and leading minds into light, healing the visibly lame, and guiding sinners' steps to repentance, saying to the palsied, <em>Sin no more</em>, and, <em>Take up your bed and walk</em>.  For since the body was palsied for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, He ministered first to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that He might extend the healing to the body. If, therefore, any one is suffering in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, there is the Physician for him: and if any one here is of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, let him say to Him, <em>Help my unbelief</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311188"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse24">Mark&nbsp;9:24</a></span> If any is encompassed also with bodily ailments, let him not be faithless, but let him draw near; for to such diseases also Jesus ministers , and let him learn that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ.</p>

<p>14. For that He is Jesus the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> allow, but not further that He is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore says the Apostle, <em>Who is the liar, but he that denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311190"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:22</a></span>? But Christ is a High Priest, <em>whose <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> passes not to another</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311191"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse24">Hebrews&nbsp;7:24</a></span>, neither having begun His Priesthood in time , nor having any successor in His High-Priesthood: as you heard on the Lord's day, when we were discoursing in the congregation  on the phrase, <em>After the Order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a></em>. He received not the High-Priesthood from bodily succession, nor was He anointed with oil prepared by man , but before all ages by the Father; and He so far excels the others as <em>with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a></em> He is made Priest: <em>For they are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> without an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, but He with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by Him that said, The Lord swore, and will not repent</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311195"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse21">Hebrews&nbsp;7:21</a></span> The mere purpose of the Father was sufficient for surety: but the mode of assurance is twofold, namely that with the purpose there follows the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> also, <em>that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to lie, we might have strong encouragement</em>  for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who receive Christ Jesus as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>15. This Christ, when He had come, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> denied, but the devils confessed. But His forefather David was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Him, when he said, <em>I have ordained a lamp for mine Anointed</em> : which lamp some have interpreted to be the brightness of Prophecy , others the flesh which He took upon Him from the Virgin, according to the Apostle's word, <em>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels</em>.  The Prophet was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Him, when He said, <em>and announces unto men His Christ</em>.  <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him, Isaiah <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him, and Jeremiah; not one of the Prophets was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Him. Even devils recognised Him, for He rebuked them, and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <em>because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He was Christ</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311201"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;4:41</a></span> The Chief-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not, and the devils confessed Him: the Chief Priests <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not, and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> proclaimed Him, saying, <em>Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did. Is not this the Christ</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311202"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;4:29</a></span>?</p>

<p>16. This is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> who came <em>a High-Priest of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311203"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse11">Hebrews&nbsp;9:11</a></span>; who for the bountifulness of His Godhead imparted His own title to us all. For kings among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have their royal style which others may not share: but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> being the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> gave us the dignity of being called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. But some one will say, The name of <q><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a></q> is new, and was not in use aforetime : and new-fashioned phrases are often objected to on the score of strangeness.  The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> made this point safe beforehand, saying, <em>But upon My servants shall a new name be called, which shall be blessed upon the earth</em>.  Let us question the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: Are you servants of the Lord, or not? Show then your new name. For you were called <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and after the return from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and up to the present time: where then is your new name? But we, since we are servants of the Lord, have that new name: <em>new</em> indeed, but the <em>new name, which shall be blessed upon the earth</em>. This name caught the world in its grasp: for <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are only in a certain region, but <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> reach to the ends of the world: for it is the name of the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> that is proclaimed.</p>

<p>17. But would you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Apostles <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and preached the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or rather had Christ Himself within them? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says to his hearers, <em>Or seek a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of Christ that speaks in me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311207"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span>? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> proclaims Christ, saying, <em>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake</em>.  Who then is this? The former persecutor. O mighty wonder! The former persecutor himself preaches Christ. But wherefore? Was he <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribed</a>? Nay there was none to use this mode of persuasion. But was it that he saw Him present on earth, and was abashed? He had already been taken up into heaven. He went forth to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a>, and after three days the persecutor is a preacher in Damascus. By what power? Others call friends as witnesses for friends but I have presented to you as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the former enemy: and do you still <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>? The testimony of Peter and John, though weighty, was yet of a kind open to suspicion: for they were His friends. But of one who was formerly his enemy, and afterwards dies for His sake, who can any longer <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</p>

<p>18. At this point of my discourse I am <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> filled with wonder at the wise dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; how He confined the Epistles of the rest to a small number, but to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the former persecutor gave the privilege of writing fourteen. For it was not because Peter or John was less that He restrained the gift; God forbid! But in order that the doctrine might be beyond question, He granted to the former enemy and persecutor the privilege of writing more, in order that we all might thus be made <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. For <em>all were amazed</em> at <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and said, <em>Is not this he that</em> was formerly a persecutor <span class="stiki" id="note311209"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse21">Acts&nbsp;9:21</a></span>? Did he not come hither, that he might lead us away bound to Jerusalem? Be not amazed, said <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <em>it is hard for me to kick against the pricks:</em> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <em>I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note311210"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:9</a></span>; but I did it <em>in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note311211"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:13</a></span>: for I thought that the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was destruction of the Law, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that He came Himself to fulfil the Law and not to destroy it. <span class="stiki" id="note311212"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span> <em>But the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God was exceeding abundant in me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311213"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:14</a></span> .</p>

<p>19. Many, my beloved, are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> testimonies concerning Christ. The Father bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> from heaven of His Son: the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, descending bodily in likeness of a dove: the Archangel Gabriel bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, bringing good tidings to Mary: the Virgin <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>  bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>: the blessed place of the manger bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, which received the Lord while yet young in the body : Symeon bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, who received Him in his arms, and said, <em>Now, Lord, let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word; for my eyes have seen Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which You have prepared before the face of all people</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311216"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;2:29-30</a></span> Anna also, the prophetess, a most devout <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, of austere life, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Him. John the Baptist bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, the greatest among the Prophets, and leader of the New Covenant, who in a manner united both Covenants in Himself, the Old and the New. Jordan is His <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> among rivers; the sea of Tiberias among seas: blind and lame bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and dead men raised to life, and devils saying, <em>What have we to do with You, Jesus? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, who You are, the Holy One of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311217"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse24">Mark&nbsp;1:24</a></span> Winds bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, silenced at His bidding: five loaves multiplied into five thousand bear Him <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> wood of the Cross bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, seen among us to this day, and from this place now almost filling the whole world, by means of those who in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> take portions from it.  The palm-tree  on the ravine bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, having supplied the palm-branches to the children who then hailed Him. Gethsemane  bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, still to the thoughtful almost showing Judas. Golgotha , the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hill standing above us here, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to our sight: the Holy Sepulchre bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and the stone which lies there  to this day. The sun now shining is His <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, which then at the time of His saving Passion was eclipsed : the darkness is His <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, which was then from the sixth hour to the ninth: the light bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, which shone forth from the ninth hour until evening. The <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mount from which He ascended to the Father: the rain-bearing clouds are His witnesses, having received their Lord: yea, and the gates of heaven bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> [having received their Lord ], concerning which the Psalmist said, <em>Lift up your doors, O you Princes, and be lifted up you everlasting doors; and the King of Glory shall come in</em>.  His former enemies bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, of whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> is one, having been a little while His enemy, but for a long time His servant: the Twelve Apostles are His witnesses, having preached the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> not only in words, but also by their own torments and deaths: <em>the shadow of Peter</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311226"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;5:15</a></span> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, having healed the sick in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The handkerchiefs and aprons bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, as in like manner by Christ's power they wrought cures of old through <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.  Persians  and Goths , and all the Gentile converts bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, by dying for His sake, whom they never saw with eyes of flesh: the devils, who to this day  are driven out by the faithful, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Him.</p>

<p>20. So many and diverse, yea and more than these, are His witnesses: is then the Christ thus witnessed any longer disbelieved? Nay rather if there is any one who formerly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, let him now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: and if any was before a believer, let him receive a greater increase of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by believing in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and let him understand whose name he bears. You are called a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>: be tender of the name; let not <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> through you: but rather <em>let your good works shine before men</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311231"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;5:16</a></span> that they who see them may in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a> glorify the Father which is in heaven: To whom be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, both now and for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
