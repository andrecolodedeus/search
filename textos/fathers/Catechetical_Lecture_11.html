<h1>Catechetical Lecture 11</h1>

<p><strong>On the Words, the Only-Begotten Son of God, Begotten of the Father Very God Before All Ages, by Whom All Things Were Made.</strong></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews 1:1</a></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who at sundry times and in various manners spoke in times past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, has in these last days spoken unto us by His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<p>1. That we have hope in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has been sufficiently shown, according to our ability, in what we delivered to you yesterday. But we must not simply <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ Jesus nor receive Him as one of the many who are improperly called Christs.  For they were figurative Christs, but He is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ; not having risen by advancement  from among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to the Priesthood, but ever having the dignity of the Priesthood from the Father.  And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the Faith guarding us beforehand lest we should suppose Him to be one of the ordinary Christs, adds to the profession of the Faith, that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> In One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Only-Begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>2. And again on hearing of a <q>Son,</q> think not of an adopted son but a Son by nature , an Only-begotten Son, having no brother. For this is the reason why He is called <q>Only-begotten,</q> because in the dignity of the Godhead, and His generation from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He has no brother. But we call Him the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, not of ourselves, but because the Father Himself named Christ  His Son : and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> name is that which is set by fathers upon their children. </p>

<p>3. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> erewhile became Man, but by the many He was unknown. Wishing, therefore, to teach that which was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, He called together His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and asked them, <em>Whom do men say that I, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, am</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311239"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;13:16</a></span>? &mdash; not from vain-<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but wishing to show them the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, lest dwelling with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Only-begotten of God , they should think lightly of Him as if He were some mere man. And when they answered that some said Elias, and some Jeremias, He said to them, They may be excused for not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, but you, My Apostles, who in My name cleanse <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, and cast out devils, and raise the dead, ought not to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Him, through whom you do these wondrous works. And when they all became silent (for the matter was too high for man to learn), Peter, the foremost of the Apostles and chief herald  of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, neither aided by cunning invention, nor persuaded by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasoning, but enlightened in his mind from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, says to Him, <em>You are the Christ</em>, not only so, but <em>the Son of the living God</em>. And there follows a blessing upon his speech (for in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it was above man), and as a seal upon what he had said, that it was the Father who had revealed it to him. For the Saviour says, <em>Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but My Father which is in heaven</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311242"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;16:17</a></span> He therefore who acknowledges <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, partakes of this blessedness; but he who denies the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is a poor and miserable man.</p>

<p>4. Again, I say, on hearing of a Son, understand  it not merely in an improper sense, but as a Son in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a Son by nature, without beginning ; not as having come out of bondage into a higher state of adoption , but a Son <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> begotten by an inscrutable and incomprehensible generation. And in like manner on hearing of the First-born , think not that this is after the manner of men; for the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have other brothers also. And it is somewhere written, <em><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is My son, My <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311246"><a href="../bible/exo004.htm#verse22">Exodus&nbsp;4:22</a></span> But <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is, as Reuben was, a <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> son rejected: for Reuben went up to his father's couch; and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> cast his Father's Son out of the vineyard, and crucified Him.</p>

<p>To others also the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <em>You are the sons of the Lord your God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311247"><a href="../bible/deu014.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy&nbsp;14:1</a></span>: and in another place, <em>I have said, You are gods, and you are all sons of the Most High</em>.  <em>I have said</em>, not, <q>I have begotten.</q> They, when God so <em>said</em>, received the sonship, which before they had not: but He was not begotten to be other than He was before; but was begotten from the beginning Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, being above all beginning and all ages, Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in all things like  to Him who begot Him, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> of a Father <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, Life of Life begotten, and Light of Light, and Truth of Truth, and Wisdom of the Wise, and King of King, and God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Power of Power. </p>

<p>5. If then thou hear the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> saying, <em>The book of the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Son of David, the Son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note311251"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;1:1</a></span>, understand <q>according to the flesh.</q> For He is the Son of David <em>at the end of the ages</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311252"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse26">Hebrews&nbsp;9:26</a></span>, but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Before All Ages, without beginning.  The one, which before He had not, He received; but the other, which He has, He has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> as begotten of the Father. Two fathers He has: one, David, according to the flesh, and one, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His Father in a Divine manner.  As the Son of David, He is subject to time, and to handling, and to genealogical descent: but as Son according to the Godhead , He is subject neither to time nor to place, nor to genealogical descent: for <em>His generation who shall declare</em> ? <em>God is a Spirit</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311257"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;4:24</a></span>; He who is a Spirit has spiritually begotten, as being incorporeal, an inscrutable and incomprehensible generation. The Son Himself says of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <em>The Lord said unto Me, You are My Son, today have I begotten You</em>.  Now this <em>today</em> is not recent, but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>: a timeless today, before all ages. <em>From the womb, before the morning star, have I begotten You</em>. </p>

<p>6. Believe thou therefore on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a Son Only-Begotten, according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which says, <em>For God so loved the world, that He gave His Only-begotten Son, that whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311260"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;3:16</a></span> And again, <em>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in the Son is not judged, but has passed out of death into life</em>.  <em>But he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not the Son shall not see life, but the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God abides on him</em>.  And John testified concerning Him, saying, <em>And we beheld His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as of the only-begotten from the father&mdash;full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></em> : at whom the devils trembled and said, <em>Ah! What have we to do with You, Jesus, Thou Son of the living God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311264"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;4:34</a></span> .</p>

<p>7. He is then the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> by nature and not by adoption , begotten of the Father. <em>And he that loves Him that begot, loves Him also that is begotten of Him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311266"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:1</a></span>; but he that despises Him that is begotten casts back the insult upon Him who begot. And whenever thou hear of God begetting, sink not down in thought to bodily things, nor think of a corruptible generation, lest you be guilty of impiety. <em>God is a Spirit</em> , His generation is spiritual: for bodies beget bodies, and for the generation of bodies time needs must intervene; but time intervenes not in the generation of the Son from the Father. And in our case what is begotten is begotten imperfect: but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was begotten perfect; for what He is now, that is He also from the beginning , begotten without beginning. We are begotten so as to pass from infantile <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to a state of reason: your generation, O man, is imperfect, for your growth is progressive. But think not that it is thus in His case, nor impute infirmity to Him who has begotten. For if that which He begot was imperfect, and acquired its perfection in time, you are imputing infirmity to Him who has begotten; if so be, the Father did not bestow from the beginning that which, as you say, time bestowed afterwards. </p>

<p>8. Think not therefore that this generation is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, nor as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> begot Isaac. For in begetting Isaac, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> begot not what he would, but what another granted. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father's begetting there is neither <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> nor intermediate deliberation.  For to say that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what He was begetting is the greatest impiety; and it is no less impious to say, that after deliberation in time He then became a Father. For God was not previously without a Son, and afterwards in time became a Father; but has the Son <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, having begotten Him not as men beget men, but as Himself only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, who begot Him before all ages Very God.</p>

<p>9. For the Father being Very God begot the Son like Himself, Very God ; not as teachers beget <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says to some, <em>For in Christ Jesus I begot you through the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311272"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:15</a></span> For in this case he who was not a son by nature became a son by discipleship, but in the former case He was a Son by nature, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son. Not as you, who are to be illuminated, are now becoming sons of God: for you also become sons, but by adoption of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as it is written, <em>But as many as received Him, to them gave He the right to become children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His name: which were begotten not of blood, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311273"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;1:12-13</a></span> And we indeed are begotten of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but not thus was Christ begotten of the Father. For at the time of His Baptism addressing Him, and saying, <em>This is My Son</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311274"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;3:17</a></span>, He did not say, <q>This has now become My Son,</q> but, <em>This is My Son;</em> that He might make manifest, that even before the operation of Baptism He was a Son.</p>

<p>10. The Father begot the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, not as among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> mind begets word. For the mind is substantially existent in us; but the word when spoken is dispersed into the air and comes to an end.  But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ to have been begotten not as a word pronounced , but as a Word substantially existing  and living; not spoken by the lips, and dispersed, but begotten of the Father <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> and ineffably, in substance.  For, <em>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311279"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span>, sitting at God's right hand&mdash;the Word understanding the Father's will, and creating all things at His bidding: the Word, which came down and went up; for the word of utterance when spoken comes not down, nor goes up; the Word speaking and saying, <em>The things which I have seen with My Father, these I speak</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311280"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;8:38</a></span>: the Word possessed of power, and reigning over all things: for <em>the Father has committed all things unto the Son</em>. </p>

<p>11. The Father then begot Him not in such wise as any man could understand, but as Himself only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. For we profess not to tell in what manner He begot Him, but we insist that it was not in this manner. And not we only are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the generation of the Son from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but so is every created nature. <em>Speak to the earth, if perchance it may teach you</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311282"><a href="../bible/job012.htm#verse8">Job&nbsp;12:8</a></span>: and though thou inquire of all things which are upon the earth, they shall not be able to tell you. For the earth cannot tell the substance of Him who is its own potter and fashioner. Nor is the earth alone <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, but the sun also : for the sun was created on the fourth day, without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what had been made in the three days before him; and he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the things made in the three days before him, cannot tell forth the Maker Himself. <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> will not declare this: for at the Father's bidding <em>the heaven also was like smoke established</em>  by Christ. Nor shall <em>the heaven of heavens</em> declare this, <em>nor the waters which are above the heavens</em>.  Why then art you cast down, O man, at being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of that which even the heavens <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not? Nay, not only are the heavens <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this generation, but also every angelic nature. For if any one should ascend, were it possible, into the first heaven, and perceiving the ranks of the Angels there should approach and ask them how God begot His own Son, they would say perhaps, <q>We have above us beings greater and higher; ask them.</q> Go up to the second heaven and the third; attain, if you can, to Thrones, and Dominions, and Principalities, and Powers: and even if any one should reach them, which is impossible, they also would decline the explanation, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not.</p>

<p>12. For my part, I have ever wondered at the curiosity of the bold men, who by their imagined reverence fall into impiety. For though they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of Thrones, and Dominions, and Principalities, and Powers, the workmanship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they attempt to scrutinise their Creator Himself. Tell me first, O most daring man, wherein does Throne differ from Dominion, and then scrutinise what pertains to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Tell me what is a Principality, and what a Power, and what a Virtue, and what an Angel: and then search out their Creator, <em>for all things were made by Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311286"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> But you will not, or you can not ask Thrones or Dominions. What else is there that <em><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the deep things of God <span class="stiki" id="note311287"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:10-11</a></span> </em>, save only the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who spoke the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>? But not even the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself has spoken in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> concerning the generation of the Son from the Father. Why then do you busy yourself about things which not even the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has written in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>? Thou that <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> not the things which are written, busiest you yourself about the things which are not written? There are many questions in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>; what is written we comprehend not, why do we busy ourselves about what is not written? It is sufficient for us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God has begotten One Only Son.</p>

<p>13. Be not ashamed to confess your <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, since you share <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> with Angels. Only He who begot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him who was begotten, and He who is begotten of Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him who begot. He who begot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what He begot: and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> also testify that He who was begotten is God.  For <em>as the Father has life in Himself, so also has He given to the Son to have life in Himself</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311289"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;5:26</a></span>; and, <em>that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, even as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father</em> ; and, <em>as the Father quickens</em> whom He will, even so the Son quickens whom He will.  Neither He who begot suffered any loss, nor is anything lacking to Him who was begotten (I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have said these things many times, but it is for your safety that they are said so often): neither has He who begot, a Father, nor He who was begotten, a brother. Neither was He who begot changed into the Son , nor did He who was begotten become the Father.  Of One Only Father there is One Only-begotten Son: neither two Unbegotten , nor two Only-begotten; but One Father, Unbegotten (for He is Unbegotten who has no father); and One Son, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> begotten of the Father; begotten not in time, but before all ages; not increased by advancement, but begotten that which He now is.</p>

<p>14. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> then In the Only-Begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Who Was Begotten of the Father Very God. For the True God begets not a false god, as we have said, nor did He deliberate and afterwards beget ; but He begot <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, and much more swiftly than our words or thoughts: for we speaking in time, consume time; but in the case of the Divine Power, the generation is timeless. And as I have often said, He did not bring forth the Son from non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> into being, nor take the non-existent into sonship : but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, being Eternal, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> and ineffably begot One Only Son, who has no brother. Nor are there two first principles; but the Father is <em>the head of the Son</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311297"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span>; the beginning is One. For the Father begot the Son Very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, called <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>; and <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> <em>being interpreted is, God with us</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311298"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;1:23</a></span> .</p>

<p>15. And would you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He who was begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and afterwards became man, is God? Hear the Prophet saying, <em>This is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, none other shall be accounted of in comparison with Him. He has found out every way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and given it to Jacob His servant, and to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His beloved. Afterwards He was seen on earth, and conversed among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a></em>.  Do you see herein God become man, after the giving of the law by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? Hear also a second testimony to Christ's Deity, that which has just now been read, <em>Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311300"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse8">Hebrews&nbsp;1:8</a></span> For lest, because of His presence here in the flesh, He should be thought to have been advanced after this to the Godhead, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says plainly, <em>Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above Your fellows</em>.  Do you see Christ as God anointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father?</p>

<p>16. Would you receive yet a third testimony to Christ's Godhead? Hear Esaias saying, <em><a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> has laboured, and the merchandise of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>:</em> and soon after, <em>In You shall they make supplication, because God is in You, and there is no God save You. For You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Saviour</em>.  You see that the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having in Himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father: saying almost the very same which He has said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>: <em>The Father is in Me, and I am in the Father</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311303"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;14:11</a></span> He says not, I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but <em>the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father</em>. And again He said not, I and the Father am  one, but, <em>I and the Father am one</em>, that we should neither separate them, nor make a confusion of Son-Father.  One they are because of the dignity pertaining to the Godhead, since God begot God. One in respect of their kingdom; for the Father reigns not over these, and the Son over those, lifting Himself up against His Father like Absalom: but the kingdom of the Father is likewise the kingdom of the Son. One they are, because there is no discord nor division between them: for what things the Father wills, the Son wills the same. One, because the creative works of Christ are no other than the Father's; for the creation of all things is one, the Father having made them through the Son: <em>For He spoke, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created</em>, says the Psalmist.  For He who speaks, speaks to one who hears: and He who commands, gives His commandment to one who is present with Him.</p>

<p>17. The Son then is Very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having the Father in Himself, not changed into the Father; for the Father was not made man, but the Son. For let the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be freely spoken.  The Father suffered not for us, but the Father sent Him who suffered. Neither let us say, There was a time when the Son was not; nor let us admit a Son who is the Father : but let us walk in the king's highway; let us turn aside neither on the left hand nor on the right. Neither from thinking to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, let us call Him the Father; nor from thinking to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> the Son to be some one of the creatures. But let One Father be worshipped through One Son, and let not their worship be separated. Let One Son be proclaimed, sitting at the right hand of the Father before all ages: sharing His throne not by advancement in time after His Passion, but by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> possession.</p>

<p>18. <em>He who has seen the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, has seen the Father</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311309"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9</a></span>: for in all things the Son is like to Him who begot Him ; begotten Life of Life and Light of Light, Power of Power, God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the characteristics of the Godhead are unchangeable  in the Son; and he who is counted worthy to behold Godhead in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, attains to the fruition of the Father. This is not my word, but that of the Only-begotten: <em>Have I been so long time with you, and have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, Philip? He that has seen Me, has seen the Father</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311312"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9</a></span> And to be brief, let us neither separate them, nor make a confusion : neither say thou ever that the Son is foreign to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor admit those who say that the Father is at one time Father, and at another Son: for these are strange and impious statements, and not the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But the Father having begotten the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, remained the Father and is not changed. He begot Wisdom, yet lost not wisdom Himself; and begot Power, yet became not weak: He begot <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but lost not His own Godhead: and neither did He lose anything Himself by diminution or change; nor has He who was begotten any thing wanting. Perfect is He who begot, Perfect that which was begotten: God was He who begot, God He who was begotten; God of all Himself, yet entitling the Father His own God. For He is not ashamed to say, I <em>ascend unto My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311314"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span> .</p>

<p>19. But lest you should think that He is in a like sense Father of the Son and of the creatures, Christ drew a distinction in what follows. For He said not, <q>I ascend to our Father,</q> lest the creatures should be made fellows of the Only-begotten; but He said, <em>My Father and your Father</em>; in one way Mine, by nature; in another yours, by adoption. And again, <em>to my God and your God</em>, in one way Mine, as His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and Only-begotten Son, and in another way yours, as His workmanship.  The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> then is Very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ineffably begotten before all ages (for I say the same things often to you, that it may be graven upon your mind). This also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that God has a Son: but about the manner be not curious, for by searching you will not find. Exalt not yourself, lest you fall: <em>think upon those things only which have been commanded you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311316"><a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse22">Sirach&nbsp;3:22</a></span> Tell me first what He is who begot, and then learn that which He begot; but if you can not conceive the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Him who has begotten, search not curiously into the manner of that which is begotten.</p>

<p>20. For godliness it suffices you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, as we have said, that God has One Only Son, One naturally begotten; who began not His being when He was born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, but Before All Ages. For hear the Prophet Micah saying, <em>And thou, <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, house of Ephrata, art little to be among the thousands of Judah. Out of you shall come forth unto Me a Ruler, who shall feed My people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and His goings forth are from the beginning, from days of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a></em>.  Think not then of Him who is now come forth out of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> , but worship Him who was <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> begotten of the Father. Suffer none to speak of a beginning of the Son in time, but as a timeless Beginning acknowledge the Father. For the Father is the Beginning of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, timeless, incomprehensible, without beginning.  The fountain of the river of righteousness, even of the Only-begotten, is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who begot Him as Himself only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. And would you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is King Eternal? Hear Him again saying, <em>Your father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311320"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;8:56</a></span> And then, when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> received this hardly, He says what to them was still harder, <em>Before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was, I am</em>.  And again He says to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <em>And now, Father, glorify Thou Me with Your own self, with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had with You before the world was</em>.  He says plainly, <q>before the world was, I had the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is with You.</q> And again when He says, <em>For You <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> Me before the foundation of the world</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311323"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;17:24</a></span>, He plainly declares, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I have with you is from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.</q></p>

<p>21. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> then In One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Only-Begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Begotten of His Father Very God Before All Worlds, by Whom All Things Were Made. For <em>whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers, all things were made through Him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311324"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse16">Colossians&nbsp;1:16</a></span>, and of things created none is exempted from His authority. Silenced be every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which brings in different creators and makers of the world; silenced the tongue which blasphemes the Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; let them be silenced who say that the sun is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, for He is the sun's Creator, not the sun which we see.  Silenced be they who say that the world is the workmanship of Angels , who wish to steal away the dignity of the Only-begotten. For whether visible or invisible, whether thrones or dominions, or anything that is named, all things were made by Christ. He reigns over the things which have been made by Him, not having seized another's spoils, but reigning over His own workmanship, even as the Evangelist John has said, <em>All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311327"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> All things were made by Him, the Father working by the Son.</p>

<p>22. I wish to give also a certain illustration of what I am saying, but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is feeble; for of things visible what can be an exact illustration of the Divine Power? But nevertheless as feeble be it spoken by the feeble to the feeble. For just as any king, whose son was a king, if he wished to form a city, might suggest to his son, his partner in the kingdom, the form of the city, and he having received the pattern, brings the design to completion; so, when the Father wished to form all things, the Son created all things at the Father's bidding, that the act of bidding might secure to the Father His absolute authority , and yet the Son in turn might have authority over His own workmanship, and neither the Father be separated from the lordship over His own works, nor the Son rule over things created by others, but by Himself. For, as I have said, Angels did not create the world, but the Only-begotten Son, begotten, as I have said, before all ages, By Whom All Things Were Made, nothing having been excepted from His creation. And let this suffice to have been spoken by us so far, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>23. But let us now recur to our profession of the Faith, and so for the present finish our discourse. Christ made all things, whether thou speak of Angels, or Archangels, of Dominions, or Thrones. Not that the Father wanted strength to create the works Himself, but because He willed that the Son should reign over His own workmanship, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself giving Him the design of the things to be made. For honouring His own Father the Only-begotten says, <em>The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for what things soever He does, these also does the Son likewise</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311329"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;5:19</a></span> And again, <em>My Father works hitherto, and I work</em> , there being no opposition in those who work. <em>For all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine</em>, says the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.  And this we may certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the Old and New Testaments. For He who said, <em>Let us <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">make</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in our image and after our likeness</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311332"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span>, was certainly speaking to some one present. But clearest of all are the Psalmist's words, <em>He spoke and they were made; He commanded, and they were created</em> , as if the Father commanded and spoke, and the Son made all things at the Father's bidding. And this Job said <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>, <em>Which alone spread out the heaven, and walks upon the sea as on firm ground</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311334"><a href="../bible/job009.htm#verse8">Job&nbsp;9:8</a></span>; signifying to those who understand that He who when present here walked upon the sea is also He who aforetime made the heavens. And again the Lord says, <em>Or did Thou take earth, and fashion clay into a living being</em> ? Then afterwards, <em>Are the gates of death opened to You through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and did the door-keepers of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shudder at sight of You</em> ? Thus signifying that He who through loving-kindness descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, also in the beginning made man out of clay.</p>

<p>24. Christ then is the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and Maker of the world. For <em>He was in the world, and the world was made by Him;</em> and <em>He came unto His own</em>, as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> teaches us. <span class="stiki" id="note311337"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;1:10-11</a></span> And not only of the things which are seen, but also of the things which are not seen, is Christ the Maker at the Father's bidding. For <em>in Him</em>, according to the Apostle, <em>were all things created that are in the heavens, and that are upon the earth, things visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things have been created by Him and for Him; and He is before all, and</em>  <em>in Him all things consist</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311338"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse16">Colossians&nbsp;1:16-17</a></span> Even if you speak of the worlds, of these also <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the Maker by the Father's bidding. For <em>in these last days God spoke unto us by His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds <span class="stiki" id="note311339"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse2">Hebrews&nbsp;1:2</a></span> </em>. To whom be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, might, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
