<p><strong>On the Clause, And Shall Come in Glory to Judge the Quick and the Dead; Of Whose Kingdom There Shall Be No End.</strong></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse9">Daniel 7:9-14</a></p>

<p> <em>I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit</em>, and then, <em>I saw in a vision of the night, and behold one like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> came with the clouds of heaven, etc.</em></p>

<p>1. We preach not one advent only of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but a second also, far more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than the former. For the former gave a view of His patience; but the latter brings with it the crown of a divine kingdom. For all things, for the most part, are twofold in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>: a twofold generation; one, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before the ages; and one, of a Virgin, at the close of the ages: His descents twofold; one, the unobserved, <em>like rain on a fleece</em> ; and a second His open coming, which is to be. In His former advent, He was wrapped in swaddling clothes in the <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>; in His second, He <em>covers Himself with light as with a garment</em>.  In His first coming, <em>He endured the Cross, despising shame</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311813"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse2">Hebrews&nbsp;12:2</a></span>; in His second, He comes attended by a host of Angels, receiving <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.  We rest not then upon His first advent only, but look also for His second. And as at His first coming we said, <em>Blessed is He that comes in the Name of the Lord</em> , so will we repeat the same at His second coming; that when with Angels we meet our Master, we may worship Him and say, <em>Blessed is He that comes in the Name of the Lord</em>. The Saviour comes, not to be judged again, but to judge them who judged Him; He who before held His peace when judged , shall remind the transgressors who did those daring <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> at the Cross, and shall say, <em>These things have you done, and I kept silence</em>.  Then, He came because of a divine dispensation, teaching men with persuasion; but this time they will of necessity have Him for their King, even though they wish it not.</p>

<p>2. And concerning these two comings, Malachi the Prophet says, <em>And the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to His temple</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311818"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse1">Malachi&nbsp;3:1-3</a></span>; behold one coming. And again of the second coming he says, <em>And the Messenger of the covenant whom you delight in. Behold, He comes, says</em>  <em>the Lord Almighty. But who shall abide the day of His coming? Or who shall stand when He appears? Because He comes in like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' herb; and He shall sit as a refiner and purifier</em>. And immediately after the Saviour Himself says, <em>And I will draw near to you in judgment; and I will be a swift <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against the sorcerers, and against the adulteresses, and against those who <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> in My Name</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311820"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse5">Malachi&nbsp;3:5</a></span>, and the rest. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> warning us beforehand says, <em>If any man builds on the foundation gold, and silver, and precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311821"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:12</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> these two comings, when writing to Titus and saying, <em>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God has appeared which brings <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, instructing us that, denying ungodliness and worldly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, we should live soberly, and godly, and righteously in this present world; looking for the blessed hope, and appearing of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the great God and our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em>.  You see how he spoke of a first, for which he gives thanks; and of a second, to which we look forward. Therefore the words also of the Faith which we are announcing were just now delivered thus ; that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, who also ascended into the heavens, and sat down on the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and shall come in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to judge quick and dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.</p>

<p>3. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, then, comes from heaven; and He comes with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> at the end of this world, in the last day. For of this world there is to be an end, and this created world is to be re-made anew.  For since corruption, <em>and theft, and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a></em>, and every sort of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <em>have been poured forth over the earth, and blood has been mingled with blood</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311825"><a href="../bible/hos004.htm#verse2">Hosea&nbsp;4:2</a></span> in the world, therefore, that this wondrous dwelling-place may not remain filled with iniquity, this world passes away, that the fairer world may be made manifest. And would you receive the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this out of the words of Scripture? Listen to Esaias, saying, <em>And the heaven shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all the stars shall fall, as leaves from a vine, and as leaves fall from a fig-tree <span class="stiki" id="note311826"><a href="../bible/isa034.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;34:4</a></span> </em>. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> also says, <em>The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven <span class="stiki" id="note311827"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;24:29</a></span> </em>. Let us not sorrow, as if we alone died; the stars also shall die; but perhaps rise again. And the Lord rolls up the heavens, not that He may destroy them, but that He may raise them up again more beautiful. Hear David the Prophet saying, <em>You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands; they shall perish, but You remain</em>.  But some one will say, Behold, he says plainly that <em>they shall perish</em>. Hear in what sense he says, <em>they shall perish</em>; it is plain from what follows; <em>And they all shall wax old as does a garment; and as a vesture shall Thou fold them up, and they shall be changed</em>. For as a man is said to <q>perish,</q> according to that which is written, <em>Behold, how the righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311829"><a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;57:1</a></span>, and this, though the resurrection is looked for; so we look for a resurrection, as it were, of the heavens also. <em>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311830"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse31">Joel&nbsp;2:31</a></span> Here let converts from the Manichees gain instruction, and no longer make those lights their gods; nor impiously think, that this sun which shall be darkened is Christ.  And again hear the Lord saying, <em><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311832"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;24:35</a></span>; for the creatures are not as precious as the Master's words.</p>

<p>4. The things then which are seen shall pass away, and there shall come the things which are looked for, things fairer than the present; but as to the time let no one be curious. For <em>it is not for you</em>, He says, <em>to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> times or seasons, which the Father has put in His own power</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311833"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse7">Acts&nbsp;1:7</a></span> And venture not thou to declare when these things shall be, nor on the other hand supinely slumber. For he says, <em>Watch, for in such an hour as you expect not the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> comes</em>.  But since it was needful for us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the signs of the end, and since we are looking for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, therefore, that we may not die deceived and be led astray by that false <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, the Apostles, moved by the divine will, address themselves by a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> arrangement to the True Teacher, and say, <em>Tell us, when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the world</em> ? We look for You to come again, but <em><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> transforms himself into an Angel of light</em>; put us therefore on our guard, that we may not worship another instead of You. And He, opening His divine and blessed mouth, says, <em>Take heed that no man mislead you</em>. Do you also, my hearers, as seeing Him now with the eyes of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, hear Him saying the same things to you; <em>Take heed that no man mislead you</em>. And this word exhorts you all to give heed to what is spoken; for it is not a history of things gone by, but a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of things future, and which will surely come. Not that we prophesy, for we are unworthy; but that the things which are written will be set before you, and the signs declared. Observe thou, which of them have already come to pass, and which yet remain; and make yourself safe.</p>

<p>5. <em>Take heed that no man mislead you: for many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ, and shall mislead many</em>. This has happened in part: for already <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> has said this, and Menander , and some others of the godless leaders of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; and others will say it in our days, or after us.</p>

<p>6. A second sign. <em>And you shall hear of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and rumours of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a></em>.  Is there then at this time <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Persians and Romans for Mesopotamia, or no? Does nation rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom, or no? <em>And there shall be famines and pesti</em> <em>lences and earthquakes in various places</em>. These things have already come to pass; and again, <em>And fearful sights from heaven, and mighty storms</em>.  <em>Watch therefore</em>, He says; <em>for you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not at what hour your Lord does come</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311839"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;24:42</a></span> .</p>

<p>7. But we seek our own sign of His coming; we Churchmen seek a sign proper to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  And the Saviour says, <em>And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> one another</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311841"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;24:10</a></span> If you hear that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> advance against <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> against <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> even unto blood, be not troubled ; for it has been written before. Heed not the things now happening, but the things which are written; and even though I who teach you perish, you shall not also perish with me; nay, even a hearer may become better than his teacher, and he who came last may be first, since even those about the eleventh hour the Master receives. If among Apostles there was found treason, do you wonder that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of brethren is found among <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>? But the sign concerns not only rulers, but the people also; for He says, <em>And because iniquity shall abound, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the many shall wax cold</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311843"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;24:12</a></span> Will any then among those present boast that he entertains friendship unfeigned towards his neighbour? Do not the lips often <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, and the countenance smile, and the eyes brighten forsooth, while the heart is planning guile, and the man is plotting mischief with words of peace?</p>

<p>8. You have this sign also: <em>And this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> unto all nations, and then shall the end come</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311844"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;24:14</a></span> And as we see, nearly the whole world is now filled with the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>9. And what comes to pass after this? He says next, <em>When therefore you see the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination of desolation</a>, which was spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, standing in the Holy Place, let him that reads understand</em>.  And again, <em>Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, or, Lo, there; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it not</em>.  Hatred of the brethren makes room next for <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> prepares beforehand the divisions among the people, that he who is to come may be acceptable to them. But God forbid that any of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> servants here, or elsewhere, should run over to the enemy! Writing concerning this matter, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> gave a manifest sign, saying, <em>For that day shall not come, except there came first the falling away, and the man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that is worshipped; so that he sits in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, showing himself that he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Do you not remember that when I was yet with you, I told you these things? And now you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that which restrains, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season. For the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of iniquity does already work, only there is one that restrains now, until he be taken out of the way. And then shall the lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming. Even him, whose coming is after the working of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that are perishing</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311847"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:3-10</a></span> Thus wrote <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and now is the falling away. For men have fallen away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> ; and some preach the identity of the Son with the Father , and others dare to say that Christ was brought into being out of nothing.  And formerly the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were manifest; but now the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is filled with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in disguise.  For men have fallen away from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <em>have itching ears</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311852"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:3</a></span> Is it a plausible discourse? All listen to it gladly. Is it a word of correction? All turn away from it. Most have departed from right words, and rather choose the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, than desire the good.  This therefore is <em>the falling away</em>, and the enemy is soon to be looked for: and meanwhile he has in part begun to send forth his own forerunners , that he may then come prepared upon the prey. Look therefore to yourself, O man, and make safe your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The Church now charges you before the Living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; she declares to you the things concerning <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> before they arrive. Whether they will happen in your time we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, or whether they will happen after you we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; but it is well that, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> these things, you should make yourself secure beforehand.</p>

<p>10. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ, the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, comes no more from the earth. If any come making false shows  in the wilderness, go not forth; if they say, <em>Lo, here is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, Lo, there, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it not</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311856"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;24:23</a></span> Look no longer downwards and to the earth; for the Lord descends from heaven; not alone as before, but with many, escorted by tens of thousands of Angels; nor secretly as the dew on the fleece ; but shining forth openly as the lightning. For He has said Himself, <em>As the lightning comes out of the east, and shines even unto the west, so shall also the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> be</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311858"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;24:27</a></span>; and again, <em>And they shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> coming upon the clouds with power and great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and He shall send forth His Angels with a great trumpet</em> ; and the rest.</p>

<p>11. But as, when formerly He was to take man's nature, and God was expected to be born of a Virgin, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> created prejudice against this, by craftily preparing among idol-worshippers  fables of false gods, begetting and begotten of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, that, the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> having come first, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as he supposed, might be disbelieved; so now, since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ is to come a second time, the adversary, taking occasion by  the expectation of the simple, and especially of them of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, brings in a certain man who is a magician , and most expert in sorceries and enchantments of beguiling craftiness; who shall seize for himself the power of the Roman empire, and shall <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> style himself Christ; by this name of Christ deceiving the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who are looking for the Anointed , and seducing those of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by his magical illusions.</p>

<p>12. But this aforesaid <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> is to come when the times of the Roman empire shall have been fulfilled, and the end of the world is now drawing near.  There shall rise up together ten kings of the Romans, reigning in different parts perhaps, but all about the same time; and after these an eleventh, the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, who by his magical craft shall seize upon the Roman power; and of the kings who reigned before him, <em>three he shall <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a></em> , and the remaining seven he shall keep in subjection to himself. At first indeed he will put on a show of mildness (as though he were a learned and discreet person), and of soberness and benevolence : and by the lying signs and wonders of his magical deceit  having beguiled the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as though he were the expected Christ, he shall afterwards be characterized by all kinds of crimes of inhumanity and lawlessness, so as to outdo all unrighteous and ungodly men who have gone before him; displaying against all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but especially against us <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, a spirit murderous and most cruel, merciless and crafty.  And after perpetrating such things for three years and six months only, he shall be destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> second advent from heaven of the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, our Lord and Saviour Jesus, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ, who shall slay <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> <em>with the breath of His mouth</em> , and shall deliver him over to the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</p>

<p>13. Now these things we teach, not of our own invention, but having learned them out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> used in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> , and chiefly from the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Daniel just now read; as Gabriel also the Archangel interpreted it, speaking thus: <em>The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall surpass all kingdoms</em>.  And that this kingdom is that of the Romans, has been the tradition of the Church's interpreters. For as the first kingdom which became renowned was that of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and the second, that of the Medes and Persians together, and after these, that of the Macedonians was the third, so the fourth kingdom now is that of the Romans.  Then Gabriel goes on to interpret, saying, <em>His ten horns are ten kings that shall arise; and another king shall rise up after them, who shall surpass in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> all who were before him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311873"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse24">Daniel&nbsp;7:24</a></span>; (he says, not only the ten, but also all who have been before him;) <em>and he shall subdue three kings</em>; manifestly out of the ten former kings: but it is plain that by subduing three of these ten, he will become the eighth king; <em>and he shall speak words against the Most High</em>.  A blasphemer the man is and lawless, not having received the kingdom from his fathers, but having usurped the power by means of sorcery.</p>

<p>14. And who is this, and from what sort of working? Interpret to us, O <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. <em>Whose coming</em>, he says, <em>is after the working of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, with all power and signs and lying wonders</em> ; implying, that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> has used him as an instrument, working in his own person through him; for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that his judgment shall now no longer have respite, he wages <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> no more by his ministers, as is his wont, but henceforth by himself more openly.  And <em>with all signs and lying wonders</em>; for the father of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> will make a show  of the works of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, that the multitudes may think that they see a dead man raised, who is not raised, and lame men walking, and blind men seeing, when the cure has not been wrought.</p>

<p>15. And again he says, <em>Who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that is worshipped</em>; (<em>against every God</em>; <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> forsooth will abhor the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>,) <em>so that he seats himself in the temple of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311878"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:4</a></span> What temple then? He means, the Temple of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> which has been destroyed. For God forbid that it should be the one in which we are! Why say we this? That we may not be supposed to favour ourselves. For if he comes to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as Christ, and desires to be worshipped by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he will make great account of the Temple, that he may more completely beguile them; making it supposed that he is the man of the race of David, who shall build up the Temple which was erected by Solomon.  And <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> will come at the time when there shall not be left one stone upon another in the Temple of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, according to the doom pronounced by our Saviour ; for when, either decay of time, or demolition ensuing on pretence of new buildings, or from any other causes, shall have overthrown all the stones, I mean not merely of the outer circuit, but of the inner shrine also, where the Cherubim were, then shall he come <em>with all signs and lying wonders</em>, exalting himself against all <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; at first indeed making a pretence of benevolence, but afterwards displaying his relentless temper, and that chiefly against the Saints of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For he says, <em>I beheld, and the same horn made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a></em> ; and again elsewhere, <em>there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation upon earth, even to that same time</em>.  Dreadful is that beast, a mighty dragon, unconquerable by man, ready to devour; concerning whom though we have more things to speak out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, yet we will content ourselves at present with thus much, in order to keep within compass.</p>

<p>16. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the greatness of the adversary grants indulgence to the godly, saying, <em>Then let them which be in Jud&aelig;a flee to the mountains</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311883"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;24:16</a></span> But if any man is conscious that he is very stout-hearted, to encounter <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, let him stand (for I do not despair of the Church's nerves), and let him say, <em>Who shall separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ and the rest</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311884"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse35">Romans&nbsp;8:35</a></span>? But, let those of us who are fearful provide for our own safety; and those who are of a good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, stand fast: <em>for then shall be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311885"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;24:21</a></span> But thanks be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who has confined the greatness of that tribulation to a few days; for He says, <em>But for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened</em> ; and <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> shall reign for three years and a half only. We speak not from <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> books, but from Daniel; for he says, <em>And they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time</em>  <em>. A time</em> is the one year in which his coming shall for a while have increase; and <em>the times</em> are the remaining two years of iniquity, making up the sum of the three years; and <em>the half a time</em> is the six months. And again in another place Daniel says the same thing, <em>And he swore by Him that lives for ever that it shall be for a time, and times, and half a time</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311888"><a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse7">Daniel&nbsp;12:7</a></span> And some perhaps have referred what follows also to this; namely, <em>a thousand two hundred and ninety days</em> ; and this, <em>Blessed is he that endures and comes to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days</em>.  For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we must hide ourselves and flee; for perhaps <em>we shall not have gone over the cities of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, till the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> be come</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311891"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;10:23</a></span> .</p>

<p>17. Who then is the blessed man, that shall at that time devoutly <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> for Christ? For I say that the Martyrs of that time excel all <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. For the Martyrs hitherto have wrestled with men only; but in the time of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> they shall do battle with <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> in his own person.  And former <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> kings only <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>; they did not pretend to raise the dead, nor did they make false shows  of signs and wonders. But in his time there shall be the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> inducement both of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and of deceit, <em>so that if it be possible the very elect shall be deceived</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311894"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;24:24</a></span> Let it never enter into the heart of any then alive to ask, <q>What did Christ more? For by what power does this man work these things? Were it not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, He would not have allowed them.</q> The Apostle warns you, and says beforehand, <em>And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> God shall send them a working of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a></em>; (<em>send</em>, that is, <em>shall allow to happen</em>;) not that they might make excuse, but <em>that they might be condemned</em>.  Wherefore? <em>They</em>, he says, <em>who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></em>, that is, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ, <em>but had pleasure in unrighteousness</em>, that is, in <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. But as in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> which happen from time to time, so also then God will permit these things, not because He wants power to hinder them, but because according to His wont He will through patience crown His own champions like as He did His Prophets and Apostles; to the end that having toiled for a little while they may inherit the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, according to that which Daniel says, <em>And at that time your people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book</em> (manifestly, the book of life); <em>and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and same to shame and everlasting contempt; and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and of the many righteous</em> , <em>as the stars for ever and ever</em>.</p>

<p>18. Guard yourself then, O man; you have the signs of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>; and remember them not only yourself, but impart them also freely to all. If you have a child according to the flesh, admonish him of this now; if you have begotten one through catechizing , put him also on his guard, lest he receive the false one as the True. For the <em><a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of iniquity does already work</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311898"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> these <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the nations ; I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the schisms of the Churches; I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the mutual <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the brethren. But enough on this subject; only God forbid that it should be fulfilled in our days; nevertheless, let us be on our guard. And thus much concerning <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>.</p>

<p>19. But let us wait and look for the Lord's coming upon the clouds from heaven. Then shall Angelic trumpets sound; <em>the dead in Christ shall rise first</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311900"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:16</a></span>&mdash;the godly <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are alive shall be caught up in the clouds, receiving as the reward of their labours more than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, inasmuch as theirs was a more than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> strife; according as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> writes, saying, <em>For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord</em>. </p>

<p>20. This coming of the Lord, and the end of the world, were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the Preacher; who says, <em>Rejoice, O young man, in your youth</em>, and the rest ; <em>Therefore remove <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>  from your heart, and put away <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from your flesh</em>;... <em>and remember your Creator</em>... <em>or ever the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days come </em>,.... <em>or ever the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars be darkened</em> ,.... <em>and they that look out of the windows be darkened</em> ; (signifying the faculty of sight;) <em>or ever the silver cord be loosed</em>; (meaning the assemblage of the stars, for their appearance is like silver;) <em>and the flower of gold be broken</em> ; (thus veiling the mention of the golden sun; for the camomile is a well-known plant, having many ray-like leaves shooting out round it;) <em>and they shall rise up at the voice of the sparrow, yea, they shall look away from the height, and terrors shall be in the way</em>.  What shall they see? <em>Then shall they see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming on the clouds of heaven; and they shall mourn tribe by tribe</em>.  And what shall come to pass when the Lord has come? <em>The almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall grow heavy, and the caper-berry shall be scattered abroad</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311910"><a href="../bible/ecc012.htm#verse5">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;12:5</a></span> And as the interpreters say, the blossoming almond signifies the departure of winter; and our bodies shall then after the winter blossom with a heavenly flower.  <em>And the grasshopper shall grow in substance</em> (that means the winged <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> clothing itself with the body ,) <em>and the caper-berry shall be scattered abroad</em> (that is, the transgressors who are like thorns shall be scattered ).</p>

<p>21. You see how they all foretell the coming of the Lord. You see how they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <em>the voice of the sparrow</em>. Let us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what sort of voice this is. <em>For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311914"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:16</a></span> The Archangel shall make proclamation and say to all, <em>Arise to meet the Lord</em>.  And fearful will be that descent of our Master. David says, <em>God shall manifestly come, even our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and shall not keep silence; a fire shall burn before Him, and a fierce tempest round about Him</em>, and the rest.  The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall come to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> which was just now read, <em>on the clouds of heaven</em>, drawn by <em>a stream of fire</em> , which is to make trial of men. Then if any man's works are of gold, he shall be made brighter; if any man's course of life be like stubble, and unsubstantial, it shall be burnt up by the fire.  And the Father <em>shall sit</em>, having <em>His garment white as snow, and the hair of His head like pure wool</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311919"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse9">Daniel&nbsp;7:9</a></span> But this is spoken after the manner of men; wherefore? Because He is the King of those who have not been defiled with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; <em>for</em>, He says, <em>I will make your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> white as snow, and as wool</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311920"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;1:18</a></span>, which is an emblem of forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or of sinlessness itself. But the Lord who shall come from heaven on the clouds, is He who ascended on the clouds; for He Himself has said, <em>And they shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note311921"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;24:30</a></span> .</p>

<p>22. But what is the sign of His coming? Lest a hostile power dare to counterfeit it. <em>And then shall appear</em>, He says, <em>the sign of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> in heaven</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311922"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse30">Ib</a></span> Now Christ's own <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sign is the Cross; a sign of a luminous Cross shall go before the King , plainly declaring Him who was formerly crucified: that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who before <em>pierced Him</em> and plotted against Him, when they see it, may <em>mourn tribe by tribe</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311924"><a href="../bible/zec012.htm#verse12">Zechariah&nbsp;12:12</a></span>, saying, <q>This is He who was buffeted, this is He whose face they spat on, this is He whom they bound with chains, this is He whom of old they crucified, and set at nought.  Whither, they will say, shall we flee from the face of Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>?</q> But the Angel hosts shall encompass them, so that they shall not be able to flee anywhere. The sign of the Cross shall be a terror to His foes; but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to His friends who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him, or preached Him, or suffered for His sake. Who then is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> man, who shall then be found a friend of Christ? That King, so great and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, attended by the Angel-guards, the partner of the Father's throne, will not despise His own servants. For that His Elect may not be confused with His foes, <em>He shall send forth His Angels with a great trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311926"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;24:31</a></span> He despised not <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, who was but one; how then shall He despise many righteous? <em>Come, you blessed of My Father</em> , will He say to them who shall then ride on chariots of clouds, and be assembled by Angels.</p>

<p>23. But some one present will say, <q>I am a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man,</q> or again, <q>I shall perhaps be found at that time sick in bed;</q> or, <q>I am but a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and I shall be taken at the mill: shall we then be despised?</q> Be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, O man; the Judge is no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; <em>He will not judge according to a man's appearance, nor reprove according to his speech</em>.  He honours not the learned before the simple, nor the rich before the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy</a>. Though thou be in the field, the Angels shall take you; think not that He will take the landowners, and leave you the husbandman. Though thou be a slave, though thou be poor, be not any whit distressed; He who <em>took the form of a servant</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311929"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> despises not servants. Though thou be lying sick in bed, yet it is written, <em>Then shall two be in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other left</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311930"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;17:34</a></span> Though thou be of compulsion put to grind, whether thou be man or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> ; though thou be in fetters , and sit beside the mill, yet He <em>who by His might brings out them that are bound</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311933"><a href="../bible/exo011.htm#verse5">Exodus&nbsp;11:5</a></span>, will not overlook you. He who brought forth Joseph out of slavery and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to a kingdom, shall redeem you also from your afflictions into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Only be of good cheer, only work, only strive earnestly; for nothing shall be lost. Every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of yours, every Psalm you sing is recorded; every alms-deed, every fast is recorded; every marriage duly observed is recorded; continence  kept for God's sake is recorded; but the first crowns in the records are those of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and purity; and you shall shine as an Angel. But as you have gladly listened to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, so listen again without shrinking to the contrary. Every <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> deed of yours is recorded; your every act of fornication is recorded, your every false <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is recorded, every <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and sorcery, and theft, and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. All these things are henceforth to be recorded, if you do the same now after having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; for your former <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are blotted out.</p>

<p>24. <em>When the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a></em>, He says, <em>shall come in His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and all the Angels with Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311935"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;25:31</a></span> Behold, O man, before what multitudes you shall come to judgment. Every race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> will then be present. Reckon, therefore, how many are the Roman nation; reckon how many the barbarian tribes now living, and how many have died within the last hundred years; reckon how many nations have been buried during the last thousand years; reckon all from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to this day. Great indeed is the multitude; but yet it is little, for the Angels are many more. They are <em>the ninety and nine sheep</em>, but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> is the single <em>one</em>.  For according to the extent of universal space, must we reckon the number of its inhabitants. The whole earth is but as a point in the midst of the one heaven, and yet contains so great a multitude; what a multitude must the heaven which encircles it contain? And must not the heaven of heavens contain unimaginable numbers ? And it is written, <em>Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311938"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse10">Daniel&nbsp;7:10</a></span>; not that the multitude is only so great, but because the Prophet could not express more than these. So there will be present at the judgment in that day, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father of all, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> being seated with Him, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> present with Them; and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> trumpet shall summon us all to bring our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> with us. Ought we not then from this time forth to be sore troubled? Think it not a slight doom, O man, even apart from punishment, to be condemned in the presence of so many. Shall we not choose rather to die many deaths, than be condemned by friends?</p>

<p>25. Let us dread then, brethren, lest God condemn us; who needs not examination or <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, to condemn. Say not, In the night I committed fornication, or wrought sorcery, or did any other thing, and there was no man by. Out of your own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> shall you be judged, your <em>thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men <span class="stiki" id="note311939"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;2:15-16</a></span> </em>. The terrible countenance of the Judge will force you to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; or rather, even though thou speak not, it will convict you. For you shall rise clothed with your own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or else with your righteous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. And this has the Judge Himself declared&mdash; for it is Christ who judges&mdash; <em>for neither does the Father judge any man, but he has given all judgment unto the Son</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311940"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;5:22</a></span>, not divesting Himself of His power, but judging through the Son; the Son therefore judges by the will  of the Father; for the wills of the Father and of the Son are not different, but one and the same. What then says the Judge, as to whether you shall bear your works, or no? <em>And before Him shall they gather all nations</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311942"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;25:32</a></span>: (for in the presence of Christ <em>every knee must bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311943"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse10">Philippians&nbsp;2:10</a></span>:) <em>and He shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd divides his sheep from the goats</em>. How does the shepherd make the separation? Does he examine out of a book which is a sheep and which a goat? Or does he distinguish by their evident marks? Does not the wool show the sheep, and the hairy and rough skin the goat? In like manner, if you have been just now cleansed from your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> shall be henceforth as pure wool; and your robe shall remain unstained, and you shall ever say, <em>I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on</em> ? By your vesture shall you be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> for a sheep. But if you be found hairy, like <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, who was rough with hair, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, who for food lost his birthright and sold his privilege, you shall be one of those on the left hand. But God forbid that any here present should be cast out from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> be found among the ranks of the sinners on the left hand!</p>

<p>26. Terrible in good <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the judgment, and terrible the things announced. The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is set before us, and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a> is prepared. How then, some one will say, are we to escape the fire? And how to enter into the kingdom? <em>I was an hungered</em>, He says, <em>and you gave Me meat</em>. Learn hence the way; there is here no need of allegory, but to fulfil what is said. <em>I was an hungered, and you gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and you took Me in; naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and you came unto Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311945"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;25:35</a></span> These things if you do, you shall reign together with Him; but if you do them not, you shall be condemned. At once then begin to do these works, and abide in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; lest, like the foolish <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, tarrying to buy oil, thou be shut out. Be not confident because thou merely possessest the lamp, but constantly keep it burning. Let the light of your good works shine before men <span class="stiki" id="note311946"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;5:16</a></span>, and let not Christ be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> on your account. Wear thou a garment of incorruption , resplendent in good works; and whatever matter you receive from God to administer as a steward, administer profitably. Have you been put in trust with riches? Dispense them well. Have you been entrusted with the word of teaching? Be a good steward thereof. Can you attach the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the hearers ? Do this diligently. There are many doors of good stewardship. Only let none of us be condemned and cast out; that we may with boldness meet Christ the Everlasting King, who reigns for ever. For He does reign for ever, who shall be judge of quick and dead, because for quick and dead He died. And as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <em>For to this end Christ both died and lived again, that He might be Lord both of the dead and living</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311949"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;14:9</a></span> .</p>

<p>27. And should you ever hear any say that the kingdom of Christ shall have an end, abhor the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; it is another head of the dragon, lately sprung up in . A certain one has dared to affirm, that after the end of the world Christ shall reign no longer ; he has also dared to say, that the Word having come forth from the Father shall be again absorbed into the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and shall be no more ; uttering such <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> to his own perdition. For he has not listened to the Lord, saying, The Son abides for ever. <span class="stiki" id="note311952"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;8:25</a></span> He has not listened to Gabriel, saying, And He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end. <span class="stiki" id="note311953"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;1:33</a></span> Consider this text. Heretics of this day teach in disparagement of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while Gabriel the Archangel taught the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> abiding of the Saviour; whom then will you rather <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? Will you not rather give credence to Gabriel? Listen to the testimony of Daniel in the text ; I saw in a vision of the night, and behold, one like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days.....And to Him was given the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and the dominion, and the kingdom: and all peoples, tribes, and languages shall serve Him; His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed. <span class="stiki" id="note311955"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse13">Daniel&nbsp;7:13-14</a></span> These things rather hold fast, these things <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and cast away from you the words of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; for you have heard most plainly of the endless kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>28. The like doctrine you have also in the interpretation of the <em>Stone, which was cut out of a mountain without hands</em>, which is <em>Christ according to the flesh</em> ; <em>And His kingdom shall not be left to another people</em>. David also says in one place, <em>Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever</em> ; and in another place, <em>You, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundations of the earth, etc., they shall perish, but You remain, etc.; but You are the same, and Your years shall not fail</em> : words which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has interpreted of the Son <span class="stiki" id="note311959"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse10">Hebrews&nbsp;1:10-12</a></span> .</p>

<p>29. And would you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how they who teach the contrary ran into such <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>? They read wrongly that good word of the Apostle, <em>For He must reign, till He has put all enemies under His feet</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311960"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:25</a></span>; and they say, when His enemies shall have been put under His feet, He shall cease to reign, wrongly and foolishly alleging this. For He who is king before He has subdued His enemies, how shall He not the rather be king, after He has gotten the mastery over them.</p>

<p>30. They have also dared to say that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <em>When all things shall be subjected unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subjected unto Him that subjected all things unto Him</em> &mdash;that this Scripture shows that the Son also shall be absorbed into the Father. Shall you then, O most impious of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, you the creatures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, continue? And shall Christ perish, by whom both you and all things were made? Such a word is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>. But further, how shall all things be made subject unto Him? By perishing, or by abiding? Shall then the other things, when subject to the Son abide, and shall the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, when subject to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not abide? For He shall be subjected, not because He shall then begin to do the Father's will (for from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> He <em>does</em> always <em>those things that please Him <span class="stiki" id="note311962"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;8:29</a></span> </em>), but because, then as before, He obeys the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, yielding, not a forced <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, but a self-chosen accordance; for He is not a servant, that He should be subjected by force, but a Son, that He should comply of His free choice and natural <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>31. But let us examine them; what is the meaning of <q>until</q> or <q>as long as?</q> For with the very phrase will I close with them, and try to overthrow their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Since they have dared to say that the words, <em>till He has put His enemies under His feet</em>, show that He Himself shall have an end, and have presumed to set bounds to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to bring to an end, as far as words go, His never-ending sovereignty, come then, let us read the like expressions in the Apostle: <em>Nevertheless, death reigned from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> till <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a></em>.  Did men then die up to that time, and did none die any more after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, or after the Law has there been no more death among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? Well then, you see that the word <q>unto</q> is not to limit time; but that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> rather signified this&mdash;<q>And yet, though <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was a righteous and wonderful man, nevertheless the doom of death, which was uttered against Adam, reached even unto him, and them that came after him; and this, though they had not committed the like <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as Adam, by his disobedience in eating of the tree.</q></p>

<p>32. Take again another similar text. <em>For until this day...when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is read, a veil lies upon their heart <span class="stiki" id="note311964"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:14-15</a></span> </em>. Does <em>until this day</em> mean only <q>until <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?</q> Is it not <em>until this day</em> present, and even to the end? And if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> say to the Corinthians, <em>For we came even as far as unto you in preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, having hope when your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> increases to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in the regions beyond you</em> , you see manifestly that <em>as far as</em> implies not the end, but has something following it. In what <em>sense then should you remember that Scripture, till</em> He has put all enemies under His feet <span class="stiki" id="note311966"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:25</a></span>? According as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says in another place, <em>And exhort each other daily, while it is called today</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311967"><a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse13">Hebrews&nbsp;3:13</a></span>; meaning, <q>continually.</q> For as we may not speak of the <q>beginning of the days</q> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so neither suffer thou that any should ever speak of the end of His kingdom. For it is written, <em>His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom</em>. </p>

<p>33. And though I have many more testimonies out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, concerning the kingdom of Christ which has no end for ever, I will be content at present with those above mentioned, because the day is far spent. But you, O hearer, worship only Him as your King, and flee all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. And if the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God permit us, the remaining Articles also of the Faith shall be in good time declared to you. And may the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the whole world keep you all in safety, bearing in mind the signs of the end, and remaining unsubdued by <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. You have received the tokens of the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Deceiver</a> who is to come; you have received the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ, who shall openly come down from heaven. Flee therefore the one, the False one; and look for the other, the True. You have learned the way, how in the judgment you may be found among those on the right hand; guard <em>that which is committed to you</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311969"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:20</a></span> concerning Christ, and be conspicuous in good works, that you may stand with a good confidence before the Judge, and inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>:&mdash; Through whom, and with whom, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to God with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
