<p><strong>On the Article, And in One Holy Ghost, the Comforter, Which Spoke in the Prophets.</strong></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->1 Corinthians 12:1, 4</p>

<p>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>....Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit, etc.</p>

<p>1. Spiritual in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we need, in order to discourse concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; not that we may speak what is worthy of Him, for this is impossible, but that by speaking the words of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, we may run our course without danger. For a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> fearful thing is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, where Christ has plainly said, <em>Whosoever shall speak a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311970"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;12:32</a></span> And there is often <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, lest a man should receive this condemnation, through speaking what he ought not concerning Him, either from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or from supposed reverence. The Judge of quick and dead, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, declared that he has no forgiveness; if therefore any man offend, what hope has he?</p>

<p>2. It must therefore belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself to grant both to us to speak without deficiency, and to you to hear with discretion; for discretion is needful not to them only who speak, but also to them that hear, lest they hear one thing, and misconceive another in their mind. Let us then speak concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> nothing but what is written; and whatsoever is not written, let us not busy ourselves about it. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself spoke the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; He has also spoken concerning Himself as much as He pleased, or as much as we could receive. Let us therefore speak those things which He has said; for whatsoever He has not said, we dare not say.</p>

<p>3. There is One Only <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Comforter; and as there is One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and no second Father;&mdash; and as there is One Only-begotten Son and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who has no brother&mdash;so is there One Only <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and no second spirit equal in-<a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to Him. Now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is a Power most mighty, a Being divine and unsearchable; for He is living and intelligent, a sanctifying principle of all things made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through Christ. He it is who illuminates the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just; He was in the Prophets, He was also in the Apostles in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Abhorred be they who dare to separate the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>! There is One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Lord of the Old and of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>: and One Lord, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who was prophesied of in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and came in the New; and One <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who through the Prophets preached of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and when Christ had come, descended, and manifested Him. </p>

<p>4. Let no one therefore separate the Old from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> ; let no one say that the Spirit in the former is one, and in the latter another; since thus he offends against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself, who with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> together is honoured, and at the time of Holy Baptism is included with them in the Holy Trinity. For the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> said plainly to the Apostles, <em>Go and make <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them into the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em>.  Our hope is in Father, and Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. We preach not three Gods ; let the Marcionites be silenced; but with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> through One Son, we preach One God. The Faith is indivisible; the worship inseparable. We neither separate the Holy Trinity, like some; nor do we as Sabellius work confusion.  But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> according to godliness One Father, who sent His Son to be our Saviour; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> One Son, who promised that He would send the Comforter from the Father; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who spoke in the Prophets, and who on the day of Pentecost descended on the Apostles in the form of fiery tongues, here, in Jerusalem, in the Upper Church of the Apostles ; for in all things the choicest privileges are with us. Here Christ came down from heaven; here the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came down from heaven. And in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it were most fitting, that as we discourse concerning Christ and Golgotha here in Golgotha, so also we should speak concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the Upper Church; yet since He who descended there jointly partakes of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him who was crucified here, we here speak concerning Him also who descended there: for their worship is indivisible.</p>

<p>5. We would now say somewhat concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; not to declare His substance with exactness, for this were impossible; but to speak of the diverse mistakes of some concerning him, lest from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> we should fall into them; and to block up the paths of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, that we may journey on the King's one highway. And if we now for caution's sake repeat any statement of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, let it recoil on their heads, and may we be guiltless, both we who speak, and you who hear.</p>

<p>6. For the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who are most profane in all things, have <em>sharpened their tongue</em>  against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> also, and have dared to utter impious things; as <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> the interpreter has written in his injunctions against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.  For some of them have dared to say that they were themselves the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>&mdash;of whom the first was Simon , the sorcerer spoken of in the Acts of the Apostles; for when he was cast out, he presumed to teach such doctrines: and they who are called <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, impious men, have spoken other things against the Spirit , and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>  again something else; and the profane Manes dared to call himself the Paraclete sent by Christ.  Others again have taught that the Spirit is different in the Prophets and in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.  Yea, and great is their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, or rather their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. Such therefore abhor, and flee from them who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and have no forgiveness. For what fellowship have you with the desperate, you, who art now to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, into the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> also ? If he who attaches himself to a thief, and consents with him, is subject to punishment, what hope shall he have, who offends against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>?</p>

<p>7. Let the <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionists</a> also be abhorred, who tear away from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the sayings of the Old.  For <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> first, that most impious of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who first asserted three Gods , <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are contained testimonies of the Prophets concerning Christ, cut out the testimonies taken from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, that the King might be left without <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. Abhor those above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, men of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by name, but fraught with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; who have dared to say such things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as I dare not repeat.</p>

<p>8. Let the Cataphrygians  also be your abhorrence, and <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, their ringleader in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and his two so-called prophetesses, Maximilla and Priscilla. For this <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, who was out of his mind and really mad (for he would not have said such things, had he not been mad), dared to say that he was himself the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>&mdash;he, miserable man, and filled with all uncleanness and lasciviousness; for it suffices but to hint at this, out of respect for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who are present. And having taken possession of Pepuza, a very small hamlet of Phrygia, he <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> named it Jerusalem; and cutting the throats of wretched little children, and chopping them up into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> food, for the purpose of their so-called <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> &mdash;(wherefore till but lately in the time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> we were suspected of doing this, because these <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> were called, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> indeed, by the common name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>;)&mdash; yet he dared to call himself the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, filled as he was with all impiety and inhuman cruelty, and condemned by an irrevocable sentence.</p>

<p>9. And he was seconded, as was said before, by that most impious Manes also, who combined what was bad in every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> ; who being the very lowest pit of destruction, collected the doctrines of all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and wrought out and taught a yet more novel <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and dared to say that he himself was the Comforter, whom Christ promised to send. But the Saviour when He promised Him, said to the Apostles, <em>But tarry in the city of Jerusalem, until you are endued with power from on high</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311990"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;24:49</a></span> What then? Did the Apostles who had been dead two hundred years, wait for Manes, <em>until they should be endued with the power</em>; and will any dare to say, that they were not immediately full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? Moreover it is written, <em>Then they laid their hands on and they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note311991"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse17">Acts&nbsp;8:17</a></span>; was not this before Manes, yea, many years before, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended on the day of Pentecost?</p>

<p>10. Wherefore was Simon the sorcerer condemned? Was it not that he came to the Apostles, and said, <em>Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em>? For he said not, <q>Give me also the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> but <q>Give me the power;</q> that he might sell to others that which could not be sold, and which he did not himself possess. He offered money also to them who had no possessions ; and this, though he saw men bringing the prices of the things sold, and laying them at the Apostles' feet. And he considered not that they who trod under foot the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which was brought for the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, were not likely to give the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> for a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a>. But what say they to Simon? <em>Your money perish with you, because you have thought to purchase the gift of God with money</em> ; for you are a second Judas, for expecting to buy the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit with money. If then Simon, for wishing to get this power for a price, is to <em>perish</em>, how great is the impiety of Manes, who said that he was the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? Let us <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them who are worthy of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; let us turn away from them from whom God turns away; let us also ourselves say unto God with all boldness concerning all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <em>Do not I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them, O Lord, that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> You, and am not I grieved with Your enemies</em> ? For there is also an enmity which is right, according as it is written, <em>I will put enmity between you and her seed</em> <span class="stiki" id="note311995"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse15">Genesis&nbsp;3:15</a></span>; for friendship with the serpent works enmity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and death.</p>

<p>11. Let then thus much suffice concerning those outcasts; and now let us return to the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, and let us <em>drink waters out of our own cisterns</em> [that is, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers ], <em>and out of our own springing wells</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note311997"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse15">Proverbs&nbsp;5:15</a></span> Drink we of <em>living water, springing up into everlasting life</em> ; <em>but this spoke</em> the Saviour <em>of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which they that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him should receive</em>.  For observe what He says, <em>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Me</em> (not simply this, but), <em>as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has said</em> (thus He has sent you back to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>), <em>out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water</em>, not rivers perceived by sense, and merely watering the earth with its thorns and trees, but bringing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to the light. And in another place He says, <em>But the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of living water springing up</em>  <em>into everlasting life</em>,&mdash; a new kind of water living and springing up, springing up unto them who are worthy.</p>

<p>12. And why did He call the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit water? Because by water all things subsist; because water brings forth grass and living things; because the water of the showers comes down from heaven; because it comes down one in form, but works in many forms. For one fountain waters the whole of Paradise, and one and the same rain comes down upon all the world, yet it becomes white in the lily, and red in the rose, and purple in violets and hyacinths, and different and varied in each several kind: so it is one in the palm-tree, and another in the vine, and all in all things; and yet is one in nature, not diverse from itself; for the rain does not change itself, and come down first as one thing, then as another, but adapting itself to the constitution of each thing which receives it, it becomes to each what is suitable.  Thus also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, being one, and of one nature, and indivisible, divides to each His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, <em>according as He will</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312001"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:11</a></span>: and as the dry tree, after partaking of water, puts forth shoots, so also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when it has been through repentance made worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, brings forth clusters of righteousness. And though He is One in nature, yet many are the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and in the Name of Christ He works. For He employs the tongue of one man for wisdom; the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of another He enlightens by Prophecy; to another He gives power to drive away devils; to another He gives to interpret the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>. He strengthens one man's self-command; He teaches another the way to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; another He teaches to fast and discipline himself; another He teaches to despise the things of the body; another He trains for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>: diverse in different men, yet not diverse from Himself, as it is written, <em>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> according to the same Spirit; to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healing, in the same Spirit; and to another workings of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; and to another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; and to another discernings of spirits; and to another various kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these works that one and the same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will</em>. </p>

<p>13. But since concerning spirit in general many diverse things are written in the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, and there is <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest some out of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> fall into confusion, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> to what sort of spirit the writing refers; it will be well now to certify you, of what kind the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> declares the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be. For as <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> is called Christ, and David and Saul and others are called Christs , but there is only one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ, so likewise since the name of spirit is given to different things, it is right to see what is that which is distinctively called the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For many things are called spirits. Thus an Angel is called spirit, our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is called spirit, and this wind which is blowing is called spirit; great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> also is spoken of as spirit; and impure practice is called spirit; and a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> our adversary is called spirit. Beware therefore when you hear these things, lest from their having a common name thou mistake one for another. For concerning our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <em>His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return to his earth</em> : and of the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> it says again, <em>Which forms the spirit of man within him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312005"><a href="../bible/zec012.htm#verse1">Zechariah&nbsp;12:1</a></span> And of the Angels it is said in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <em>Who makes His Angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire</em>.  And of the wind it says, <em>You shall break the ships of Tarshish with a violent spirit</em> ; and, <em>As the tree in the wood is shaken by the spirit</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312008"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;7:2</a></span>; and, <em>Fire, hail, snow, ice, spirit of storm</em>.  And of good doctrine the Lord Himself says, <em>The words that I have spoken unto you, they are spirit</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312010"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse63">John&nbsp;6:63</a></span>, <em>and they are life</em>; instead of, <q>are spiritual.</q> But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not pronounced by the tongue; but He is a Living Spirit, who gives wisdom of speech, Himself speaking and discoursing.</p>

<p>14. And would you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He discourses and speaks? Philip by revelation of an Angel went down to the way which leads to Gaza, when the Eunuch was coming; and the Spirit said to Philip, <em>Go near, and join yourself to this chariot</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312011"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse29">Acts&nbsp;8:29</a></span> Do you see the Spirit talking to one who hears Him? Ezekiel also speaks thus, <em>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> came upon me, and said unto me, Thus says the Lord</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312012"><a href="../bible/eze011.htm#verse5">Ezekiel&nbsp;11:5</a></span> And again, <em>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> said <span class="stiki" id="note312013"><a href="../bible/act013.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;13:2</a></span> </em>, unto the Apostles who were in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <em>Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them</em>. Beholdest thou the Spirit living, separating, calling, and with authority sending forth? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also said, <em>Save that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me</em>.  For this good Sanctifier of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and her Helper, and Teacher, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Comforter, of whom the Saviour said, <em>He shall</em>  <em>teach you all things</em> (and He said not only, <em>He shall teach</em>, but also, <em>He shall bring to your remembrance whatever I have said unto you</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312015"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;14:26</a></span>; for the teachings of Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are not different, but the same)&mdash; He, I say, testified before to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> what things should befall him, that he might be the more stout-hearted, from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> them beforehand. Now I have spoken these things unto you because of the text, <em>The words which I have spoken unto you, they are spirit</em>; that you may understand this, not of the utterance of the lips , but of the good doctrine in this passage.</p>

<p>15. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also is called spirit, as I have already said; only in another and opposite sense, as when it is said, <em>The spirit of whoredom caused them to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312017"><a href="../bible/hos004.htm#verse12">Hosea&nbsp;4:12</a></span> The name <q>spirit</q> is given also to the <em>unclean spirit</em>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; but with the addition of, <q>the unclean;</q> for to each is joined its distinguishing name, to mark its proper nature. If the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> speak of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it says <em>the spirit</em> with the addition, <em>of the man</em>; if it mean the wind, it says, <em>spirit of storm</em>; if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it says, <em>spirit of whoredom</em>; if the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, it says, <em>an unclean spirit</em>: that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> which particular thing is spoken of, and you may not suppose that it means the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; God forbid! For this name of spirit is common to many things; and every thing which has not a solid body is in a general way called spirit.  Since, therefore, the devils have not such bodies, they are called spirits: but there is a great difference; for the unclean <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, when he comes upon a man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (may the Lord deliver from him every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of those who hear me, and of those who are not present), he comes like a wolf upon a sheep, ravening for blood, and ready to devour. His coming is most fierce; the sense of it most oppressive; the mind becomes darkened; his attack is an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> also, and so is his usurpation of another's possession. For he makes forcible use of another's body, and another's instruments, as if they were his own; he throws down him who stands upright (for he is akin to him who <em>fell from heaven</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312019"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;10:18</a></span>); he twists the tongue and distorts the lips; foam comes instead of words; the man is filled with darkness; his eye is open, yet the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees not through it; and the miserable man gasps convulsively at the point of death. The devils are verily foes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, using them foully and mercilessly.</p>

<p>16. Such is not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; God forbid! For His doings tend the contrary way, towards what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and salutary. First, His coming is gentle; the perception of Him is fragrant; His burden most light; beams of light and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> gleam forth before His coming.  He comes with the bowels of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> guardian: for He comes to save, and to heal, to teach, to admonish, to strengthen, to exhort, to enlighten the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, first of him who receives Him, and afterwards of others also, through him. And as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who being previously in darkness then suddenly beholds the sun, is enlightened in his bodily sight, and sees plainly things which he saw not, so likewise he to whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is vouchsafed, is enlightened in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and sees things beyond man's sight, which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not; his body is on earth, yet his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> mirrors forth the heavens. He sees, like Esaias, <em>the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312021"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;6:1</a></span>; he sees, like Ezekiel, <em>Him who is above the Cherubim</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312022"><a href="../bible/eze010.htm#verse1">Ezekiel&nbsp;10:1</a></span>; he sees like Daniel, <em>ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312023"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse10">Daniel&nbsp;7:10</a></span>; and the man, who is so little, beholds the beginning of the world, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the end of the world, and the times intervening, and the successions of kings&mdash;things which he never learned: for the True Enlightener is present with him. The man is within the walls of a house; yet the power of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> reaches far and wide, and he sees even what other men are doing.</p>

<p>17. Peter was not with Ananias and Sapphira when they sold their possessions, but he was present by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; <em>Why</em>, he says, <em>has <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> filled your heart to lie to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312024"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;5:3</a></span>? There was no accuser; there was no <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; whence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> he what had happened? <em>Whiles it remained was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own power? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart</em> ? The <em>unlettered </em> Peter, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, learned what not even the wise men of the Greeks had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. You have the like in the case also of Elisseus. For when he had freely healed the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> of Naaman, Gehazi received the reward, the reward of another's achievement; and he took the money from Naaman, and bestowed it in a dark place. But the <em>darkness is not</em> hidden from the Saints.  And when he came, Elisseus asked him; and like Peter, when he said, <em>Tell me whether you</em>  <em>sold the land for so much</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312028"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;5:8</a></span>? He also enquires, <em>Whence do you come, Gehazi</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312029"><a href="../bible/2ki005.htm#verse25">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;5:25</a></span>? Not in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but in sorrow ask I <em>whence do you come</em>? From darkness are you come, and to darkness shall you go; you have sold the cure of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> is your heritage. I, he says, have fulfilled the bidding of Him who said to me, <em>Freely you have received, freely give</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312030"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;10:8</a></span>; but you have sold this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; receive now the condition of the sale. But what says Elisseus to him? <em>Went not mine heart with you</em>? I was here shut in by the body, but the spirit which has been given me of God saw even the things afar off, and showed me plainly what was doing elsewhere. Do you see how the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> not only rids of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but invests with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? Do you see how He enlightens men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>?</p>

<p>18. Esaias lived nearly a thousand years ago; and he beheld Zion <em>as a booth</em>. The city was still standing, and beautified with public places, and robed in majesty; yet he says, <em>Zion shall be ploughed as a field</em> , foretelling what is now fulfilled in our days.  And observe the exactness of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; for he said, <em>And the daughter of Zion shall be left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers</em>.  And now the place is filled with gardens of cucumbers. Do you see how the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> enlightens the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>? Be not therefore carried away to other things, by the force of a common term, but keep fast the exact meaning.</p>

<p>19. And if ever, while you have been sitting here, a thought concerning <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> or <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> has come into your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it has been His teaching. Has not often a maiden, already at the bridal threshold , fled away, He teaching her the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>? Has not often a man distinguished at court , scorned <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and rank, under the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? Has not often a young man, at the sight of beauty, closed his eyes, and fled from the sight, and escaped the defilement? Askest thou whence this has come to pass? The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> taught the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the young man. Many ways of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> are there in the world; yet <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> refuse possessions: wherefore? Because of the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that Spirit, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and good; and fittingly are we <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. A man, still clothed with a body, wrestles with many fiercest <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and often the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, whom many men could not master with iron bands, has been mastered by the man himself with words of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, through the power which is in him of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and the mere breathing of the Exorcist  becomes as fire to that unseen foe. A mighty ally and protector, therefore, have we from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; a great Teacher of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a mighty Champion on our behalf. Let us not be afraid of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, nor of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; for mightier is He who fights for us. Only let us open to Him our doors; <em>for He goes about seeking such as are worthy</em>  and searching on whom He may confer His gifts.</p>

<p>20. And He is called the Comforter, because He comforts and encourages us, and <em>helps our infirmities; for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought; but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312038"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;8:26</a></span>, that is, makes intercession to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Oftentimes a man for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake has been outraged and dishonoured <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is at hand; tortures on every side, and fire, and sword, and savage beasts, and the pit. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> softly whispers to him, <q> <em>Wait on the Lord</em> , O man; what is now befalling you is a small matter, the reward will be great. Suffer a little while, and you shall be with Angels for ever. <em>The sufferings of this present time art not worthy to be compared with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which shall be revealed in us</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312040"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;8:18</a></span> .</q> He portrays to the man the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; He gives him a glimpse of the paradise of delight; and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, whose bodily countenances are of necessity turned to their judges, but who in spirit are already in Paradise, despise those hardships which are seen.</p>

<p>21. And would you be sure that by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> the Martyrs bear their <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>? The Saviour says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <em>And when they bring you unto</em>  <em>the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, and the magistrates, and authorities, be not anxious how you shall answer, or what you shall say; for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall teach you in that very hour, what you ought to say</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312041"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;12:11-12</a></span> For it is impossible to testify as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, except a man testify by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; for if <em>no man can say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the Lord, but by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em> , how shall any man give his own life for Jesus' sake, but by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>?</p>

<p>22. Great indeed, and all-powerful in gifts, and wonderful, is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Consider, how many of you are now sitting here, how many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of us are present. He is working suitably for each, and being present in the midst, beholds the temper of each, beholds also his reasoning and his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and what we say, and think, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.  Great indeed is what I have now said, and yet is it small. For consider, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, with mind enlightened by Him, how many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> there are in all this diocese, and how many in the whole province  of Palestine, and carry forward your mind from this province, to the whole Roman Empire; and after this, consider the whole world; races of Persians, and nations of Indians, Garbs and Sarmatians, Gauls and Spaniards, and Moors, Libyans and <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>, and the rest for whom we have no names; for of many of the nations not even the names have reached us. Consider, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, of each nation, Bishops, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a>, Deacons, Solitaries, Virgins, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> besides; and then behold their great Protector, and the Dispenser of their gifts;&mdash; how throughout the world He gives to one <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, to another perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, to another almsgiving, to another <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> poverty, to another power of repelling hostile spirits. And as the light, with one touch of its radiance sheds brightness on all things, so also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> enlightens those who have eyes; for if any from blindness is not vouchsafed His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, let him not blame the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but his own unbelief.</p>

<p>23. You have seen His power, which is in all the world; tarry now no longer upon earth, but ascend on high. Ascend, I say, in imagination even unto the first heaven, and behold there so many countless myriads of Angels. Mount up in your thoughts, if you can, yet higher; consider, I pray you, the Archangels, consider also the Spirits; consider the Virtues, consider the Principalities, consider the Powers, consider the Thrones, consider the Dominions &mdash;of all these the Comforter is the Ruler from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Teacher, and the Sanctifier. Of Him Elias has need, and Elisseus, and Esaias, among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; of Him Michael and Gabriel have need among Angels. Naught of things created is equal in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to Him: for the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the Angels, and all their hosts assembled together, have no equality with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. All these the all-excellent power of the Comforter overshadows. And they indeed are sent forth to minister <span class="stiki" id="note312046"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;1:14</a></span>, but He searches even the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according as the Apostle says, For the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For what man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the thing of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, save the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the things of God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no man, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> <span class="stiki" id="note312047"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:10-11</a></span> .</p>

<p>24. He preached concerning Christ in the Prophets; He wrought in the Apostles; He to this day seals the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in Baptism. And the Father indeed gives to the Son; and the Son shares with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For it is Jesus Himself, not I, who says, <em>All things are delivered unto Me of My Father</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312048"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span>; and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> He says, <em>When He, the Spirit of Truth, shall come</em>, and the rest.... <em>He shall glorify Me; for He shall receive of Mine, and shall show it unto you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312049"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;16:13-14</a></span> The Father through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is the giver of all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; the gifts of the Father are none other than those of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and those of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; for there is one Salvation, one Power, one Faith; One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father; One Lord, His only-begotten Son; One <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Comforter. And it is enough for us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things; but inquire not curiously into His nature or substance : for had it been written, we would have spoken of it; what is not written, let us not venture on; it is sufficient for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that there is Father, and Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>25. This Spirit descended upon the seventy Elders in the days of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. (Now let not the length of the discourse, beloved, produce weariness in you: but may He the very subject of our discourse grant strength to every one, both to us who speak, and to you who listen!) This Spirit, as I was saying, came down upon the seventy Elders in the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; and this I say to you, that I may now prove, that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, and works <em>as He will</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312051"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:11</a></span> The seventy Elders were chosen; <em>And the Lord came down in a cloud, and took of the Spirit that was upon <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and put it upon the seventy Elders</em> ; not that the Spirit was divided, but that His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was distributed in proportion to the vessels, and the capacity of the recipients. Now there were present sixty and eight, and they prophesied; but Eldad and Modad were not present: therefore that it might be shown that it was not <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who bestowed the gift, but the Spirit who wrought, Eldad and Modad, who though called, had not as yet presented themselves, did also prophesy. </p>

<p>26. Jesus the Son of Nun, the successor of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, was amazed; and came to him and said, <q>Have you heard that Eldad and Modad are prophesying? They were called, and they came not; <em>my lord <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, forbid them</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312054"><a href="../bible/num011.htm#verse28">Numbers&nbsp;11:28</a></span> .</q> <q>I cannot forbid them,</q> he says, <q>for this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>; nay, so far am I from forbidding them, that I myself am thankful for it. I think not, however, that you have said this in <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; <em>art</em> thou <em>jealous for my sake</em>, because that they prophesy, and you prophesy not yet? Wait for the proper season; <em>and oh that all the Lord's people may be <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, whenever the Lord shall give His Spirit upon them</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312055"><a href="../bible/num011.htm#verse29">Numbers&nbsp;11:29</a></span>!</q> saying this also <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>, <em>whenever the Lord shall give</em>; <q>For as yet then He has not given it; so you have it not yet.</q>&mdash; Had not then <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> this, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph? And they of old, had they it not? Nay, but the words, <q> <em>whenever the Lord shall give</em></q> evidently mean <q>give it upon all; as yet indeed the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is partial, then it shall be given lavishly.</q> And he secretly alluded to what was to happen among us on the day of Pentecost; for He Himself came down among us. He had however also come down upon many before. For it is written, <em>And Jesus the son of Nun was filled with a spirit of wisdom; for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had laid his hands upon him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312056"><a href="../bible/deu034.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy&nbsp;34:9</a></span> You see the figure everywhere the same in the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>&mdash;in the days of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the Spirit was given by <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>; and by <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> Peter  also gives the Spirit. And on you also, who art about to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, shall His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> come; yet in what manner I say not, for I will not anticipate the proper season.</p>

<p>27. He also came down upon all righteous men and Prophets; Enos, I mean, and <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and the rest; upon <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob; for as regards Joseph, even <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> perceived that he had <em>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> within him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312058"><a href="../bible/gen041.htm#verse38">Genesis&nbsp;41:38</a></span> As to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> wrought by the Spirit in his days, you have heard often: This Spirit Job also had, that most enduring man, and all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, though we repeat not all their names. He also was sent forth when the Tabernacle was in making, and filled with wisdom the wise-hearted men who were with Bezaleel. </p>

<p>28. In the might of this Spirit, as we have it in the Book of Judges, Othniel judged <span class="stiki" id="note312060"><a href="../bible/jdg003.htm#verse10">Judges&nbsp;3:10</a></span>; Gideon  waxed strong; Jephtha conquered ; Deborah, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, waged <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; and Samson, so long as he did righteously, and grieved Him not, wrought <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> above man's power. And as for Samuel and David, we have it plainly in the Books of the Kingdoms, how by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> they prophesied themselves, and were rulers of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash;and Samuel was called <em>the Seer</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312063"><a href="../bible/1sa009.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;9:9</a></span>; and David says distinctly, <em>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> spoke by me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312064"><a href="../bible/2sa023.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;23:2</a></span>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <em>And take not your <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from me</em> , and again, <em>Your good Spirit shall lead me in the land of righteousness</em>.  And as we have it in Chronicles, Azariah <span class="stiki" id="note312067"><a href="../bible/2ch015.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;15:1</a></span>, in the time of King Asa, and Jahaziel  in the time of King <a href="../cathen/08502c.htm">Jehoshaphat</a>, partook of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and again, another Azariah, he who was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>.  And Ezra says, <em>You gave also Your good Spirit to instruct them</em>.  But as touching Elias who was taken up, and Elisseus, those inspired  and wonder-working men, it is manifest, without our saying so, that they were full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>29. And if further a man peruse all the books of the Prophets, both of the Twelve, and of the others, he will find many testimonies concerning. the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; as when Micah says in the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>surely I will perfect power by the Spirit the Lord</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312072"><a href="../bible/mic003.htm#verse8">Micah&nbsp;3:8</a></span>; and Joel cries, <em>And it shall come to pass afterwards</em>, says <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>that I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312073"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel&nbsp;2:28</a></span>, and the rest; and Haggai, <em>Because I am with you, says the Lord of Hosts</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312074"><a href="../bible/hag002.htm#verse4">Haggai&nbsp;2:4</a></span>; and <em>My Spirit remains in the midst of you</em> ; and in like manner Zechariah, <em>But receive My words and My statutes which I command by My Spirit, to My servants the Prophets</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312076"><a href="../bible/zec001.htm#verse6">Zechariah&nbsp;1:6</a></span>; and other passages.</p>

<p>30. Esaias too, with his majestic voice, says, <em>And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> shall rest upon Him</em>,  <em>the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and godliness; and the Spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God shall fill Him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312077"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;11:2</a></span>; signifying that the Spirit is one and undivided, but His operations various. So again, <em>Jacob My servant</em>,..... <em>I have put My Spirit upon Him</em>.  And again, <em>I will pour My Spirit upon your seed</em> ; and again, <em>And now the Lord Almighty and His Spirit has sent Me</em> ; and again, <em>This is My covenant with them, says the Lord, My Spirit which is upon you</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312081"><a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse21">Isaiah&nbsp;59:21</a></span>; and again, <em>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon Me, because He has anointed Me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312082"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;61:1</a></span>, and the rest; and again in his charge against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <em>But they rebelled and vexed His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a></em> , and <em>Where is He that put His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> within them</em> ? Also you have in Ezekiel (if you be not now weary of listening), what has already been quoted, <em>And the Spirit fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus says the Lord</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312085"><a href="../bible/eze011.htm#verse5">Ezekiel&nbsp;11:5</a></span> But the words, <em>fell upon me</em> we must understand in a good sense, that is <q>lovingly;</q> and as Jacob, when he had found Joseph, fell upon his neck; as also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, the loving father, on seeing his son who had returned from his wandering, <em>had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him</em>.  And again in Ezekiel, <em>And he brought me in a vision by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> into Chald&aelig;a, to them of the captivity</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312087"><a href="../bible/eze011.htm#verse24">Ezekiel&nbsp;11:24</a></span> And other texts you heard before, in what was said about Baptism; <em>Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you</em> , and the rest; <em>a new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you</em> ; and then immediately, <em>And I will put My Spirit within you</em>.  And again, <em>The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of the Lord</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312091"><a href="../bible/eze037.htm#verse1">Ezekiel&nbsp;37:1</a></span> .</p>

<p>31. He endued with wisdom the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Daniel, that young as he was he should become a judge of Elders. The chaste Susanna was condemned as a wanton; there was none to plead her <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; for who was to deliver her from the rulers? She was led away to death, she was now in the hands of the executioners. But her Helper was at hand, the Comforter, the Spirit who sanctifies every rational nature. Come hither to me, He says to Daniel; young though thou be, convict old men infected with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of youth; for it is written, <em>God raised up the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> upon a young stripling</em> ; and nevertheless, (to pass on quickly,) by the sentence of Daniel that chaste lady was saved. We bring this forward as a testimony; for this is not the season for expounding. <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was in Daniel; for he says to him, <em>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, of whom I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of God is in you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312093"><a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse9">Daniel&nbsp;4:9</a></span> One thing he said <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>; for that he had the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but he was not the <em>master of the magicians</em>, for he was no magician, but was wise through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And before this also, he interpreted to him the vision of the Image, which he who had seen it himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not; for he says, Tell me the vision, which I who saw it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not.  You see the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; that which they who saw it, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, they who saw it not, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and interpret.</p>

<p>32. And indeed it were easy to collect very many texts out of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and to discourse more largely concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But the time is short; and we must be careful of the proper length of the lecture. Wherefore, being for the present content awhile with passages from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, we will, if it be God's pleasure, proceed in the next Lecture to the remaining texts out of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. And may the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and through the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, count all of you worthy of His spiritual and heavenly gifts:&mdash; To whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
