<h1>Catechetical Lecture 17</h1>

<p><strong>Continuation of the Discourse on the Holy Ghost.</strong></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 12:8</a></p>

<p>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, etc.</p>

<p>1. In the preceding Lecture, according to our ability we set before you, our beloved hearers,  some small portion of the testimonies concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and on the present occasion, we will, if it be God's pleasure, proceed to treat, as far as may be, of those which remain out of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>: and as then to keep within due limit of your attention we restrained our eagerness (for there is no satiety in discoursing concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>), so now again we must say but a small part of what remains. For now, as well as then, we candidly own that our weakness is overwhelmed by the multitude of things written. Neither today will we use the subtleties of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for that is unprofitable; but merely call to mind what comes from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>; for this is the safest course, according to the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, who says, <em>Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312096"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> Thus we act like travellers or voyagers, who having one goal to a very long journey, though hastening on with eagerness, yet by reason of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness are wont to touch in their way at various cities or harbours.</p>

<p>2. Therefore though our discourses concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are divided, yet He Himself is undivided, being one and the same. For as in speaking concerning the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, at one time we taught how He is the one only Cause ; and at another, how He is called Father , or Almighty ; and at another, how He is the Creator  of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; and yet the division of the Lectures made no division of the Faith, in that He, the Object of devotion, both was and is One&mdash;and again, as in discoursing concerning the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> we taught at one time concerning His Godhead , and at another concerning His Manhood , dividing into many discourses the doctrines concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, yet preaching undivided <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> towards Him&mdash;so now also though the Lectures concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are divided, yet we preach <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> undivided towards Him. For it is one and the Self-same Spirit who <em>divides</em> His gifts <em>to every man severally as He will</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312103"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:11</a></span>, Himself the while remaining undivided. For the Comforter is not different from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but one and the self-same, called by various names; who lives and subsists, and speaks, and works; and of all rational natures made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through Christ, both of Angels and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, He is the Sanctifier. </p>

<p>3. But lest any from lack of learning, should suppose from the different titles of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> that these are various spirits, and not one and the self-same, which alone there is, therefore the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> guarding you beforehand has delivered to you in the profession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that you <q><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> the Comforter, who spoke by the Prophets;</q> that you might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that though His names be many, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is but one&mdash;of which names, we will now rehearse to you a few out of many.</p>

<p>4. He is called the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> just now read, <em>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312105"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:8</a></span> He is called the Spirit of Truth, as the Saviour says, <em>When He, the Spirit of Truth, has come</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312106"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;16:13</a></span> He is called also the Comforter, as He said, <em>For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you</em>.  But that He is one and the same, though called by different titles, is shown plainly from the following. For that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and the Comforter are the same, is declared in those words, <em>But the Comforter, which is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312108"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;14:26</a></span>; and that the Comforter is the same as the Spirit of Truth, is declared, when it is said, <em>And I will give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth</em> ; and again, <em>But when the Comforter has come whom I will send unto you from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even the Spirit of Truth</em>.  And He is called the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, according as it is written, <em>And I saw the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> descending</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312111"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse32">John&nbsp;1:32</a></span>; and again, <em>For as many as are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, they are the sons of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312112"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;8:14</a></span> He is called also the Spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as the Saviour says, <em>For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312113"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;10:20</a></span>; and again <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <em>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I bow my knees unto the Father</em>, and the rest;... <em>that He would grant you to be strengthened by His Spirit</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312114"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;3:14-16</a></span> He is also called the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>, according to that which Peter spoke, <em>Why is it that you have agreed together to tempt the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312115"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse9">Acts&nbsp;5:9</a></span>? He is called also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writes, <em>But you are not in the flesh, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if so be that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwell in you. But if any man have not the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is none of His</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312116"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;8:9</a></span> He is called also the Spirit of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as it is said, <em>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312117"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;4:6</a></span> He is called also the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as it is written, <em>Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify</em> ; and again, <em>Through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the supply of the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312119"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse19">Philippians&nbsp;1:19</a></span> .</p>

<p>5. You will find many other titles of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> besides. Thus He is called the Spirit of Holiness, as it is written, <em>According to the Spirit of Holiness</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312120"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;1:4</a></span> He is also called the Spirit of adoption, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <em>For you received not the spirit of bondage again unto <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but you received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father</em>.  He is also called the Spirit of revelation, as it is written, <em>May give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312122"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse17">Ephesians&nbsp;1:17</a></span> He is also called the Spirit of promise, as the same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <em>In whom you also after that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, were sealed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of promise</em>.  He is also called the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as when he says again, <em>And has done despite to the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312124"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse29">Hebrews&nbsp;10:29</a></span> And by many other such-like titles is He named. And you heard plainly in the foregoing Lecture, that in the Psalms He is called at one time <em>the good Spirit</em> , and at another the <em>princely Spirit</em> ; and in Esaias He was styled <em>the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel, and might, of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and of godliness, and of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312127"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;11:2</a></span>. By all which Scriptures both those before and those now alleged, it is established, that though the titles of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be different, He is one and the same; living and subsisting, and always present together with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> ; not uttered or breathed from the mouth and lips of the Father or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor dispersed into the air, but having a real substance , Himself speaking, and working, and dispensing, and sanctifying; even as the Economy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which is to usward from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is inseparable and harmonious and one, as we have also said before. For I wish you to keep in mind those things which were lately spoken, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> clearly that there is not one Spirit in the Law and the Prophets, and another in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and Apostles; but that it is One and the Self-same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which both in the Old and in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, spoke the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>. </p>

<p>6. This is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who came upon the Holy Virgin Mary; for since He who was conceived was Christ the Only-begotten, the <em>power of the Highest overshadowed her</em>, and the <em><a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came upon her</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312131"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35</a></span>, and sanctified her, that she might be able to receive Him, <em>by whom all things were made</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312132"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> But I have no need of many words to teach you that generation was without defilement or taint, for you have learned it. It is Gabriel who says to her, I am the herald of what shall be done, but have no part in the work. Though an Archangel, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my place; and though I joyfully bid you All hail, yet how you shall bring forth, is not of any <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of mine. <em>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you; therefore also that Holy Thing which shall be born of you shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312133"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35</a></span> .</p>

<p>7. This <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> wrought in <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a>; for He recognises not <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> only, but matrons also, so that their marriage be lawful. <em>And</em>  <em><a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a> was filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312134"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;1:41</a></span>, and prophesied; and that noble hand-maiden says of her own Lord, <em>And whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord should come to me</em> ? For <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a> counted herself blessed. Filled with this <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Zacharias also, the father of John, prophesied , telling how many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things the Only-begotten should procure, and that John should be His harbinger  through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. By this <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> also it was revealed to just Symeon, <em>that he should not see death, till he had seen the Lord's Christ</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312138"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;2:26-35</a></span>; and he received Him in his arms, and bore clear testimony in the Temple concerning Him.</p>

<p>8. And John also, who had been filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from his mother's womb , was for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sanctified, that he might <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the Lord; not giving the Spirit himself, but preaching glad tidings of Him who gives the Spirit. For he says, <em>I indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with water unto repentance, but He that comes after me</em>, and the rest; <em>He shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and with fire</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312140"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;3:11</a></span> But wherefore with fire? Because the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was in fiery tongues; concerning which the Lord says joyfully, <em>I have come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312141"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span>?</p>

<p>9. This <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came down when the Lord was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that the dignity of Him who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> might not be hidden; as John says, <em>But He which sent me to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with water, the same said unto me, Upon whomsoever you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, the same is He which baptizes with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312142"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;1:33</a></span> But see what says the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; <em>the heavens were opened</em>; they were opened because of the dignity of Him who descended; for, <em>lo</em>, he says, <em>the heavens were opened, and he saw the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> descending as a dove, and lighting upon Him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312143"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;3:16</a></span>: that is, with <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> motion in His descent. For it was fit, as some have interpreted, that the primacy and <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>  of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> promised to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> should be conferred upon the manhood of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, who is the giver of such <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But perhaps He came down in the form of a dove, as some say, to exhibit a figure of that dove who is pure and innocent and undefiled, and also helps the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the children she has begotten, and for forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ; even as it was emblematically foretold that Christ should be thus manifested in the appearance of His eyes; for in the Canticles she cries concerning the Bridegroom, and says, <em>Your eyes are as doves by the rivers of water</em>. </p>

<p>10. Of this dove, the dove of Noe, according to some, was in part a figure.  For as in his time by means of wood and of water there came <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to themselves, and the beginning of a new generation, and the dove returned to him towards evening with an olive branch; thus, say they, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> also descended upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Noe, the Author of the second birth, who draws together into one the wills of all nations, of whom the various dispositions of the animals in the ark were a figure:&mdash; Him at whose coming the spiritual wolves feed with the lambs, in whose Church the calf, and the lion, and the ox, feed in the same pasture, as we behold to this day the rulers of the world guided and taught by Churchmen. The spiritual dove therefore, as some interpret, came down at the season of His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that He might show that it is He who by the wood of the Cross saves them who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, He who at eventide should grant <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through His death.</p>

<p>11. And these things perhaps should be otherwise explained; but now again we must hear the words of the Saviour Himself concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For He says, <em>Unless a man be born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312148"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;3:5</a></span> And that this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He thus states, <em>How much more shall your heavenly Father give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to them that ask him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312149"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;11:13</a></span> And that we ought to worship God in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, He shows thus, <em>But the hour comes and now is, when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worshippers shall worship the Father in Spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for the Father also seeks such to worship Him. God is a Spirit; and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312150"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;4:23</a></span> And again, <em>But if I by the</em>  <em><a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> cast out devils</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312151"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;12:28</a></span>; and immediately afterwards, <em>Therefore I say unto you, All manner of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> shall be forgiven unto men; but the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall not be forgiven.

And again He says, <em>And I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may be with you for ever, the Spirit of Truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees Him not, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him; but you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, for He abides with you, and shall be in you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312153"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;14:16</a></span> And again He says, <em>These things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you.

And again He says, <em>But when the Comforter has come, whom I will send unto you from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He shall testify of Me</em>.  And again the Saviour says, <em>For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you</em>. .... <em>And when He has come, He will convince the world of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, of righteousness, and of judgment</em> ; and afterwards again, <em>I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now.

He shall glorify Me, for He shall take of Mine, and shall announce it unto you.

I have read to you now the utterances of the Only-begotten Himself, that you may not give heed to men's words.</p>

<p>12. The fellowship of this <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> He bestowed on the Apostles; for it is written, <em>And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and says unto them, Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you retain, they are retained</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312159"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;20:22</a></span> This was the second time He breathed on man (His first breath  having been stifled through wilful <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>); that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> might be fulfilled, <em>He went up breathing upon your face, and delivering you from affliction</em>.  But whence went He up? From Hades; for thus the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> relates, that then after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> He breathed on them. But though He bestowed His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> then, He was to lavish it yet more bountifully; and He says to them, I am ready to give it even now, but the vessel cannot yet hold it; for a while therefore receive ye as much <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as you can bear; and look forward for yet more; <em>but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be clothed with power from on high</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312162"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;24:39</a></span> <em>Receive</em> it in part now; then, you shall wear it in its fullness. For he who receives, often possesses the gift but in part; but he who is clothed, is completely enfolded by his robe. <q>Fear not,</q> He says, <q>the weapons and darts of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; for you shall bear with you the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> But remember what was lately said, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not divided, but only the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is given by Him.</p>

<p>13. Jesus therefore went up into heaven, and fulfilled the promise. For He said to them, <em>I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and He shall give you another Comforter</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312163"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;14:16</a></span> So they were sitting, looking for the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; <em>and when the day of Pentecost was fully come</em>, here, in this city of Jerusalem,&mdash; (for this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> also belongs to us ; and we speak not of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which have happened among others, but of those which have been vouchsafed among ourselves,)&mdash; on the day of Pentecost, I say, they were sitting, and the Comforter came down from heaven, the Guardian and Sanctifier of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Ruler of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the Pilot of the tempest-tossed, who leads the wanderers to the light, and presides over the combatants, and crowns the victors.</p>

<p>14. But He came down to clothe the Apostles with power, and to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them; for the Lord says, <em>you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> not many days hence</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312165"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse5">Acts&nbsp;1:5</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was not in part, but His power was in full perfection; for as he who plunges into the waters and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is encompassed on all sides by the waters, so were they also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> completely by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. The water however flows round the outside only, but the Spirit baptizes also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> within, and that completely. And wherefore do you wonder? Take an example from matter; poor indeed and common, yet useful for the simpler sort. If the fire passing in through the mass of the iron makes the whole of it fire, so that what was cold becomes burning and what was black is made bright&mdash;if fire which is a body thus penetrates and works without hindrance in iron which is also a body, why wonder that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> enters into the very inmost recesses of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</p>

<p>15. And lest men should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the greatness of the mighty gift coming down to them, there sounded as it were a heavenly trumpet, For <em>suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312166"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;2:2</a></span>, signifying the presence of Him who was to grant power unto men to seize with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; that both their eyes might see the fiery tongues, and their ears hear the sound. <em>And it filled all the house where they were sitting</em>; for the house became the vessel of the spiritual water; as the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> sat within, the whole house was filled. Thus they were entirely <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> according to the promise, and invested <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body with a divine garment of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <em>And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they were all filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em>. They partook of fire, not of burning but of saving fire; of fire which consumes the thorns of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but gives lustre to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This is now coming upon you also, and that to strip away and consume your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are like thorns, and to brighten yet more that precious possession of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and to give you <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for He gave it then to the Apostles. And He sat upon them in the form of fiery tongues, that they might crown themselves with new and spiritual diadems by fiery tongues upon their heads. A fiery sword barred of old the gates of Paradise; a fiery tongue which brought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> restored the gift.</p>

<p>16. <em>And they began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance</em>.  The <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilean</a> Peter or Andrew spoke Persian or Median. John and the rest of the Apostles spoke every tongue to those of Gentile extraction; for not in our time have multitudes of strangers first begun to assemble here from all quarters, but they have done so since that time. What teacher can be found so great as to teach men all at once things which they have not learned? So many years are they in learning by grammar and other arts to speak only Greek well; nor yet do all speak this equally well; the Rhetorician perhaps succeeds in speaking well, and the Grammarian sometimes not well, and the skilful Grammarian is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the subjects of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> taught them many languages at once, languages which in all their life they never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. This is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> vast wisdom, this is power divine. What a contrast of their long <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in time past to their sudden, complete and varied and unaccustomed exercise of these languages!</p>

<p>17. The multitude of the hearers was confounded&mdash;it was a second confusion, in the room of that first <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one at <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. For in that confusion of tongues there was division of purpose, because their thought was at enmity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but here minds were restored and united, because the object of interest was godly. The means of falling were the means of recovery. Wherefore they marvelled, saying <span class="stiki" id="note312168"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;2:8</a></span>, <em>How hear we them speaking</em>? No marvel if you be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; for even <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and to him it was said, <em>The Spirit breathes where it lists, and you hear the voice thereof, but canst not tell whence it comes, and whither it goes</em> ; but if, even though I hear His voice, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whence he comes, how can I explain, what He is Himself in substance?</p>

<p>18. <em>But others mocking said, They are full of new wine</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312170"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;2:13</a></span>, and they spoke <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> though in mockery. For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the wine was new, even the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; but this new wine was from a spiritual Vine, which had oftentimes ere this borne fruit in Prophets, and had budded in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. For as in things sensible, the vine ever remains the same, but bears new fruits in its seasons, so also the self-same Spirit continuing what He is, as He had often wrought in Prophets, now manifested a new and marvellous work. For though His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> had come before to the Fathers also, yet here it came exuberantly; for formerly men only partook of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but now they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> completely.</p>

<p>19. But Peter who had the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what he possessed, says,  <em>Men of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></em>, you who preach Joel, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the things which are written, <em>these men are not drunken as you suppose</em>.  Drunken they are, not however as you suppose, but according to that which is written, <em>They shall be drunken with the fatness of your house; and you shall make them drink of the torrents of your pleasure</em>.  They are drunken, with a sober <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, deadly to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and life-giving to the heart, a <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> contrary to that of the body; for this last causes forgetfulness even of what was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but that bestows the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> even of what was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. They are drunken, for they have drunk the wine of the spiritual vine, which says, <em>I am the vine and you</em>  <em>are the branches</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312173"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;15:5</a></span> But if you are not persuaded by me, understand what I tell you from the very time of the day; for <em>it is the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> of the day</em>.  For He who, as Mark relates, was crucified at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, now at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> sent down His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not other than the Spirit's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but He who was then crucified, who also gave the promise, made good that which He promised. And if you would receive a testimony also, <em>Listen</em>, he says: <q> <em>But this is that which was spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Joel; And it shall come to pass after this, says <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I will pour forth of My Spirit</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312175"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel&nbsp;2:28</a></span> &mdash; (and this word, <em>I will pour forth</em>, implied a rich gift; <em>for God gives not the Spirit by measure, for the Father loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and has given all things into His hand</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312176"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;3:34-35</a></span>; and He has given Him the power also of bestowing the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the All-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit on whomsoever He will)&mdash; <em>I will pour forth of My Spirit unto all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy</em>; and afterwards, <em>Yea, and on My servants and on My handmaidens I will pour out in those days of My Spirit, and they shall prophesy</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312177"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse29">Joel&nbsp;2:29</a></span> .</q> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; for He seeks not dignities, but <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Let neither the rich be puffed up, nor the poor dejected, but only let each prepare himself for reception of the Heavenly gift.</p>

<p>20. We have said much today, and perchance you are weary of listening; yet more still remains. And in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> there were need of a third lecture; and of many besides. But we must have your indulgence on both points. For as the Holy Festival of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> is now at hand we have this day lengthened our discourse and yet we had not room to bring before you all the testimonies from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> which we ought. For many passages are still to come from the Acts of the Apostles in which the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> wrought mightily in Peter and in all the Apostles together; many also from the <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a>, and the fourteen Epistles of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; out of all which we will now endeavour to gather a few, like flowers from a large meadow, merely by way of remembrance.</p>

<p>21. For in the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Father and Son, Peter stood with the Eleven, and lifting up his voice, (according to the text, <em>Lift up your voice with strength, you that bringest good tidings to Jerusalem</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312178"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;40:9</a></span>), captured in the spiritual net of his words, <em>about three thousand <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a></em>. So great was the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which wrought in all the Apostles together, that, out of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, those crucifiers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, this great number <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <em>continued steadfastly in the Apostles' doctrine and in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312179"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse42">Acts&nbsp;2:42</a></span> And again in the same power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <em>Peter and John went up into the Temple at the hour of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which was the ninth hour</em> , and in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Name of Jesus</a> healed the man at the Beautiful gate, who had been lame from his mother's womb for forty years; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken, <em>Then shall the lame man leap as an hart</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312181"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;35:6</a></span> And thus, as they captured in the spiritual net of their doctrine five thousand <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> at once, so they confuted the misguided rulers of the people and chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and that, not through their own wisdom, for <em>they were unlearned and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312182"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;4:13</a></span>, but through the mighty power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; for it is written, <em>Then Peter filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> said to them</em>.  So great also was the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which wrought by means of the Twelve Apostles in them who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, that <em>they were of one heart and of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em> , and their enjoyment of their goods was common, the possessors piously offering the prices of their possessions, and no one among them wanting anything; while Ananias and Sapphira, who attempted to lie to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, underwent their befitting punishment.</p>

<p>22. <em>And by the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312185"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse12">Acts&nbsp;5:12</a></span> And so great was the spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> shed around the Apostles, that gentle as they were, they were the objects of dread; for <em>of the rest dared no man join himself to them; but the people magnified them; and multitudes were added of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on the Lord, both of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a></em>; and the streets were filled with the sick on their beds and couches, <em>that as Peter passed by, at least his shadow might overshadow some of them</em>. And <em>the multitude also of the cities round about came</em> unto this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Jerusalem, <em>bringing sick folk, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits, and they were healed every one</em> in this power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. </p>

<p>23. Again, after the Twelve Apostles had been cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> by the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for preaching Christ, and had been marvellously delivered from it at night by an Angel, and were brought before them in the judgment hall from the Temple, they fearlessly rebuked them in their discourse to them concerning Christ, and added this, that <em>God has also given His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to them that <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him</em>.  And when they had been scourged, they went their way rejoicing, and ceased not to <em>teach and preach Jesus as the Christ</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312188"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse42">Acts&nbsp;5:42</a></span> .</p>

<p>24. And it was not in the Twelve Apostles only that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> wrought, but also in the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> children of this once barren Church, I mean the seven Deacons; for these also were chosen, as it is written, being <em>full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and of wisdom</em>.  Of whom Stephen, rightly so named , the first fruits of the Martyrs, a man <em>full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, wrought great wonders and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> among the people</em>, and vanquished those who disputed with him; <em>for they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke</em>.  But when he was maliciously accused and brought to the judgment hall, he was radiant with angelic brightness; for <em>all they who sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face, as it had been the face of an Angel</em>.  And having by his wise defence confuted the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, those <em>stiffnecked men, uncircumcised in heart and ears, ever resisting the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em> , he beheld <em>the heavens opened</em>, and saw <em>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> standing on the right hand of God</em>. He saw Him, not by his own power, but, as the Divine <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <em>being full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God</em>. </p>

<p>25. In this power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Philip also in the Name of Christ at one time in the city of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> drove away the unclean spirits, <em>crying out with a loud voice</em>; and healed the palsied and the lame, and brought to Christ great multitudes of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. To whom Peter and John came down, and with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>, imparted the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> alone was declared an alien, and that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>. And at another time Philip was called by the Angel of the Lord in the way, for the sake of that most godly <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a>, the Eunuch, and heard distinctly the Spirit Himself saying, <em>Go near, and join yourself to this chariot</em>.  He instructed the Eunuch, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> him, and so having sent into <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> a herald of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according as it is written, <em><a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> shall soon stretch out her hand unto God</em> , he was caught away by the Angel, and preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in the cities in succession.</p>

<p>26. With this <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also had been filled after his calling by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Let godly Ananias come as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to what we say, he who in Damascus said to him, <em>The Lord, even Jesus who appeared to you in the way which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312197"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse17">Acts&nbsp;9:17</a></span> And straightway the Spirit's mighty working changed the blindness of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> eyes into newness of sight; and having vouchsafed His seal unto his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, made him <em>a chosen vessel</em> to <em>bear the Name</em> of the Lord who had appeared to him, <em>before kings and the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></em>, and rendered the former persecutor an ambassador and good servant&mdash;one, who <em>from Jerusalem, and even unto <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>, fully preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312198"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;15:19</a></span>, and instructed even imperial Rome, and carried the earnestness of his preaching as far as <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, undergoing conflicts innumerable, and performing signs and wonders. Of him for the present enough.</p>

<p>27. In the power of the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Peter also, the chief of the Apostles and the bearer of the keys  of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, healed &AElig;neas the paralytic in the Name of Christ at Lydda, which is now Diospolis, and at Joppa raised from the dead Tabitha rich in good works. And being on the housetop in a trance, he saw heaven opened, and by means of the vessel let down as it were a sheet full of beasts of every shape and sort, he learned plainly to call no man common or unclean, though he should be of the Greeks. <span class="stiki" id="note312200"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;10:11-16</a></span> And when he was sent for by Cornelius, he heard clearly the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself saying, <em>Behold, men seek you; but arise and get you down, and go with them, nothing doubting; for I have sent them</em>.  And that it might be plainly shown that those of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> are made partakers of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, when Peter had come to Cesarea, and was teaching the things concerning Christ, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says concerning Cornelius and them who were with him; <em>While Peter yet spoke these words, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> fell on all them which heard the word; so that they of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> also which came with Peter were astonished, and when they understood it said that on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also was poured out the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em>. </p>

<p>28. And in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> also, a most renowned city of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, when the preaching of Christ took effect, Barnabas was sent hence as far as <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> to help on the good work, being a <em><a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, and full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em> ; who seeing a great harvest of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, brought <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> from Tarsus to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, as his fellow-combatant. And when crowds had been instructed by them and assembled in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <em>it came to pass that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> first in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a></em> ; the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, methinks, bestowing on the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> that new Name, which had been promised before by the Lord. And the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit being shed forth by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more abundantly in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, there were there <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and teachers of whom <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a> was one. <span class="stiki" id="note312205"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;11:28</a></span> And <em>as they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> said, Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them</em>. And after hands had been laid on them, <em>they were sent forth by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em>.  Now it is manifest, that the Spirit which speaks and sends, is a living Spirit, subsisting, and operating, as we have said.</p>

<p>29. This <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who in unison with Father and Son has established the New Covenant in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, has set us free from the burdens of the law grievous to be borne&mdash;those I mean, concerning things common and unclean, and meats, and sabbaths, and new moons, and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and sprinklings, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; which were given for a season, and <em>had a shadow of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312207"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;10:1</a></span>, but which, when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> had come, were rightly withdrawn. For when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> were sent to the Apostles, because of the question moved at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> by them who said that it was necessary to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and to keep the customs of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the Apostles who were here at Jerusalem by a written injunction set free the whole world from all the legal and typical observances; yet they attributed not to themselves the full authority in so great a matter, but send an injunction in writing, and acknowledge this: <em>For it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; that you abstain from things <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication</em> ; showing evidently by what they wrote, that though the writing was by the hands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> Apostles, yet the decree is universal from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: which decree <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> took and confirmed unto all the world.</p>

<p>30. And now, having proceeded thus far in my discourse, I ask indulgence from your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> , or rather from the Spirit who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, if I should not be able to rehearse everything, by reason of my own weakness, and your weariness who listen. For when shall I in terms worthy of Himself declare the marvellous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> wrought by the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the Name of Christ? Those wrought in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> upon Elymas the sorcerer, and in Lystra at the healing of the cripple, and in Cilicia and Phrygia and Galatia and Mysia and Macedonia? Or those at Philippi (the preaching, I mean, and the driving out of the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> in the Name of Christ; and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the jailer with his whole house at night after the earthquake); or the events at Thessalonica; and the address at Areopagus in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>; or the instructions at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, and in all Achaia? How shall I worthily recount the mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which were wrought at Ephesus through <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <span class="stiki" id="note312210"><a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;19:1-6</a></span>? Whom they of that City <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not before, but came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him by the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; and when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had laid his hands on them, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> had come upon them, <em>they spoke with tongues, and prophesied</em>. And so great spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was upon him, that not only his touch wrought cures, but even the <em>handkerchiefs and napkins</em> , brought from his body, healed diseases, and scared away the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>; and at last <em>they also who practised curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a></em>. </p>

<p>31. I pass by the work wrought at <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a> on Eutychus, who <em>being borne down by his sleep fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead</em>; yet was saved alive by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.  I also pass by the prophecies addressed to the Elders of Ephesus whom he called to him in Miletus, to whom he openly said, <em>That the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> witnesses in every city, saying</em> &mdash; and the rest; for by saying, <em>in every city</em>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> made manifest that the marvellous works done by him in each city, were from the operative power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the Name of Christ who spoke in him. By the power of this <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was hastening to this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city Jerusalem, and this, though <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a> by the Spirit foretold what should befall him; and yet he spoke to the people with confidence, declaring the things concerning Christ. And when brought to Cesarea, and set amid tribunals of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, at one time before Felix, and at another before Festus the governor and King Agrippa, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> obtained of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> so great, and triumphant in wisdom, that at last Agrippa himself the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said, <em>Almost you persuade me to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a></em>.  This <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> granted to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when he was in the island of Melita also, to receive no harm when bitten by the viper, and to effect various cures on the diseased. This <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> guided him, the persecutor of old, as a herald of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even as far as imperial Rome, and there he persuaded many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to them who gainsaid he said plainly, <em>Well spoke the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by Esaias the Prophet, saying unto your fathers, and the rest</em>. </p>

<p>32. And that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and all his fellow Apostles, and they who after them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, hear from himself as he writes plainly in his Epistles; <em>And my speech</em>, he says, <em>and my preaching was not in persuasive words of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312217"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:4</a></span> And again, <em>But He who sealed us for this very purpose is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gave us the earnest of the Spirit</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312218"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse22">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:22</a></span> And again, <em>He that raised up Jesus from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit which dwells in you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312219"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;8:11</a></span> And again, writing to Timothy, <em>That good thing which was committed to you guard through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which was given to us</em>. </p>

<p>33. And that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> subsists, and lives, and speaks, and foretells, I have often said in what goes before, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writes it plainly to Timothy: <em>Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in later times some shall depart from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312221"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:1</a></span>&mdash;which we see in the divisions not only of former times but also of our own; so motley and diversified are the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. And again the same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <em>Which in other generations was not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as it has now been revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312222"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> And again, <em>Wherefore, as says the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312223"><a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse7">Hebrews&nbsp;3:7</a></span>; and again, <em>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> also witnesses to us</em>.  And again he calls unto the soldiers of righteousness, saying, <em>And take the helmet of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and the sword of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, with all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312225"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse17">Ephesians&nbsp;6:17</a></span> And again, <em>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, speaking to yourselves in psalms, and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and spiritual songs</em>.  And again, <em>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the communion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be with you all</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312227"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:14</a></span> .</p>

<p>34. By all these <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, and by more which have been passed over, is the personal, and sanctifying, and effectual power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> established for those who can understand; for the time would fail me in my discourse if I wished to quote what yet remains concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from the fourteen Epistles of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, wherein he has taught with such variety, completeness, and reverence. And to the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself it must belong, to grant to us forgiveness for what we have omitted because the days are few, and upon you the hearers to impress more perfectly the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what yet remains; while from the frequent reading of the sacred Scriptures those of you who are diligent come to understand these things, and by this time, both from these present Lectures, and from what has before been told you, hold more steadfastly the Faith in <q>One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty; and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, His Only-Begotten Son; and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> the Comforter.</q> Though the word itself and title of Spirit is applied to Them in common in the sacred Scriptures,&mdash; for it is said of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <em>God is a Spirit</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312228"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;4:24</a></span>, as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John; and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <em>A Spirit before our face, Christ the Lord</em> , as Jeremias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says; and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <em>the Comforter, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312230"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;14:25</a></span>, as was said&mdash;yet the arrangement of articles in the Faith, if religiously understood, disproves the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Sabellius also.  Return we therefore in our discourse to the point which now presses and is profitable to you.</p>

<p>35. Beware lest ever like Simon thou come to the dispensers of Baptism in hypocrisy, your heart the while not seeking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It is ours to protest, but it is yours to secure yourself. If <em>you stand in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312232"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;11:20</a></span>, blessed are you; if you have fallen in unbelief, from this day forward cast away your unbelief, and receive full assurance. For, at the season of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, when you have come before the Bishops, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a>, or Deacons &mdash;(for its <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is everywhere, in villages and in cities, on them of low as on them of high degree, on bondsmen and on freemen, for this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but the gift is from God through men,)&mdash; approach the Minister of Baptism, but approaching, think not of the face of him you see, but remember this <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> of whom we are now speaking. For He is present in readiness to seal your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and He shall give you that Seal at which <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> tremble, a heavenly and sacred seal, as also it is written, <em>In whom also ye <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and were sealed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of promise</em>. </p>

<p>36. Yet He tries the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He casts not His pearls before swine; if you play the hypocrite, though men <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you now, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> will not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you.  But if you approach with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, though men minister in what is seen, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> bestows that which is unseen. You are coming to a great trial, to a great muster , in that one hour, which if you throw away, your disaster is irretrievable; but if you be counted worthy of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be enlightened, you will receive a power which you had not, you will receive weapons terrible to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>; and if you cast not away your arms, but keep the Seal upon your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit will approach you; for he will be cowed; for verily by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> are the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> cast out.</p>

<p>37. If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, you shall not only receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but also do things which pass man's power.  And may thou be worthy of the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> also! For you shall receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> according to the measure of your capacity and not of my words; for I may possibly speak of but small things, yet you may receive greater; since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a large affair.  All your life long will your guardian the Comforter abide with you; He will care for you, as for his own soldier; for your goings out, and your comings in, and your plotting foes. And He will give you gifts of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of every kind, if you grieve Him not by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for it is written, <em>And grieve not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby you were sealed unto the day of redemption</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312239"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse30">Ephesians&nbsp;4:30</a></span> What then, beloved, is it to preserve <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? Be ready to receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and when you have received it, cast it not away.</p>

<p>38. And may the very God of All, who spoke by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who sent Him forth upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost in this place, Himself send Him forth at this time also upon you; and by Him keep us also, imparting His benefit in common to us all, that we may ever render up the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <em><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, meekness, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312240"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;5:22-23</a></span>, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>:&mdash; By whom and with whom, together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, both now, and ever, and for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
