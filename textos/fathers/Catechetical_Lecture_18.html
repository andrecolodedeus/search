<p><strong>On the Words, And in One Holy Catholic Church, and in the Resurrection of the Flesh, and the Life Everlasting.</strong></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/eze037.htm#verse1">Ezekiel 37:1</a></p>

<p>The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones.</p>

<p>1. The root of all good works is the hope of the Resurrection; for the expectation of the recompense nerves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to good works. For every labourer is ready to endure the toils, if he sees their reward in prospect; but when men weary themselves for nought, their heart soon sinks as well as their body. A soldier who expects a prize is ready for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, but no one is forward to die for a king who is indifferent about those who serve under him, and bestows no honours on their toils. In like manner every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> believing in a Resurrection is naturally careful of itself; but, disbelieving it, abandons itself to perdition. He who believes that his body shall remain to rise again, is careful of his robe, and defiles it not with fornication; but he who disbelieves the Resurrection, gives himself to fornication, and misuses his own body, as though it were not his own. Faith therefore in the Resurrection of the dead, is a great commandment and doctrine of the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; great and most necessary, though gainsaid by many, yet surely warranted by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Greeks contradict it , <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>  disbelieve it, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>  mutilate it; the contradiction is manifold, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is uniform.</p>

<p>2. Now Greeks and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> together argue against us thus. The dead man has fallen, and mouldered away, and is all turned into worms; and the worms have died also; such is the decay and destruction which has overtaken the body; how then is it to be raised? The shipwrecked have been devoured by fishes, which are themselves devoured. Of them who fight with wild beasts the very bones are ground to powder, and consumed by bears and lions. Vultures and ravens feed on the flesh of the unburied dead, and then fly away over all the world; whence then is the body to be collected? For of the fowls who have devoured it some may chance to die in India, some in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, some in the land of the Goths. Other men again are consumed by fire, and their very ashes scattered by rain or wind; whence is the body to be brought together again ?</p>

<p>3. To you, poor little feeble man, India is far from the land of the Goths, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> from <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>; but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who holds the whole <em>earth in the hollow of His hand</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312245"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;40:12</a></span>, all things are near at hand. Impute not then weakness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from a comparison of your feebleness, but rather dwell on His power.  Does then the sun, a small work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by one glance of his beams give warmth to the whole world; does the atmosphere, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made, encompass all things in the world; and is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the Creator both of the sun, and of the atmosphere, far off from the world? Imagine a mixture of seeds of different plants (for as you are weak concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the examples which I allege are weak also), and that these different seeds are contained in your single hand; is it then to you, who art a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, a difficult or an easy matter to separate what is in your hand, and to collect each seed according to its nature, and restore it to its own kind? Can you then separate the things in your hand, and cannot God separate the things contained in His hand, and restore them to their proper place? Consider what I say, whether it is not impious to deny it?</p>

<p>4. But further, attend, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, to the very principle of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and come to your own case. You have different sorts of servants: and some are good and some bad;  you honour therefore the good, and smitest the bad. And if you are a judge, to the good you award praise, and to the transgressors, punishment. Is then <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> observed by you a mortal man; and with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the ever changeless King of all, is there no retributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> ? Nay, to deny it is impious. For consider what I say. Many murderers have died in their beds unpunished; where then is the righteousness of God? Yea, ofttimes a murderer guilty of fifty murders is beheaded once; where then shall he suffer punishment for the forty and nine? Unless there is a judgment and a retribution after this world, you charge God with unrighteousness. Marvel not, however, because of the delay of the judgment; no combatant is crowned or disgraced, till the contest is over; and no president of the games ever crowns men while yet striving, but he waits till all the combatants are finished, that then deciding between them he may dispense the prizes and the chaplets.  Even thus God also, so long as the strife in this world lasts, succours the just but partially, but afterwards He renders to them their rewards fully.</p>

<p>5. But if according to you there is no resurrection of the dead, wherefore do you condemn the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> of graves? For if the body perishes, and there is no resurrection to be hoped for, why does the violator of the tomb undergo punishment? You see that though you deny it with your lips, there yet abides with you an indestructible instinct of the resurrection.</p>

<p>6. Further, does a tree after it has been cut down blossom again, and shall man after being cut down blossom no more? And does the grain sown and reaped remain for the threshing floor, and shall man when reaped from this world not remain for the threshing? And do shoots of vine or other trees, when clean cut off and transplanted, come to life and bear fruit; and shall man, for whose sake all these exist, fall into the earth and not rise again? Comparing efforts, which is greater, to mould from the beginning a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> which did not exist, or to recast in the same shape that which had fallen? Is God then, who created us out of nothing, unable to raise again those who exist and are fallen ? But you believe not what is written of the resurrection, being a Greek: then from the analogy of nature consider these matters, and understand them from what is seen to this day. Wheat, it may be, or some other kind of grain, is sown; and when the seed has fallen, it dies and rots, and is henceforth useless for food. But that which has rotted, springs up in verdure; and though small when sown, springs up most beautiful. Now wheat was made for us; for wheat and all seeds were created not for themselves, but for our use; are then the things which were made for us quickened when they die, and do we for whom they were made, not rise again after our death ?</p>

<p>7. The season is winter , as you see, the trees now stand as if they were dead: for where are the leaves of the fig-tree? Where are the clusters of the vine? These in winter time are dead, but green in spring; and when the season has come, there is restored to them a quickening as it were from a state of death. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> your unbelief, works a resurrection year by year in these visible things; that, beholding what happens to things inanimate, you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> concerning things animate and rational. Further, flies and bees are often drowned in water, yet after a while revive ; and species of dormice , after remaining motionless during the winter, are restored in the summer (for to your slight thoughts like examples are offered); and shall He who to irrational and despised creatures grants life supernaturally, not bestow it upon us, for whose sake He made them?</p>

<p>8. But the Greeks ask for a resurrection of the dead still manifest; and say that, even if these creatures are raised, yet they had not utterly mouldered away; and they require to see distinctly some creature rise again after complete decay. God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> men's unbelief, and provided for this purpose a bird, called a Phoenix.  This bird, as Clement writes, and as many more relate, being the only one of its kind , arrives in the land of the Egyptians at periods of five hundred years, showing forth the resurrection, not in desert places, lest the occurrence of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> should remain unknown, but appearing in a notable city , that men might even handle what would otherwise be disbelieved. For it makes itself a coffin  of frankincense and myrrh and other spices, and entering into this when its years are fulfilled, it evidently dies and moulders away. Then from the decayed flesh of the dead bird a worm is engendered, and this worm when grown large is transformed into a bird&mdash;and do not disbelieve this, for you see the offspring of bees also fashioned thus out of worms , and from eggs which are quite fluid you have seen wings and bones and sinews of birds issue. Afterwards the aforesaid Phoenix, becoming fledged and a full-grown Phoenix, like the former one, soars up into the air such as it had died, showing forth to men a most evident resurrection of the dead. The Phoenix indeed is a wondrous bird, yet it is irrational, nor ever sang praise to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; it flies abroad through the sky, but it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not who is the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Has then a resurrection from the dead been given to this irrational creature which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not its Maker, and to us who ascribe <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and keep His commandments, shall there no resurrection be granted?</p>

<p>9. But since the sign of the Phoenix is remote and uncommon, and men still disbelieve our resurrection, take again the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this from what you see every day. A hundred or two hundred years ago, we all, speakers and hearers, where were we? Know we not the groundwork of the substance of our bodies? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> how from weak and shapeless and simple  elements we are engendered, and out of what is simple and weak a living man is formed? And how that weak element being made flesh is changed into strong sinews, and bright eyes, and sensitive nose, and hearing ears, and speaking tongue, and beating heart, and busy hands, and swift feet, and into members of all kinds ? And how that once weak element becomes a shipwright, and a builder, and an architect, and a craftsman of various arts, and a soldier, and a ruler, and a lawgiver, and a king? Cannot God then, who has made us out of imperfect materials, raise us up when we have fallen into decay? He who thus flames a body out of what is vile, cannot He raise the fallen body again? And He who fashions that which is not, shall He not raise up that which is and is fallen?</p>

<p>10. Take further a manifest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the resurrection of the dead, witnessed month by month in the sky and its luminaries.  The body of the moon vanishes completely, so that no part of it is any more seen, yet it fills again, and is restored to its former state ; and for the perfect demonstration of the matter, the moon at certain revolutions of years suffering eclipse and becoming manifestly changed into blood, yet recovers its luminous body: God having provided this, that you also, the man who art formed of blood, might not refuse credence to the resurrection of the dead, but might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> concerning yourself also what you see in respect of the moon. These therefore use thou as arguments against the Greeks; for with them who receive not what is written fight thou with unwritten weapons, by reasonings only and demonstrations; for these men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not who <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is, nor Esaias, nor the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</p>

<p>11. Turn now to the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, who, receiving the Law only, allow not the Prophets. To them the text just now read from Ezekiel appears of no force, for, as I said, they admit no Prophets; whence then shall we persuade the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> also? Let us go to the writings of the Law. Now God says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <em>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and of Isaac, and of Jacob</em> ; this must mean of those who have being and subsistence. For if <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> has come to an end, and Isaac and Jacob, then He is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of those who have no being. When did a king ever say, I am the king of soldiers, whom he had not? When did any display <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which he possessed not? Therefore <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Isaac and Jacob must subsist, that God may be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of those who have being; for He said not, <q>I was their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> but <em>I am</em>. And that there is a judgment, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> shows in saying to the Lord, <em>He who judges all the earth, shall He not execute judgment</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312264"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse25">Genesis&nbsp;18:25</a></span>?</p>

<p>12. But to this the foolish <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> object again, and say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> possibly of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Isaac and Jacob continue, but that their bodies cannot possibly rise again. Was it then possible that the rod of righteous <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> should become a serpent, and is it impossible that the bodies of the righteous should live and rise again? And was that done contrary to nature, and shall they not be restored according to nature? Again, the rod of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, though cut off and dead, budded, <em>without the scent of waters</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312265"><a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse9">Job&nbsp;14:9</a></span>, and though under a roof, sprouted forth into blossoms as in the fields; and though set in dry places, yielded in one night the flowers and fruit of plants watered for many years. Did <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron's</a> rod rise, as it were, from the dead, and shall not <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> himself be raised? And did God work wonders in wood, to secure to him the high-<a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and will He not vouchsafe a resurrection to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> himself? A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> also was made <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> contrary to nature; and flesh was turned into <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>; and shall not flesh be restored to flesh? Was <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife made a pillar of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, and shall not <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> wife be raised again? By what power was <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> hand changed, which even within one hour became as snow, and was restored again? Certainly by God's command. Was then His command of force then, and has it no force now?</p>

<p>13. And whence in the beginning came man into being at all, O you <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, most senseless of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? Go to the first book of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, which even you receive; <em>And God formed man of the dust of the ground</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312266"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;2:7</a></span> Is dust transformed into flesh, and shall not flesh be again restored to flesh? You must be asked too, whence the heavens had their being, and earth, and seas? Whence sun, and moon, and stars? How from the waters were made the things which fly and swim? And how from earth all its living things? Were so many myriads brought from nothing into being, and shall we men, who bear God's image, not be raised up? Truly this course is full of unbelief, and the unbelievers are much to be condemned; when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> addresses the Lord as <em>the Judge of all the earth</em>, and the learners of the Law disbelieve; when it is written that man is of the earth, and the readers disbelieve it. </p>

<p>14. These questions, therefore, are for them, the unbelievers: but the words of the Prophets are for us who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. But since some who have also used the Prophets <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not what is written, and allege against us that passage, <em>The ungodly shall not rise up in judgment</em> , and, <em>For if man go down to the grave he shall come up no more</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312269"><a href="../bible/job007.htm#verse9">Job&nbsp;7:9</a></span>, and, <em>The dead shall not praise You, O Lord</em> &mdash;for of what is well written, they have made ill use&mdash; it will be well in a cursory manner, and as far as is now possible, to meet them. For if it is said, that <em>the ungodly shall not rise up in judgment</em>, this shows that they shall rise, not in judgment, but in condemnation; for God needs not long scrutiny, but close on the resurrection of the ungodly follows also their punishment. And if it is said, <em>The dead shall not praise You, O Lord</em>, this shows, that since in this life only is the appointed time for repentance and pardon, for which they who enjoy it shall <em>praise the Lord</em>, it remains not after death for them who have died in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to give praise as the receivers of a blessing, but to bewail themselves; for praise belongs to them who give thanks, but to them who are under the scourge, lamentation. Therefore the just then offer praise; but they who have died in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have no further season for confession. </p>

<p>15. And respecting that passage, <em>If a man go down to the grave, he shall come up no more</em>, observe what follows, for it is written, <em>He shall come up no more, neither shall he return to his own house</em>. For since the whole world shall pass away, and every house shall be destroyed, how shall he return to his own house, there being henceforth a new and different earth? But they ought to have heard Job, saying, <em>For there is hope of a tree; for if it be cut down, it will sprout again, and the tender branch thereof will not cease. For though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the rocky ground; yet from the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth a crop like a new plant. But man when he dies, is gone; and when mortal man falls, is he no more</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312272"><a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse7">Job&nbsp;14:7-10</a></span>? As it were remonstrating and reproving (for thus ought we to read the words <em>is no more</em> with an interrogation ); he says since a tree falls and revives, shall not man, for whom all trees were made, himself revive? And that you may not suppose that I am forcing the words, read what follows; for after saying by way of question, <em>When mortal man falls, is he no more?</em> he says, <em>For if a man die, he shall live again </em>; and immediately he adds, <em>I will wait till I be made again</em> ; and again elsewhere, <em>Who shall raise up on the earth my skin, which endures these things</em>.  And Esaias the Prophet says, <em>The dead men shall rise again, and they that are in the tombs shall awake</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312277"><a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;26:19</a></span> And the Prophet Ezekiel now before us, says most plainly, <em>Behold I will open your graves, and bring you up out of your graves</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312278"><a href="../bible/eze037.htm#verse12">Ezekiel&nbsp;37:12</a></span> And Daniel says, <em>Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall arise, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312279"><a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse2">Daniel&nbsp;12:2</a></span> .</p>

<p>16. And many Scriptures there are which testify of the Resurrection of the dead; for there are many other sayings on this matter. But now, by way of remembrance only, we will make a passing mention of the raising of Lazarus on the fourth day; and just allude, because of the shortness of the time, to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> son also who was raised, and merely for the sake of reminding you, let me mention the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue's</a> daughter, and the rending of the rocks, and how <em>there arose many bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> which slept</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312280"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse52">Matthew&nbsp;27:52</a></span>, their graves having been opened. But specially be it remembered that <em>Christ has been raised from the dead</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312281"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:20</a></span> I speak but in passing of Elias, and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> son whom he raised; of Elisseus also, who raised the dead twice; once in his lifetime, and once after his death. For when alive he wrought the resurrection by means of his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <span class="stiki" id="note312282"><a href="../bible/2ki004.htm#verse34">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;4:34</a></span>; but that not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> only of the just might be honoured, but that it might be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that in the bodies also of the just there lies a power, the corpse which was cast into the sepulchre of Elisseus, when it touched the dead body of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, was quickened, and the dead body of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> did the work of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and that which was dead and buried gave life to the dead, and though it gave life, yet continued itself among the dead. Wherefore? Lest if Elisseus should rise again, the work should be ascribed to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone; and to show, that even though the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not present, a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> resides in the body of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, because of the righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which has for so many years dwelt in it, and used it as its minister.  And let us not foolishly disbelieve, as though this thing had not happened: for if handkerchiefs and aprons, which are from without, touching the bodies of the diseased, raised up the sick, how much more should the very body of the Prophet raise the dead?</p>

<p>17. And with respect to these instances we might say much, rehearsing in detail the marvellous circumstances of each event: but as you have been already wearied both by the superposed fast of the Preparation , and by the watchings , let what has been cursorily spoken concerning them suffice for a while; these words having been as it were sown thinly, that you, receiving the seed like richest ground, may in bearing fruit increase them. But be it remembered, that the Apostles also raised the dead; Peter raised Tabitha in Joppa, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> raised Eutychus in <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>; and thus did all the other Apostles, even though the wonders wrought by each have not all been written. Further, remember all the sayings in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wrote against them who said, <em>How are the dead raised, and with</em>  <em>what manner of body do they come</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312286"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse35">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:35</a></span>? And how he says, <em>For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised</em> ; and how he called them <em>fools</em> , who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not; and remember the whole of his teaching there concerning the resurrection of the dead, and how he wrote to the Thessalonians, <em>But we would not have you to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as the rest which have no hope</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312289"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:13</a></span>, and all that follows: but chiefly that, <em>And the dead in Christ shall rise first</em>. </p>

<p>18. But especially mark this, how very pointedly  <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <em>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312292"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53</a></span> For this body shall be raised not remaining weak as now; but raised the very same body, though by putting on incorruption it shall be fashioned anew &mdash;as iron blending with fire becomes fire, or rather as He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how, the Lord who raises us. This body therefore shall be raised, but it shall abide not such as it now is, but an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> body; no longer needing for its life such nourishment as now, nor stairs for its ascent, for it shall be made <em>spiritual</em>, a marvellous thing, such as we cannot worthily speak of. <em>Then</em>, it is said, <em>shall the righteous shine forth as the sun</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312294"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse43">Matthew&nbsp;13:43</a></span>, and the moon, <em>and as the brightness of the firmament</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312295"><a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse3">Daniel&nbsp;12:3</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fore-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> men's unbelief, has given to little worms in the summer to dart beams of light from their body , that from what is seen, that which is looked for might be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; for He who gives in part is able to give the whole also, and He who made the worm radiant with light, will much more illuminate a righteous man.</p>

<p>19. We shall be raised therefore, all with our bodies <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but not all with bodies alike: for if a man is righteous, he will receive a heavenly body, that he may be able worthily to hold converse with Angels; but if a man is a sinner, he shall receive an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> body, fitted to endure the penalties of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that he may burn <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> in fire, nor ever be consumed.  And righteously will God assign this portion to either company; for we do nothing without the body. We <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> with the mouth, and with the mouth we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. With the body we commit fornication, and with the body we keep <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. With the hand we rob, and by the hand we bestow <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; and the rest in like manner. Since then the body has been our minister in all things, it shall also share with us in the future the fruits of the past. </p>

<p>20. Therefore, brethren, let us be careful of our bodies, nor misuse them as though not our own. Let us not say like the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that this vesture of the body belongs not to us, but let us be careful of it as our own; for we must give account to the Lord of all things done through the body. Say not, none sees me; think not, that there is no <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the deed. Human <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> oftentimes there is not; but He who fashioned us, an unerring <em><a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a></em>, abides <em>faithful in heaven</em> , and beholds what you do. And the stains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also remain in the body; for as when a wound has gone deep into the body, even if there has been a healing, the scar remains, so <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> wounds <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and the marks of its scars remain in all; and they are removed only from those who receive the washing of Baptism. The past wounds therefore of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body God heals by Baptism; against future ones let us one and all jointly guard ourselves, that we may keep this vestment of the body pure, and may not for practising fornication and sensual indulgence or any other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for a short season, lose the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of heaven, but may inherit the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; of which may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of His own <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, deem all of you worthy.</p>

<p>21. Thus much in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the Resurrection of the dead; and now, let me again recite to you the profession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and do you with all diligence pronounce it while I speak , and remember it.</p>

<p>______________________</p>

<p>22. The Faith which we rehearse contains in order the following, <q>And in one Baptism of repentance for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and in one Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and in the resurrection of the flesh; and in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> Now of Baptism and repentance I have spoken in the earliest Lectures; and my present remarks concerning the resurrection of the dead have been made with reference to the Article <q>In the resurrection of the flesh.</q> Now then let me finish what still remains to be said for the Article, <q>In one Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,</q> on which, though one might say many things, we will speak but briefly.</p>

<p>23. It is called <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> then because it extends over all the world, from one end of the earth to the other; and because it teaches universally and completely one and all the doctrines which ought to come to men's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, concerning things both visible and invisible, heavenly and earthly ; and because it brings into subjection to godliness the whole race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, governors and governed, learned and unlearned; and because it universally treats and heals the whole class of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are committed by <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or body, and possesses in itself every form of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is named, both in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and words, and in every kind of spiritual gifts.</p>

<p>24. And it is rightly named (Ecclesia) because it calls forth  and assembles together all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; according as the Lord says in Leviticus, <em>And make an assembly for all the congregation at the door of the tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a></em>.  And it is to be noted, that the word <em>assemble</em>, is used for the first time in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> here, at the time when the Lord puts <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> into the High-<a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. And in Deuteronomy also the Lord says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <em>Assemble the people unto Me, and let them hear My words, that they may learn to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312304"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:10</a></span> And he again mentions the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when he says concerning the Tables, <em>And on them were written all the words which the Lord spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the Assembly</em> ; as if he had said more plainly, in the day in which you were called and gathered together by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The Psalmist also says, <em>I will give thanks unto You, O Lord, in the great Congregation; I will praise You among much people</em>. </p>

<p>25. Of old the Psalmist sang, <em>Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, (ye that are) from the fountains of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></em>.  But after the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for the plots which they made against the Saviour were cast away from His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the Saviour built out of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> a second Holy Church, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of us <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, concerning which he said to Peter, <em>And upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against it</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312308"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> And David prophesying of both these, said plainly of the first which was rejected, <em>I have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the Congregation of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doers</em> ; but of the second which is built up he says in the same Psalm, <em>Lord, I have loved the beauty of Your house</em> ; and immediately afterwards, <em>In the Congregations will I bless you, O Lord</em>.  For now that the one Church in Jud&aelig;a is cast off, the Churches of Christ are increased over all the world; and of them it is said in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <em>Sing unto the Lord a new song, His praise in the Congregation of Saints</em>.  Agreeably to which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> also said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <em>I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord Almighty</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312313"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse10">Malachi&nbsp;1:10</a></span>; and immediately afterwards, <em>For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, My name is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a></em>.  Concerning this Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writes to Timothy, <em>That you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how you ought to behave yourself in the House of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the pillar and ground of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312315"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:15</a></span> .</p>

<p>26. But since the word Ecclesia is applied to different things (as also it is written of the multitude in the theatre of the Ephesians, <em>And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the Assembly</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312316"><a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse14">Acts&nbsp;19:14</a></span>), and since one might properly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> say that there is a <em>Church of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doers</em>, I mean the meetings of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionists</a> and Manichees, and the rest, for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the Faith has securely delivered to you now the Article, <q>And in one Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>;</q> that you may avoid their wretched meetings, and ever abide with the Holy Church <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in which you were regenerated. And if ever you are sojourning in cities, inquire not simply where the Lord's House is (for the other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of the profane also attempt to call their own dens houses of the Lord), nor merely where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is, but where is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For this is the peculiar name of this Holy Church, the mother of us all, which is the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> (for it is written, <em>As Christ also loved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and gave Himself for it</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312317"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians&nbsp;5:25</a></span>, and all the rest,) and is a figure and copy of <em>Jerusalem which is above, which is free, and the mother of us all</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312318"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse26">Galatians&nbsp;4:26</a></span>; which before was barren, but now has many children.</p>

<p>27. For when the first Church was cast off, in the second, which is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, God <em>has set</em>, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <em>first Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdly teachers, then <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, various kinds of tongues</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312319"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:28</a></span>, and every sort of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, I mean wisdom and understanding, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, mercy and loving-kindness, and patience unconquerable in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>. She, <em>by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and dishonour</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312320"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:7-8</a></span>, in former days amid <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> and tribulations crowned the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> with the varied and blooming chaplets of patience, and now in times of peace by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> receives her due honours from <em>kings and those who are in high place</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312321"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:2</a></span>, and from every sort and kindred of men. And while the kings of particular nations have bounds set to their authority, the Holy Church <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> alone extends her power without limit over the whole world; <em>for God</em>, as it is written, <em>has made her border peace</em>.  But I should need many more hours for my discourse, if I wished to speak of all things which concern her.</p>

<p>______________________</p>

<p>28. In this Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> receiving instruction and behaving ourselves virtuously, we shall attain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and inherit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; for which also we endure all toils, that we may be made partakers thereof from the Lord. For ours is no trifling aim, but our endeavour is for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Wherefore in the profession of the Faith, after the words, <q>And in the resurrection of the flesh,</q> that is, of the dead (of which we have discoursed), we are taught to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also <q>in the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>,</q> for which as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> we are striving.</p>

<p>29. The real and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life then is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who through the Son in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> pours forth as from a fountain His heavenly gifts to all; and through His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the blessings of the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> are promised without fail to us men also. We must not disbelieve the possibility of this, but having an eye not to our own weakness but to His power, we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; <em>for with God all things are possible</em>. And that this is possible, and that we may look for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, Daniel declares, <em>And of the many righteous shall they shine as the stars for ever and ever</em>.  And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <em>And so shall we be ever with the Lord</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312324"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:17</a></span>: for the <em>being for ever with the Lord</em> implies the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But most plainly of all the Saviour Himself says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <em>And these shall go away into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, but the righteous into life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312325"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;25:46</a></span> .</p>

<p>30. And many are the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> concerning the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And when we desire to gain this <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, the sacred Scriptures suggest to us the ways of gaining it; of which, because of the length of our discourse, the texts we now set before you shall be but few, the rest being left to the search of the diligent. They declare at one time that it is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for it is written, <em>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in the Son has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312326"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;3:36</a></span>, and what follows; and again He says Himself, <em>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hears My word, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> Him that sent Me, has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</em> , and the rest. At another time, it is by the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; for He says, that <em>He that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit unto life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a></em>.  At another time, by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and confession in Christ's name; for He says, <em>And he that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his life in this world, shall keep it unto life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a></em>.  And again, by preferring Christ to riches or kindred; <em>And every one that has forsaken brethren, or sisters</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312330"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;19:29</a></span>, and the rest, <em>shall inherit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</em>. Moreover it is by keeping the commandments, <em>You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, You shall not kill</em> , and the rest which follow; as He answered to him that came to Him, and said, <em>Good Master, what shall I do that I may have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312332"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse17">Mark&nbsp;10:17</a></span>? But further, it is by departing from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works, and henceforth serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <em>But now being made free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and become servants to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312333"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse22">Romans&nbsp;6:22</a></span> .</p>

<p>31. And the ways of finding <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life are many, though I have passed over them by reason of their number. For the Lord in His loving-kindness has opened, not one or two only, but many doors, by which to enter into the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that, as far as lay in Him, all might enjoy it without hindrance. Thus much have we for the present spoken within compass concerning the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, which is the last doctrine of those professed in the Faith, and its termination; which life may we all, both teachers and hearers, by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> enjoy!</p>

<p>______________________</p>

<p>32. And now, brethren beloved, the word of instruction exhorts you all, to prepare your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for the reception of the heavenly gifts. As regards the Holy and Apostolic Faith delivered to you to profess, we have spoken through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord as many Lectures, as was possible, in these past days of Lent; not that this is all we ought to have said, for many are the points omitted; and these perchance are thought out better by more excellent teachers. But now the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> is at hand, and you, beloved  in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are to be enlightened <em>by the Laver of regeneration</em>. You shall therefore again be taught what is requisite,  if God so will; with how great devotion and order you must enter in when summoned, for what purpose each of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Baptism is performed, and with what reverence and order you must go from Baptism to the Holy Altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and enjoy its spiritual and heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; that your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> being previously enlightened by the word of doctrine, you may discover in each particular the greatness of the gifts bestowed on you by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>33. And after Easter's Holy Day of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, you shall come on each successive day, beginning from the second day of the week, after the assembly into the Holy Place of the Resurrection , and there, if God permit, you shall hear other Lectures; in which you shall again be taught the reasons of every thing which has been done, and shall receive the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> thereof from the Old and New Testaments,&mdash; first, of the things done just before Baptism,&mdash; next, how you were cleansed from your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by the Lord, <em>by the washing of water with the word</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312336"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse26">Ephesians&nbsp;5:26</a></span>&mdash;and how like Priests you have become partakers of the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash;and how the Seal of the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was given to you&mdash;and concerning the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> at the Altar of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which have taken their beginning from this place, both what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> have delivered to us, and what is the power of these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and how ye must approach them, and when and how receive them&mdash;and at the end of all, how for the time to come ye must behave yourselves worthily of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> both in words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, that you may all be enabled to enjoy the life everlasting. And these things shall be spoken, if it be God's pleasure.</p>

<p>34. <em>Finally, my brethren, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice: for your redemption has drawn near</em> , and the heavenly host of the Angels is waiting for your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And there is now <em>the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312338"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;40:3</a></span>; and the Prophet cries, <em>Ho, you that thirst, come ye to the water</em> ; and immediately afterwards, <em>Hearken unto me, and you shall eat that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall delight itself in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things</em>.  And within a little while you shall hear that excellent lesson which says, <em>Shine, shine, O thou new Jerusalem; for your light has come</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312341"><a href="../bible/isa060.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;60:1</a></span> Of this Jerusalem the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has said, <em>And afterwards you shall be called the city of righteousness, Zion, the faithful mother of cities</em> ; <em>because of the law which went forth out of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem</em> , which word has from hence been showered forth on the whole world. To her the Prophet also says concerning you, <em>Lift up your eyes round about, and behold your children gathered together</em> ; and she answers, saying, <em>Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as doves with their young ones to me</em> ? (<em>clouds</em> because of their spiritual nature, and <em>doves</em>, from their purity). And again, she says, <em>Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> such things? Or who has seen it thus? Did ever a land bring forth in one day? Or was ever a nation born all at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children</em>.  And all things shall be filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> unspeakable because of the Lord who said, <em>Behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a></em>. </p>

<p>35. And may these words be spoken now again over you also, <em>Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth</em>; and then; <em>for the Lord has had mercy on His people, and comforted the lowly of His people</em>.  And this shall come to pass through the loving-kindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who says to you, <em>Behold, I will blot out as a cloud your transgressions, and as a thick cloud your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312349"><a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse22">Isaiah&nbsp;44:22</a></span> But ye who have been counted worthy of the name of Faithful (of whom it is written, <em>Upon My servants shall be called a new name which shall be blessed on the earth</em> ,) you shall say with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, <em>Blessed be the God and Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312351"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;1:3</a></span> <em>: in whom we have our redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, wherein He abounded towards us</em> , and what follows; and again, <em>But God being rich in mercy, for His great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith He loved us, when we were dead through our trespasses, quickened us together with Christ</em> , and the rest. And again in like manner praise ye the Lord of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, saying, <em>But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we had done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which He shed on us abundantly through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Saviour, that being</em>  <em>justified by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, we might be made heirs, according to hope, of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312354"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse4">Titus&nbsp;3:4</a></span> And may God Himself the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Father of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <em>give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312355"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse17">Ephesians&nbsp;1:17-18</a></span>, and may He ever keep you in good works, and words, and thoughts; to Whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and power, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, now and ever, and unto all the endless ages of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>
