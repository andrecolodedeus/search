<h1>Catechetical Lecture 19</h1>

<p><strong>First Lecture on the Mysteries.</strong></p>

<p>With a Lesson from the <a href="../bible/1pe000.htm">First General Epistle of Peter</a>, beginning at <em>Be sober, be vigilant</em>, to the end of the Epistle.</p>

<p>1. I have long been wishing, O true-born and dearly beloved children of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to discourse to you concerning these spiritual and heavenly Mysteries; but since I well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that seeing is far more persuasive than hearing, I waited for the present season; that finding you more open to the influence of my words from your present experience, I might lead you by the hand into the brighter and more fragrant meadow of the Paradise before us; especially as you have been made fit to receive the more sacred Mysteries, after having been found worthy of divine and life-giving Baptism.  Since therefore it remains to set before you a table of the more perfect instructions, let us now teach you these things exactly, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the effect  wrought upon you on that evening of your <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>2. First ye entered into the vestibule  of the Baptistery, and there facing towards the West ye listened to the command to stretch forth your hand, and as in the presence of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> ye renounced him. Now ye must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this figure is found in ancient history. For when <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, that most bitter and cruel tyrant, was oppressing the free and high-born people of the Hebrews, God sent <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to bring them out of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> bondage of the Egyptians. Then the door posts were anointed with the blood of a lamb, that the destroyer might flee from the houses which had the sign of the blood; and the Hebrew people was marvellously delivered. The enemy, however, after their rescue, <em>pursued after them</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312361"><a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse9">Exodus&nbsp;14:9,&nbsp;23</a></span>, and saw the sea wondrously parted for them; nevertheless he went on, following close in their footsteps, and was all at once overwhelmed and engulphed in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>.</p>

<p>3. Now turn from the old to the new, from the figure to the reality. There we have <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> sent from God to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; here, Christ, sent forth from His Father into the world: there, that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> might lead forth an afflicted people out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; here, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might rescue those who are oppressed in the world under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: there, the blood of a lamb was the spell against  the destroyer; here, the blood of the Lamb without blemish <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is made the charm to scare  <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>: there, the tyrant was pursuing that ancient people even to the sea; and here the daring and shameless spirit, the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, was following you even to the very streams of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The tyrant of old was drowned in the sea; and this present one disappears in the water of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>4. But nevertheless you are bidden to say, with arm outstretched towards him as though he were present, <q>I renounce you, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>.</q> I wish also to say wherefore ye stand facing to the West; for it is necessary. Since the West is the region of sensible darkness, and he being darkness has his dominion also in darkness, therefore, looking with a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> meaning towards the West, you renounce that dark and gloomy potentate. What then did each of you stand up and say? <q>I renounce you, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,</q>&mdash; you <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and most cruel tyrant! Meaning, <q>I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> your might no longer; for that Christ has overthrown, having partaken with me of flesh and blood, that through these He <em>might by death destroy death</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312364"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;2:14-15</a></span>, that I might not be made <em>subject to bondage</em> for ever.</q> <q>I renounce you,</q>&mdash; you crafty and most subtle serpent. <q>I renounce you,</q>&mdash; plotter as you are, who under the guise of friendship contrived all disobedience, and work <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> in our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. <q>I renounce you, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,</q>&mdash; the artificer and abettor of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<p>5. Then in a second sentence you are taught to say, <q>and all your works.</q> Now the works of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> are all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which also you must renounce&mdash;just as one who has escaped a tyrant has surely escaped his weapons also. All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> therefore, of every kind, is included in the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this; that all that you say, especially at that most thrilling hour, is written in God's books; when therefore you do any thing contrary to these promises, you shall be judged as a <em>transgressor</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312365"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse18">Galatians&nbsp;2:18</a></span> You renounce therefore the works of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; I mean, all <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and thoughts which are contrary to reason.</p>

<p>6. Then you say, <q>And all his pomp. </q> Now the pomp of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of theatres , and horse-races, and hunting, and all such vanity: from which that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to be delivered says unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity</em>.  Be not interested in the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of the theatre, where you will behold the wanton gestures of the players , carried on with mockeries and all unseemliness, and the frantic dancing of effeminate men &mdash;nor in the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of them who in hunts  expose themselves to wild beasts, that they may pamper their miserable appetite; who, to serve their belly with meats, become themselves in reality meat for the belly of untamed beasts; and to speak <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, for the sake of their own god, their belly, they cast away their life headlong in single combats.  Shun also horse-races, that frantic and soul-subverting spectacle.  For all these are the pomp of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>7. Moreover, the things which are hung up at idol festivals , either meat or bread, or other such things polluted by the invocation of the unclean spirits, are reckoned in the pomp of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For as the Bread and Wine of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> before the invocation of the Holy and Adorable Trinity were simple bread and wine, while after the invocation the Bread becomes the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the Wine the Blood of Christ , so in like manner such meats belonging to the pomp of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, though in their own nature simple, become profane by the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit.</p>

<p>8. After this you say, <q>and all your service. </q> Now the service of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in idol temples; things done in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of lifeless <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; the lighting of lamps , or burning of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> by fountains or rivers , as some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> cheated by dreams or by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> do [resort to this ], thinking to find a cure even for their bodily ailments. Go not after such things. The watching of birds, <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, omens, or amulets, or charms written on leaves, sorceries, or other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arts , and all such things, are services of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; therefore shun them. For if after renouncing <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and associating yourself with Christ , thou fall under their influence, you shall find  the tyrant more bitter; perchance, because he treated you of old as his own, and relieved you from his hard bondage, but has now been greatly exasperated by you; so you will be bereaved of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and have experience of the other. Have you not heard the old history which tells us of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> and his daughters? Was not he himself saved with his daughters, when he had gained the mountain, while his wife became a pillar of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, set up as a monument for ever, in remembrance of her depraved will and her turning back. Take heed therefore to yourself, and turn not again to <em>what is behind</em> , having put your hand to the plough, and then turning back to the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> savour of this life's doings; but escape to the mountain, to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, that <em>stone hewn without hands</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312384"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse35">Daniel&nbsp;2:35,&nbsp;45</a></span>, which has filled the world.</p>

<p>9. When therefore you renounce <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, utterly breaking all your covenant with him, that ancient <em>league with <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312385"><a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;28:15</a></span>, there is opened to you the paradise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which He planted towards the East, whence for his transgression our first father was banished; and a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of this was your turning from West to East, the place of light.  Then you were told to say, <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and in one Baptism of repentance. </q> Of which things we spoke to you at length in the former Lectures, as God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> allowed us.</p>

<p>10. Guarded therefore by these discourses, <em>be sober</em>. <em>For</em> our <em>adversary the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a></em>, as was just now read, <em>as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312388"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:9</a></span> But though in former times death was mighty and devoured, at the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Laver of regeneration God has <em>wiped away every tear from off all faces</em>.  For you shall no more mourn, now that you have put off the old man; but you shall keep holy-day , <em>clothed in the garment of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312391"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;61:10</a></span>, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>11. And these things were done in the outer chamber. But if God will, when in the succeeding lectures on the Mysteries we have entered into the Holy of Holies , we shall there <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> meaning of the things which are there performed. Now to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, with the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and power, and majesty, forever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
