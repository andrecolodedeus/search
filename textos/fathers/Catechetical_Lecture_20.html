<h1>Catechetical Lecture 20</h1>

<p><strong>(On the Mysteries. II.)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Of Baptism.</strong></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans 6:3-14</a></p>

<p>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that so many of us as were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into His death? etc.....for you are not under the Law, but under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>1. These daily introductions into the Mysteries , and new instructions, which are the announcements of new truths, are profitable to us; and most of all to you, who have been renewed from an old state to a new. Therefore, I shall necessarily lay before you the sequel of yesterday's Lecture, that you may learn of what those things, which were done by you in the inner chamber , were <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a>.</p>

<p>2. As soon, then, as you entered, you put off your tunic; and this was an image of <em>putting off the old man with his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312395"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse9">Colossians&nbsp;3:9</a></span> Having stripped yourselves, you were naked; in this also imitating Christ, who was stripped naked on the Cross, and by His nakedness <em>put off from Himself the principalities and powers, and openly triumphed over them on the tree</em>.  For since the adverse powers made their lair in your members, you may no longer wear that old garment; I do not at all mean this visible one, but the <em>old man, which waxes corrupt in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of deceit</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312397"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse22">Ephesians&nbsp;4:22</a></span> May the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which has once put him off, never again put him on, but say with the Spouse of Christ in the Song of Songs, <em>I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312398"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse3">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;5:3</a></span>? O wondrous thing! You were naked in the sight of all, and were not ashamed ; for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> ye bore the likeness of the first-formed Adam, who was naked in the garden, and was not ashamed.</p>

<p>3. Then, when you were stripped, you were anointed with exorcised oil , from the very hairs of your head to your feet, and were made partakers of the good olive-tree, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. For you were cut off from the wild olive-tree , and grafted into the good one, and were made to share the fatness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> olive-tree. The exorcised oil therefore was a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the participation of the fatness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, being a charm to drive away every trace of hostile influence. For as the breathing of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and the invocation of the Name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, like fiercest flame, scorch and drive out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> , so also this exorcised oil receives such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by the invocation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as not only to burn and cleanse away the traces of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but also to chase away all the invisible powers of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one.</p>

<p>4. After these things, you were led to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> pool  of Divine Baptism, as Christ was carried from the Cross to the Sepulchre which is before our eyes. And each of you was asked, whether he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and you made that saving confession, and descended three times into the water, and ascended again; here also hinting by a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> at the three days burial of Christ.  For as our Saviour passed three days and three nights in the heart of the earth, so you also in your first ascent out of the water, represented the first day of Christ in the earth, and by your descent, the night; for as he who is in the night, no longer sees, but he who is in the day, remains in the light, so in the descent, as in the night, you saw nothing, but in ascending again you were as in the day. And at the self-same moment you were both dying and being born; and that Water of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was at once your grave and your mother. And what Solomon spoke of others will suit you also; for he said, in that case, <em>There is a time to bear and a time to die</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312405"><a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse2">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;3:2</a></span>; but to you, in the reverse order, there was a time to die and a time to be born; and one and the same time effected both of these, and your birth went hand in hand with your death.</p>

<p>5. O strange and inconceivable thing! We did not really die, we were not really buried, we were not really crucified and raised again; but our imitation was in a figure, and our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in reality. Christ was actually crucified, and actually buried, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> rose again; and all these things He has freely bestowed upon us, that we, sharing His sufferings by imitation, might gain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in reality. O surpassing loving-kindness! Christ received nails in His undefiled hands and feet, and suffered anguish; while on me without pain or toil by the fellowship of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> He freely bestows <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>6. Let no one then suppose that Baptism is merely the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or further, that of adoption; as John's was a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>  conferring only remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: whereas we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> full well, that as it purges our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and ministers  to us the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so also it is the counterpart  of the sufferings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> just now cried aloud and said, <em>Or are you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that all we who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into His death? We were buried therefore with Him by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> into His death</em>.  These words he spoke to some who were disposed to think that Baptism ministers to us the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and adoption, but has not further the fellowship also, by representation, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sufferings.</p>

<p>7. In order therefore that we might learn, that whatsoever things Christ endured, for us and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>  He suffered them in reality and not in appearance, and that we also are made partakers of His sufferings, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> cried with all exactness of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <em>For if we have been planted together with the likeness of His death, we shall be also with the likeness of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a></em>. Well has he said, <em>planted together</em>.  For since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Vine was planted in this place, we also by partaking in the Baptism of death have been <em>planted together</em> with Him. And fix your mind with much attention on the words of the Apostle. He said not, <q>For if we have been planted together with His death,</q> but, <em>with the likeness of His death</em>. For in Christ's case there was death in reality, for His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was really separated from His body, and real burial, for His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body was wrapt in pure linen; and everything happened really to Him; but in your case there was only a likeness of death and sufferings, whereas of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> there was not a likeness but a reality.</p>

<p>8. Having been sufficiently instructed in these things, keep them, I beseech you, in your remembrance; that I also, unworthy though I be, may say of you, <em>Now I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you</em> , <em>because ye always remember me, and hold fast the traditions, which I delivered unto you</em>. And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has presented you <em>as it were alive from the dead</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312413"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;6:13</a></span>, is able to grant unto you <em>to walk in newness of life</em> : because His is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the power, now and for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
