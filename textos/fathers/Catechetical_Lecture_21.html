<h1>Catechetical Lecture 21</h1>

<p><strong>(On the Mysteries. III.)</strong></p>

<p><strong>On Chrism.</strong></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse20">1 John 2:20-28</a></p>

<p>But you have an unction from the Holy One, etc.....that, when He shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before Him at His coming.</p>

<p>1. Having been <em><a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ</em>, and <em>put on Christ <span class="stiki" id="note312415"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians&nbsp;3:27</a></span> </em>, you have been made conformable to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; for God having <em>foreordained us unto adoption as sons <span class="stiki" id="note312416"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;1:5</a></span> </em>, made us <em>to be conformed to the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312417"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;3:21</a></span> Having therefore become <em>partakers of Christ</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312418"><a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;3:14</a></span>, you are properly called Christs, and of you God said, <em>Touch not My Christs</em> , or anointed. Now you have been made Christs, by receiving the antitype  of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and all things have been wrought in you by imitation , because you are images of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He washed in the river Jordan, and having imparted of the fragrance  of His Godhead to the waters, He came up from them; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the fullness of His being  lighted on Him, like resting upon like.  And to you in like manner, after you had come up from the pool of the sacred streams, there was given an Unction , the anti-type of that wherewith Christ was anointed; and this is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; of whom also the blessed Esaias, in his <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> respecting Him, said in the person of the Lord, <em>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon Me, because He has anointed Me: He has sent Me to preach glad tidings to the poor</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312426"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;61:1</a></span> .</p>

<p>2. For Christ was not anointed by men with oil or material ointment, but the Father having before appointed Him to be the Saviour of the whole world, anointed Him with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as Peter says, <em><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, whom God anointed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312427"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse38">Acts&nbsp;10:38</a></span> David also the Prophet cried, saying, <em>Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Your kingdom; You have loved righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity; therefore God even Your God has anointed You with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above Your fellows</em>.  And as Christ was in reality crucified, and buried, and raised, and you are in Baptism accounted worthy of being crucified, buried, and raised together with Him in a likeness, so is it with the unction also. As He was anointed with an ideal  oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, that is, with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, called oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, because He is the author of spiritual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, so you were anointed with ointment, having been made partakers and <em>fellows of Christ</em>.</p>

<p>3. But beware of supposing this to be plain ointment. For as the Bread of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, after the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is mere bread no longer , but the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so also this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ointment is no more simple ointment, nor (so to say) common, after invocation, but it is Christ's gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and, by the advent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is made fit to impart His Divine Nature.  Which ointment is <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolically</a> applied to your forehead and your other senses ; and while your body is anointed with the visible ointment, your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sanctified by the Holy and life-giving Spirit.</p>

<p>4. And you were first anointed on the forehead, that you might be delivered from the shame, which the first man who transgressed bore about with him everywhere; and that <em>with unveiled face ye might reflect as a mirror the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312433"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:18</a></span> Then on your ears; that you might receive the ears which are quick to hear the Divine Mysteries, of which Esaias said, <em>The Lord gave me also an ear to hear</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312434"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;50:4</a></span>; and the Lord Jesus in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <em>He that has ears to hear let him hear</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312435"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;11:15</a></span> Then on the nostrils; that receiving the sacred ointment ye may say, <em>We are to God a sweet savour of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in them that are saved</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312436"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> Afterwards on your breast; that having put on the <em>breast-plate of righteousness</em>, you may <em>stand against the wiles of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a></em>.  For as Christ after His Baptism, and the visitation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, went forth and vanquished the adversary, so likewise ye, after Holy Baptism and the Mystical Chrism, having put on the whole armour of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, are to stand against the power of the adversary, and vanquish it, saying, <em>I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312438"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> .</p>

<p>5. Having been counted worthy of this Holy Chrism, you are called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, verifying the name also by your new birth. For before you were deemed worthy of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, you had properly no right to this title, but were advancing on your way towards being <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</p>

<p>6. Moreover, you should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in the old Scripture there lies the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of this Chrism. For what time <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> imparted to his brother the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and made him High-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, after bathing in water, he anointed him; and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> was called Christ or Anointed, evidently from the typical Chrism. So also the High-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in advancing Solomon to the kingdom, anointed him after he had bathed in Gihon. <span class="stiki" id="note312439"><a href="../bible/1ki001.htm#verse39">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;1:39</a></span> To them however these things happened in a figure, but to you not in a figure, but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; because you were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> anointed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Christ is the beginning of your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; for He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the First-fruit, and you the mass <span class="stiki" id="note312440"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;11:16</a></span>; but if the First-fruit be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, it is manifest that Its <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> will pass to the mass also.</p>

<p>7. Keep This unspotted: for it shall teach you all things, if it abide in you, as you have just heard declared by the blessed John, discoursing much concerning this Unction.  For this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing is a spiritual safeguard of the body, and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Of this the blessed Esaias prophesying of old time said, <em>And on this mountain</em>,&mdash; (now he calls the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a mountain elsewhere also, as when he says, <em>In the last days the mountain of the Lord's house shall be manifest</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312442"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;2:2</a></span>;)&mdash; <em>on this mountain shall the Lord make unto all nations a feast; they shall drink wine, they shall drink <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, they shall anoint themselves with ointment</em>.  And that he may make you sure, hear what he says of this ointment as being mystical; <em>Deliver all these things to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, for the counsel of the Lord is unto all nations</em>.  Having been anointed, therefore, with this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ointment, keep it unspotted and unblemished in you, pressing forward by good works, and being made well-pleasing to the Captain of your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
