<h1>Catechetical Lecture 22</h1>

<p><strong>(On the Mysteries. IV.)</strong></p>

<p><strong>On the Body and Blood of Christ.</strong></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse23">1 Corinthians 11:23</a></p>

<p>I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, how that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, in the night in which He was betrayed, took bread, etc.</p>

<p>1. Even of itself  the teaching of the Blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is sufficient to give you a full assurance concerning those Divine Mysteries, of which having been deemed worthy, you have become of <em>the same body</em>  and blood with Christ. For you have just heard him say distinctly, <em>That <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> in the night in which He was betrayed, took bread, and when He had given thanks He broke it, and gave to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, saying, Take, eat, this is My Body: and having taken the cup and given thanks, He said, Take, drink, this is My Blood</em>.  Since then He Himself declared and said of the Bread, <em>This is My Body</em>, who shall dare to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> any longer? And since He has Himself affirmed and said, <em>This is My Blood</em>, who shall ever hesitate, saying, that it is not His blood?</p>

<p>2. He once in <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, turned the water into wine, akin to blood , and is it incredible that He should have turned wine into blood? When called to a bodily marriage, He miraculously wrought  that wonderful work; and <em>on the children of the bride-chamber</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312450"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;9:15</a></span>, shall He not much rather be acknowledged to have bestowed the fruition of His Body and Blood ?</p>

<p>3. Wherefore with full assurance let us partake as of the Body and Blood of Christ: for in the figure  of Bread is given to you His Body, and in the figure of Wine His Blood; that you by partaking of the Body and Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, may be made of the same body and the same blood with Him. For thus we come to bear Christ  in us, because His Body and Blood are distributed  through our members; thus it is that, according to the blessed Peter, <em>we become partakers of the divine nature</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312455"><a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:4</a></span> .</p>

<p>4. Christ on a certain occasion discoursing with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said, <em>Except you eat My flesh and drink My blood, you have no life in you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312456"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse53">John&nbsp;6:53</a></span> They not having heard His saying in a spiritual sense were offended, and went back, supposing that He was inviting them to eat flesh.</p>

<p>5. In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> also there was <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">show-bread</a>; but this, as it belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, has come to an end; but in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> there is Bread of heaven, and a Cup of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, sanctifying <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; for as the Bread corresponds to our body, so is the Word  appropriate to our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>6. Consider therefore the Bread and the Wine not as bare elements, for they are, according to the Lord's declaration, the Body and Blood of Christ; for even though sense suggests this to you, yet let <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> establish you. Judge not the matter from the taste, but from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be fully assured without misgiving, that the Body and Blood of Christ have been vouchsafed to you.</p>

<p>7. Also the blessed David shall advise you the meaning of this, saying, <em>You have prepared a table before me in the presence of them that afflict me</em>.  What he says, is to this effect: Before Your coming, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> prepared a table for men , polluted and defiled and full of devilish influence ; but since Your coming. O Lord, <em>You have prepared a table before me</em>. When the man says to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>You have prepared before me a table</em>, what other does he indicate but that mystical and spiritual Table, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has prepared for us <em>over against</em>, that is, contrary and in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>? And very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>; for that had communion with devils, but this, with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <em>You have anointed my head with oil</em>.  With oil He anointed your head upon your forehead, for the seal which you have of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that you may be made <em>the engraving of the signet, Holiness unto God</em>.  And <em>your cup intoxicates me, as very strong</em>.  You see that cup here spoken of, which Jesus took in His hands, and gave thanks, and said, <em>This is My blood, which is shed for many for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312464"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;26:28</a></span> .</p>

<p>8. Therefore Solomon also, hinting at this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, says in Ecclesiastes, <em>Come hither, eat your bread with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a></em> (that is, the spiritual bread; <em>Come hither</em>, he calls with the call to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and blessing), <em>and drink your wine with a merry heart</em> (that is, the spiritual wine); <em>and let oil be poured out upon your head</em> you see he alludes even to the mystic Chrism); <em>and let your garments be always white, for the Lord is well pleased with your works</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312465"><a href="../bible/ecc009.htm#verse7">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;9:7-8</a></span>; for before you came to Baptism, your works were <em>vanity of vanities</em>.  But now, having put off your old garments, and put on those which are spiritually white, you must be continually robed in white: of course we mean not this, that you are always to wear white raiment; but you must be clad in the garments that are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> white and shining and spiritual, that you may say with the blessed Esaias, <em>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be joyful in my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for He has clothed me with a garment of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and put a robe of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> around me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312467"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;61:10</a></span> .</p>

<p>9. Having learned these things, and been fully assured that the seeming bread is not bread, though sensible to taste, but the Body of Christ; and that the seeming wine is not wine, though the taste will have it so, but the Blood of Christ ; and that of this David sung of old, saying, <em>And bread strengthens man's heart, to make his face to shine with oil</em> , <q>strengthen your heart,</q> by partaking thereof as spiritual, and <q>make the face of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to shine.</q> And so having it unveiled with a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, may you <em>reflect as a mirror the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312470"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:18</a></span>, and proceed from <em><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></em>, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>:&mdash; To whom be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and might, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
