<h1>Catechetical Lecture 23</h1>

<p><strong>(On the Mysteries. V.)</strong></p>

<p><strong>On the Sacred Liturgy and Communion. </strong></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse1">1 Peter 2:1</a></p>

<p> <em>Wherefore putting away all filthiness, and all guile, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speaking</em>  <em>, etc.</em></p>

<p>1. By the loving-kindness of God you have heard sufficiently at our former meetings concerning Baptism, and Chrism, and partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ; and now it is necessary to pass on to what is next in order, meaning today to set the crown on the spiritual building of your edification.</p>

<p>2. You have seen then the Deacon who gives to the Priest water to wash , and to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> who stand round God's altar. He gave it not at all because of bodily defilement; it is not that; for we did not enter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at first  with defiled bodies. But the washing of hands is a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> that you ought to be pure from all sinful and unlawful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; for since the hands are a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of action, by washing  them, it is evident, we represent the purity and blamelessness of our conduct. Did you not hear the blessed David opening this very <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, and saying, <em>I will wash my hands in innocency, and so will compass Your Altar, O Lord</em> ? The washing therefore of hands is a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of immunity  from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>3. Then the Deacon cries aloud, <q>Receive ye one another; and let us <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> one another. </q> Think not that this <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> is of the same character with those given in public by common friends. It is not such: but this <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> blends <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> one with another, and courts entire forgiveness for them. The <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> therefore is the sign that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are mingled together, and banish all remembrance of wrongs. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> Christ said, <em>If you are offering your gift at the altar, and there rememberest that your brother has anything against time, leave there your gift upon the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift</em>.  The <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> therefore is reconciliation, and for this reason <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>: as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> somewhere cried, saying, <em>Greet ye one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312480"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;16:20</a></span>; and Peter, <em>with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of charity</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312481"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:15</a></span> .</p>

<p>4. After this the Priest cries aloud, <q>Lift up your hearts. </q> For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> ought we in that most awful hour to have our heart on high with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not below, thinking of earth and earthly things. In effect therefore the Priest bids all in that hour to dismiss all cares of this life, or household anxieties, and to have their heart in heaven with the merciful God. Then ye answer, <q>We lift them up unto the Lord:</q> assenting to it, by your avowal. But let no one come here, who could say with his mouth, <q>We lift up our hearts unto the Lord,</q> but in his thoughts have his mind concerned with the cares of this life. At all times, rather, God should be in our memory but if this is impossible by reason of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, in that hour above all this should be our earnest endeavour.</p>

<p>5. Then the Priest says, <q>Let us give thanks unto the Lord.</q> For verily we are bound to give thanks, that He called us, unworthy as we were, to so great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; that He reconciled us when we were His foes; that He vouchsafed to us the Spirit of adoption. Then ye say, <q>It is meet and right:</q> for in giving thanks we do a meet thing and a right; but He did not right, but more than right, in doing us good, and counting us meet for such great benefits.</p>

<p>6. After this, we make mention of heaven, and earth, and sea ; of sun and moon; of stars and all the creation, rational and irrational, visible and invisible; of Angels, Archangels, Virtues, Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Thrones; of the Cherubim with many faces: in effect repeating that call of David's <em>Magnify the Lord with me</em>.  We make mention also of the Seraphim, whom Esaias in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> saw standing around the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with two of their wings veiling their face, and with two their feet, while with two they did fly, crying <em>Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Sabaoth</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note312485"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;6:2-3</a></span> For the reason of our reciting this confession of God , delivered down to us from the Seraphim, is this, that so we may be partakers with the hosts of the world above in their Hymn of praise.</p>

<p>7. Then having sanctified ourselves by these spiritual Hymns, we beseech the merciful God to send forth His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> upon the gifts lying before Him; that He may make the Bread the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the Wine the Blood of Christ ; for whatsoever the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has touched, is surely sanctified and changed.</p>

<p>8. Then, after the spiritual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, the bloodless service, is completed, over that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of propitiation  we entreat God for the common peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, for the welfare of the world ; for kings; for soldiers and allies; for the sick; for the afflicted; and, in a word, for all who stand in need of succour we all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and offer this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</p>

<p>9. Then we commemorate also those who have fallen asleep before us, first Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, that at their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and intercessions God would receive our petition.  Then on behalf also of the Holy Fathers and Bishops who have fallen asleep before us, and in a word of all who in past years have fallen asleep among us, believing that it will be a very great benefit to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> , for whom the supplication is put up, while that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most awful <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is set forth.</p>

<p>10. And I wish to persuade you by an illustration. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many say, what is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> profited, which departs from this world either with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if it be commemorated in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>? For if a king were to banish certain who had given him offense, and then those who belong to them  should weave a crown and offer it to him on behalf of those under punishment, would he not grant a remission of their penalties? In the same way we, when we offer to Him our supplications for those who have fallen asleep, though they be sinners, weave no crown, but offer up Christ <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> , propitiating our merciful God for them as well as for ourselves.</p>

<p>11. Then, after these things, we say that Prayer which the Saviour delivered to His own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, with a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> entitling God our Father, and saying, <em>Our Father, which art in heaven</em>. O most surpassing loving-kindness of God! On them who revolted from Him and were in the very extreme of misery has He bestowed such a complete forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, and so great participation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as that they should even call Him Father. <em>Our Father, which art in heaven</em>; and they also are a heaven who <em>bear the image of the heavenly</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312494"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse49">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:49</a></span>, in whom is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>dwelling and walking in them</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312495"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:16</a></span> .</p>

<p>12. <em>Hallowed be Your Name</em>. The Name of God is in its nature <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, whether we say so or not; but since it is sometimes profaned among sinners, according to the words, <em>Through you My Name is continually <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a></em> , we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that in us God's Name may be hallowed; not that it comes to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> from not being <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, but because it becomes <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in us, when we are made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and do things worthy of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</p>

<p>13. <em>Your kingdom come</em>. A pure <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can say with boldness, <em>Your kingdom come</em>; for he who has heard <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> saying, <em>Let not therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> reign in your mortal body</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312497"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;6:12</a></span>, and has cleansed himself in deed, and thought, and word, will say to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>Your kingdom come</em>.</p>

<p>14. <em>Your will be done as in heaven so on earth</em>. God's divine and blessed Angels do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as David said in the Psalm, <em>Bless the Lord, all you Angels of His, mighty in strength, that do His pleasure</em>.  So then in effect you mean this by your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>as in the Angels Your will is done, so likewise be it done on earth in me, O Lord.</q></p>

<p>15. <em>Give us this day our substantial bread</em>. This common bread is not substantial bread, but this Holy Bread is substantial, that is, appointed for the substance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  For this Bread <em>goes</em> not <em>into the belly and is cast out into the draught</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312500"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;15:17</a></span>, but is distributed into your whole system for the benefit of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  But by <em>this day</em>, he means, <q>each day,</q> as also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, <em>While it is called today</em> <span class="stiki" id="note312502"><a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse15">Hebrews&nbsp;3:15</a></span> .</p>

<p>16. <em>And forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors</em>. For we have many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For we offend both in word and in thought, and very many things we do worthy of condemnation; and <em>if we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em>, we lie, as John says.  And we make a covenant with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, entreating Him to forgive us our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as we also forgive our neighbours their debts. Considering then what we receive and in return for what, let us not put off nor delay to forgive one another. The offenses committed against us are slight and trivial, and easily settled; but those which we have committed against God are great, and need such mercy as His only is. Take heed therefore, lest for the slight and trivial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against you, you shut out for yourself forgiveness from God for your very grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>17. <em>And lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, O Lord</em>. Is this then what the Lord teaches us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, that we may not be tempted at all? How then is it said elsewhere, <q>a man untempted, is a man unproved ;</q> and again, <em>My brethren, count it all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> when you fall into various <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312505"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse2">James&nbsp;1:2</a></span>? But does perchance the entering into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> mean the being overwhelmed by the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>? For <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is, as it were, like a winter torrent difficult to cross. Those therefore who are not overwhelmed in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, pass through, showing themselves excellent swimmers, and not being swept away by them at all; while those who are not such, enter into them and are overwhelmed. As for example, Judas having entered into the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, swam not through it, but was overwhelmed and was strangled  both in body and spirit. Peter entered into the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of the denial; but having entered, he was not overwhelmed by it, but manfully swam through it, and was delivered from the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.  Listen again, in another place, to a company of unscathed <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, giving thanks for deliverance from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, <em>You, O God hast <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> us; You have tried us by fire like as silver is tried. You brought us into the net; You layed afflictions upon our loins. You have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and water; and you brought us out into a place of rest</em>.  You see them speaking boldly in regard to their having passed through and not been pierced.  <em>But You brought us out into a place of rest</em>; now their coming into a place of rest is their being delivered from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</p>

<p>18. <em>But deliver us from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></em>. If <em>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a></em> implied the not being tempted at all, He would not have said, <em>But deliver us from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></em>. Now <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is our adversary the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, from whom we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to be delivered.  Then after completing the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> you say <em><a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a></em> ; by this <em><a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a></em>, which means <q>So be it,</q> setting your seal to the petitions of the divinely-taught <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<p>19. After this the Priest says, <q>Holy things to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men.</q> Holy are the gifts presented, having received the visitation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> are you also, having been deemed worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things therefore correspond to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.  Then ye say, <q>One is Holy, One is the Lord, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. </q> For One is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, by nature <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; we too are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, but not by nature, only by participation, and discipline, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<p>20. After this ye hear the chanter inviting you with a sacred melody to the communion of the Holy Mysteries, and saying, <em>O taste and see that the Lord is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a></em>.  Trust not the judgment to your bodily palate  no, but to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfaltering; for they who taste are bidden to taste, not bread and wine, but the anti-typical  Body and Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>21. In approaching  therefore, come not with your wrists extended, or your fingers spread; but make your left hand a throne for the right, as for that which is to receive a King.  And having hollowed your palm, receive the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, saying over it, <em><a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a></em>. So then after having carefully hallowed your eyes by the touch of the Holy Body, partake of it; giving heed lest you lose any portion thereof ; for whatever you lose, is evidently a loss to you as it were from one of your own members. For tell me, if any one gave you grains of gold, would you not hold them with all carefulness, being on your guard against losing any of them, and suffering loss? Will you not then much more carefully keep watch, that not a crumb fall from you of what is more precious than gold and precious stones?</p>

<p>22. Then after you have partaken of the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, draw near also to the Cup of His Blood; not stretching forth your hands, but bending , and saying with an air of worship and reverence, <em><a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a></em> , hallow yourself by partaking also of the Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And while the moisture is still upon your lips, touch it with your hands, and hallow your eyes and brow and the other organs of sense.  Then wait for the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and give thanks unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has accounted you worthy of so great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. </p>

<p>23. Hold fast these traditions undefiled and, keep yourselves free from offense. Sever not yourselves from the Communion; deprive not yourselves, through the pollution of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, of these Holy and Spiritual Mysteries. <em>And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit, and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and body be preserved entire without blame at the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note312524"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:23</a></span>:&mdash; To whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and might, with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
