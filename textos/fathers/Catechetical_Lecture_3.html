<p><strong>On Baptism.</strong></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Romans 6:3-4</p>

<p>Or do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all we who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ Jesus were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into His death? Were buried therefore with Him by our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> into death, etc.</p>

<p>1. <em>Rejoice, you heavens, and let the earth be glad</em> , for those who are to be sprinkled with <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a>, and cleansed with the spiritual  <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a>, the power of Him to whom at His Passion drink was offered on <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a> and a reed.  And while the Heavenly Powers <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, let the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are to be united to the spiritual Bridegroom make themselves ready. For <em>the voice</em> is heard <em>of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310569"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;40:3</a></span> For this is no light matter, no ordinary and indiscriminate union according to the flesh , but the All-searching Spirit's election according to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For the inter-marriages and contracts of the world are not made altogether with judgment: but wherever there is <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> or beauty, there the bridegroom speedily approves: but here it is not beauty of person, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> clear <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; not the condemned Mammon, but the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in godliness.</p>

<p>2. Listen then, O you children of righteousness, to John's exhortation when he says, <em>Make straight the way of the Lord</em>. Take away all obstacles and stumbling-blocks, that you may walk straight onward to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Make ready the vessels  of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, cleansed by unfeigned <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for reception of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Begin at once to wash your robes in repentance, that when called to the bride-chamber you may be found clean. For the Bridegroom invites all without distinction, because His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is bounteous; and the cry of loud-voiced heralds assembles them all: but the same Bridegroom afterwards separates those who have come in to the figurative marriage. O may none of those whose names have now been enrolled hear the words, <em>Friend, how did you come in hither, not having a wedding garment</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310572"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;22:12</a></span>? But may you all hear, <em>Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things: enter thou into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of your lord</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310573"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;25:12</a></span> .</p>

<p>For now meanwhile you stand outside the door: but God grant that you all may say, <em>The King has brought me into His chamber</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310574"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse4">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;1:4</a></span> <em>Let my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord: for He has clothed me with a garment of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and a robe of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>: He has crowned me with a garland as a bridegroom</em> , <em>and decked me with ornaments as a bride</em>: that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of every one of you may be found <em>not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310576"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse7">Ephesians&nbsp;5:7</a></span>; I do not mean before you have received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for how could that be? Since it is for remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that you have been called; but that, when the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is to be given, your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> being found uncondemned may concur with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>3. This is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> a serious matter, brethren, and you must approach it with good heed. Each one of you is about to be presented to God before tens of thousands of the Angelic Hosts: the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is about to seal  your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: you are to be enrolled in the army of the Great King. Therefore make you ready, and equip yourselves, by putting on I mean, not bright apparel , but <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Regard not the Laver as simple water, but rather regard the spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that is given with the water. For just as the offerings brought to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> altars , though simple in their nature, become defiled by the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> , so contrariwise the simple water having received the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, acquires a new power of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</p>

<p>4. For since man is of twofold <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, the purification also is twofold, the one incorporeal for the incorporeal part, and the other bodily for the body: the water cleanses the body, and the Spirit seals the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; that we may draw near unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>having our heart sprinkled</em> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, <em>and our body washed with pure water</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310581"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse22">Hebrews&nbsp;10:22</a></span> When going down, therefore, into the water, think not of the bare element, but look for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: for without both you can not possibly be made perfect.  It is not I that say this, but the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who has the power in this matter: for He says, <em>Unless a man be born anew</em> (and He adds the words) <em>of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310583"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;3:3</a></span> Neither does he that is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water, but not found worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in perfection; nor if a man be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> in his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but receive not the seal by water, shall he enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. A bold saying, but not mine, for it is Jesus who has declared it: and here is the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the statement from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. Cornelius was a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, who was honoured with a vision of Angels, and had set up his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> as a good memorial  before God in heaven. Peter came, and the Spirit was poured out upon them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and they spoke with other tongues, and prophesied: and after the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that Peter <em>commanded them to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note310585"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse48">Acts&nbsp;10:48</a></span>; in order that, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> having been born again by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> , the body also might by the water partake of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>5. But if any one wishes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> why the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given by water and not by a different element, let him take up the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> and he shall learn. For water is a grand thing, and the noblest of the four visible elements of the world. <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is the dwelling-place of Angels, but the heavens are from the waters : the earth is the place of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but the earth is from the waters: and before the whole six days' formation of the things that were made, <em>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> moved upon the face of the water</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310588"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;1:2</a></span> The water was the beginning of the world, and Jordan the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> tidings: for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> deliverance from <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> was through the sea, and for the world deliverance from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <em>by the washing of water with the word</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310589"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse26">Ephesians&nbsp;5:26</a></span> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Where a covenant is made with any, there is water also. After the flood, a covenant was made with <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>: a covenant for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from Mount Sinai, but <em>with water, and scarlet wool, and <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310590"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse19">Hebrews&nbsp;9:19</a></span> Elias is taken up, but not apart from water: for first he crosses the Jordan, then in a chariot mounts the heaven. The high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is first washed, then offers <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>; for <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> first washed, then was made high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: for how could one who had not yet been purified by water <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the rest? Also as a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of Baptism there was a laver set apart within the Tabernacle.</p>

<p>6. Baptism is the end of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and beginning of the New. For its author was John, than whom was <em>none greater among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a></em>. The end he was of the Prophets: <em>for all the Prophets and the law were until John</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310591"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;11:13</a></span>: but of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> history he was the first-fruit. For it says, <em>The beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, etc.</em>: <em>John came baptising in the wilderness</em>.  You may mention Elias the Tishbite who was taken up into heaven, yet he is not greater than John: <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> was translated, but he is not greater than John: <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was a very great lawgiver, and all the Prophets were admirable, but not greater than John. It is not I that dare to compare Prophets with Prophets: but their Master and ours, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, declared it: <em>Among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> there has not risen a greater than John</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310593"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;11:11</a></span>: He says not <q>among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>,</q> but <em>of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a></em>.  The comparison is between the great servant and his fellow-servants: but the pre-eminence and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Son is beyond comparison with servants. Do you see how great a man God chose as the first minister of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>?&mdash; a man possessing nothing, and a lover of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, yet no hater of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>: who ate locusts, and winged his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for heaven : feeding upon honey, and speaking things both sweeter and more salutary than honey: clothed with a garment of camel's hair, and showing in himself the pattern of the <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> life; who also was sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> while yet he was carried in his mother's womb. Jeremiah was sanctified, but did not prophesy, in the womb <span class="stiki" id="note310596"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:5</a></span>: John alone while carried in the womb leaped for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> <span class="stiki" id="note310597"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;1:44</a></span>, and though he saw not with the eyes of flesh, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his Master by the Spirit: for since the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Baptism was great, it required greatness in its founder also.</p>

<p>7. This man was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> in Jordan, and <em>there went out unto him all Jerusalem</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310598"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;3:5</a></span>, to enjoy the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of baptisms: for in Jerusalem is the prerogative of all things good. But learn, O you inhabitants of Jerusalem, how they that came out were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him: <em>confessing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em>, it is said. <span class="stiki" id="note310599"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;3:6</a></span> First they showed their wounds, then he applied the remedies, and to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> gave redemption from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>. And if you will be convinced of this very point, that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John is a redemption from the threat of the fire, hear how he says, <em>O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> to come</em>  <em>? Be not then henceforth a viper, but as you have been formerly a viper's brood, put off, says he, the slough</em>  <em>of your former sinful life. For every serpent creeps into a hole and casts its old slough, and having rubbed off the old skin, grows young again in body. In like manner enter thou also through the strait and narrow gate</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310602"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;7:13-14</a></span>: rub off your former self by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and drive out that which is destroying you. <em>Put off the old man with his doings</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310603"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse9">Colossians&nbsp;3:9</a></span>, and quote that saying in the Canticles, <em>I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on</em> ?</p>

<p>But there is perhaps among you some hypocrite, a man-pleaser, and one who makes a pretence of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, but believes not from the heart; having the hypocrisy of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>; one who has come hither not in order to receive of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but to spy out what is given: let him also learn from John: <em>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees, Every tree therefore that brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310605"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;3:10</a></span> The Judge is inexorable; put away your hypocrisy.</p>

<p>8. What then must you do? And what are the fruits of repentance? <em>Let him that has two coats give to him that has none</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310606"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;3:11</a></span>: the teacher was worthy of credit, since he was also the first to practise what he taught: he was not ashamed to speak, for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> hindered not his tongue: <em>and he that has meat, let him do likewise</em>. Would you enjoy the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, yet judgest the poor not worthy of bodily food? Seekest thou the great gifts, and impartest not of the small? Though you be a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, or a fornicator, have hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: <em>the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310607"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;21:31</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, saying, <em>Neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor</em> the rest, <em>shall inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. And such were some of you: but you were washed, but you were sanctified</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310608"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:9-10</a></span> He said not, <em>such are some of you</em>, but <em>such were some of you</em>. Sin committed in the state of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is pardoned, but persistent <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is condemned.</p>

<p>9. You have as the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Baptism the Son Himself, the Only-begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For why should I speak any more of man? John was great, but what is he to the Lord? His was a loud-sounding voice, but what in comparison with the Word? Very noble was the herald, but what in comparison with the King? Noble was he that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water, but what to Him that baptizes <em>with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and with fire</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310609"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;3:11</a></span>? The Saviour <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the Apostles with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and with fire, when <em>suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire: and it sat upon each one of them, and they were all filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note310610"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;2:2</a></span> .</p>

<p>10. If any man receive not Baptism, he has not <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; except only Martyrs, who even without the water receive the kingdom. For when the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, in redeeming the world by His Cross, was pierced in the side, He shed forth blood and water; that men, living in times of peace, might be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in water, and, in times of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, in their own blood. For <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> also the Saviour is wont to call a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, saying, <em>Can you drink the cup which I drink, and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> that I am <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310611"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse38">Mark&nbsp;10:38</a></span>? And the Martyrs confess, by <em>being made a spectacle unto the world, and to Angels, and to men</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310612"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:9</a></span>; and you will soon confess:&mdash; but it is not yet the time for you to hear of this.</p>

<p>11. Jesus sanctified Baptism by being Himself <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. If the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, what godly man is he that despises Baptism? But He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> not that He might receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for He was sinless; but being sinless, He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that He might give to them that are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> a divine and excellent <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For <em>since the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise partook of the same</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310613"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;2:14</a></span>, that having been made partakers of His presence in the flesh we might be made partakers also of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>: thus Jesus was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that thereby we again by our participation might receive both <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. According to Job, there was in the waters the dragon that <em>draws up Jordan into his mouth</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310614"><a href="../bible/job040.htm#verse23">Job&nbsp;40:23</a></span> Since, therefore, it was necessary to break the heads of the dragon in pieces , He went down and bound the strong one in the waters, that we might receive power to <em>tread upon serpents and scorpions</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310616"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;10:19</a></span> The beast was great and terrible. <em>No fishing-vessel was able to carry one scale of his tail</em> : destruction ran before him , ravaging all that met him. The Life encountered him, that the mouth of Death might henceforth be stopped, and all we that are saved might say, <em>O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310619"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse55">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:55</a></span>? The sting of death is drawn by Baptism.</p>

<p>12. For you go down into the water, bearing your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but the invocation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> , having sealed your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, suffers you not afterwards to be swallowed up by the terrible dragon. Having gone down dead in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, you come up quickened in righteousness. For if you have been <em>united with the likeness of the Saviour's death</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310621"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;6:5</a></span>, you shall also be deemed worthy of His Resurrection. For as Jesus took upon Him the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the world, and died, that by putting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to death He might rise again in righteousness; so thou by going down into the water, and being in a manner buried in the waters, as He was in the rock, art raised again <em>walking in newness of life</em>. </p>

<p>13. Moreover, when you have been deemed worthy of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, He then gives you strength to wrestle against the adverse powers. For as after His Baptism He was tempted forty days (not that He was unable to gain the victory before, but because He wished to do all things in due order and succession), so thou likewise, though not daring before your <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to wrestle with the adversaries, yet after you have received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and art henceforth confident in <em>the armour of righteousness</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310623"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:7</a></span>, must then do battle, and preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, if you will.</p>

<p>14. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, yet He preached not the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> before His Baptism. If the Master Himself followed the right time in due order, ought we, His servants, to venture out of order? <em>From that time Jesus began to preach <span class="stiki" id="note310624"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;4:17</a></span> </em>, when <em>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had descended upon Him in a bodily shape, like a dove</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310625"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;3:22</a></span>; not that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> might see Him first, for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him even before He came in a bodily shape, but that John, who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> Him, might behold Him. For <em>I</em>, says he, <em><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not: but He that sent me to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with water, He said unto me, Upon whomsoever you shall see the Spirit descending and abiding on Him, that is He</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310626"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;1:33</a></span> If you too hast unfeigned <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> comes down on you also, and a Father's voice sounds over you from on high&mdash; not, <q> <em>This is My Son</em>,</q> but, <q>This has now been made My son;</q> for the <q> <em>is</em></q> belongs to Him alone, because <em>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God</em>.  To Him belongs the <q> <em>is</em>,</q> since He is always the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: but to you <q>has now been made:</q> since you have not the sonship by nature, but   receive it by adoption. He <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> <q> <em>is</em>;</q> but you receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by advancement.</p>

<p>15. Make ready then the vessel of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that you may become a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, and <em>an heir of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and joint-heir with Christ</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310628"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;8:17</a></span>; if, indeed, you are preparing yourself that you may receive; if you are drawing near in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that you may be made faithful; if of set purpose you are putting off the old man. For all things whatsoever you have done shall be forgiven you, whether it be fornication, or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or any other such form of licentiousness. What can be a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than to crucify Christ? Yet even of this Baptism can purify. For so spoke Peter to the three thousand who came to him, to those who had crucified the Lord, when they asked him, saying, <em>Men and brethren, what shall we do</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310629"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse37">Acts&nbsp;2:37</a></span>? For the wound is great. You have made us think of our fall, O Peter, by saying, <em>You killed the Prince of Life</em>.  What salve is there for so great a wound? What cleansing for such foulness? What is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for such perdition? <em>Repent</em>, says he, <em>and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> every one of you in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and you shall receive the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></em>.  O unspeakable loving-kindness of God! They have no hope of being saved, and yet they are thought worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. You see the power of Baptism! If any of you has crucified the Christ by <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> words; if any of you in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> has denied Him before men; if any by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> works has caused the doctrine to be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>; let him repent and be of good hope, for the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is present even now.</p>

<p>16. <em>Be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, O Jerusalem; the Lord will take away all your iniquities</em>.  <em>The Lord will wash away the filth of His sons and of His daughters by the Spirit of judgment, and by the Spirit of burning</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310633"><a href="../bible/isa004.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;4:4</a></span> . <em> He will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be cleansed from all your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310634"><a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse25">Ezekiel&nbsp;36:25</a></span> Angels shall dance around you, and say, Who is this that comes up in white array, leaning upon her beloved ? For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that was formerly a slave has now adopted her Master Himself as her kinsman: and He accepting the unfeigned purpose will answer: <em>Behold, you are fair, my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; behold, you are fair: your teeth are like flocks of sheep new shorn</em>, (because of the confession of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>: and further) <em>which have all of them twins</em> ; because of the twofold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, I mean that which is perfected of water and of the Spirit , or that which is announced by the Old and by the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. And God grant that all of you when you have finished the course of the fast, may remember what I say, and bringing forth fruit in good works, may stand blameless beside the Spiritual Bridegroom, and obtain the remission of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to whom with the Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
