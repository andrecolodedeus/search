<h1>Catechetical Lecture 5</h1>

<p><strong>Of Faith.</strong></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Hebrews 11:1, 2</p>

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report.</p>

<p>1. How great a dignity the Lord bestows on you in transferring you from the order of Catechumens to that of the Faithful, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> shows, when he affirms, <em>God is faithful, by Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310755"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:9</a></span> For since God is called Faithful, thou also in receiving this title   receive a great dignity. For as God is called Good, and Just, and Almighty, and Maker of the Universe, so is He also called Faithful. Consider therefore to what a dignity you are rising, seeing you are to become partaker of a title of God. </p>

<p>2. Here then it is further required, that each of you be found faithful in his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>: <em>for a faithful man it is hard to find</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310757"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse6">Proverbs&nbsp;20:6</a></span>: not that you should show your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to me, for you are not to <em>be judged of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> judgment</em> ; but that thou show the sincerity of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>who tries the reins and hearts</em> , and <em><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the thoughts of men</em>.  A great thing is a faithful man, being richest of all rich men. For <em>to the faithful man belongs the whole world of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a></em> , in that he disdains and tramples on it. For they who in appearance are rich, and have many possessions, are poor in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: since the more they gather, the more they pine with longing for what is still lacking. But the faithful man, most strange paradox, in poverty is rich: for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that we need only to have <em>food and raiment</em>, and being <em>therewith content</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310762"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:8</a></span>, he has trodden riches under foot.</p>

<p>3. Nor is it only among us, who bear the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that the dignity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is great : but likewise all things that are accomplished in the world, even by those who are aliens  from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are accomplished by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of marriage yoke together those who have lived as strangers: and because of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in marriage contracts a stranger is made partner of a stranger's person and possessions. By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> husbandry also is sustained, for he who believes not that he shall receive a harvest endures not the toils. By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> sea-faring men, trusting to the thinnest plank, exchange that most solid element, the land, for the restless motion of the waves, committing themselves to uncertain hopes, and carrying with them a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> more sure than any anchor. By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> therefore most of men's affairs are held together: and not among us only has there been this belief, but also, as I have said, among those who are without.  For if they receive not the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, but bring forward certain doctrines of their own, even these they accept by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>4. The lesson also which was read today invites you to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by setting before you the way in which you also must please God: for it affirms that <em>without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible to please Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310766"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;11:6</a></span> For when will a man resolve to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless he believes that <em>He is a giver of reward?</em> When will a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> choose a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> life, or a young man live soberly, if they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not that for <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> there is <em>a crown that fades not away</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310767"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:4</a></span>? Faith is an eye that enlightens every <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and imparts understanding; for the Prophet says, <em>And if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, you shall not understand</em>. </p>

<p>Faith <em>stops the mouths of lions</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310769"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse34">Hebrews&nbsp;11:34</a></span>, as in Daniel's case: for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says concerning him, that <em>Daniel was brought up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in his God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310770"><a href="../bible/dan006.htm#verse23">Daniel&nbsp;6:23</a></span> Is there anything more fearful than the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? Yet even against him we have no other shield than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> , an impalpable buckler against an unseen foe. For he sends forth various arrows, and <em>shoots down in the dark night</em>  those that watch not; but, since the enemy is unseen, we have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as our strong armour, according to the saying of the Apostle, <em>In all things taking the shield of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310773"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse16">Ephesians&nbsp;6:16</a></span> A fiery dart of desire of base indulgence is often cast forth from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, suggesting a picture of the judgment, cools down the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and quenches the dart.</p>

<p>5. There is much to tell of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the whole day would not be time sufficient for us to describe it fully. At present let us be content with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> only, as one of the examples from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, seeing that we have been made his sons through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He was justified not only by works, but also by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> : for though he did many things well, yet he was never called the friend of God , except when he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Moreover, his every work was performed in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he left his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; left country, and place, and home through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note310776"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse8">Hebrews&nbsp;11:8-10</a></span> In like manner, therefore, as he was justified be thou justified also. In his body he was already dead in regard to offspring, and Sarah his wife was now old, and there was no hope left of having children. God promises the old man a child, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <em>without being weakened in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, though he considered his own body now as good as dead</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310777"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;4:19</a></span>, heeded not the weakness of his body, but the power of Him who promised, because <em>he counted Him faithful who had promised</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310778"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse11">Hebrews&nbsp;11:11-12</a></span>, and so beyond all expectation gained the child from bodies as it were already dead. And when, after he had gained his son, he was commanded to offer him up, although he had heard the word, <em>In Isaac shall your seed be called</em> , he proceeded to offer up his son, his only son, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, believing <em>that God is able to raise up even from the dead</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310780"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse19">Hebrews&nbsp;11:19</a></span> And having bound his son, and laid him on the wood, he did in purpose offer him, but by the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in delivering to him a lamb instead of his child, he received his son alive. Being faithful in these things, he was sealed for righteousness, <em>and received <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> as a seal of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he had while he was in uncircumcision</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310781"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;4:11</a></span>, having received a promise <em>that he should be the father of many nations</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310782"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;17:5</a></span> .</p>

<p>6. Let us see, then, how <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is the father of many nations. <span class="stiki" id="note310783"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;4:17-18</a></span> Of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> he is confessedly the father, through succession according to the flesh. But if we hold to the succession according to the flesh, we shall be compelled to say that the oracle was false. For according to the flesh he is no longer father of us all: but the example of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> makes us all sons of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. How? And in what manner? With men it is incredible that one should rise from the dead; as in like manner it is incredible also that there should be offspring from aged <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as good as dead. But when Christ is preached as having been crucified on the tree, and as having died and risen again, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it. By the likeness therefore of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we are adopted into the sonship of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. And then, following upon our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we receive like him the spiritual seal, being <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> through Baptism, not in the foreskin of the body, but in the heart, according to Jeremiah, saying, <em>And you shall be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> unto God in the foreskin of your heart</em> : and according to the Apostle, <em>in the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, having been buried with Him in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a></em>, and the rest <span class="stiki" id="note310785"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse11">Colossians&nbsp;2:11-12</a></span> .</p>

<p>7. This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> if we keep we shall be free from condemnation, and shall be adorned with all kinds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For so great is the strength of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as even to buoy men up in walking on the sea. Peter was a man like ourselves, made up of flesh and blood, and living upon like food. But when Jesus said, <em>Come</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310786"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;14:29</a></span>, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and walked upon the waters, and found his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> safer upon the waters than any ground; and his heavy body was upheld by the buoyancy of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But though he had safe footing over the water as long as he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, yet when he <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>, at once he began to sink: for as his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> gradually relaxed, his body also was drawn down with it. And when He saw his distress, Jesus who remedies the distresses of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, said, <em>O thou of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, wherefore did you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note310787"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse31">Mark&nbsp;14:31</a></span>? And being nerved again by Him who grasped his right hand, he had no sooner recovered his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, than, led by the hand of the Master, he resumed the same walking upon the waters: for this the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> indirectly mentioned, saying, <em>when they had gone up into the ship</em>.  For it says not that Peter swam across and went up, but gives us to understand that, after returning the same distance that he went to meet Jesus, he went up again into the ship.</p>

<p>8. Yea, so much power has <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that not the believer only is saved, but some have been saved by others believing. The paralytic in Capernaum was not a believer, but they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> who brought him, and let him down through the tiles <span class="stiki" id="note310789"><a href="../bible/mar002.htm#verse4">Mark&nbsp;2:4</a></span>: for the sick man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shared the sickness of his body. And think not that I accuse him without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> itself says, <em>when Jesus saw</em>, not his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but <em>their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>, He says to the sick of the palsy, Arise!  The bearers <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and the sick of the palsy enjoyed the blessing of the cure.</p>

<p>9. Would you see yet more surely that some are saved by others' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Lazarus died <span class="stiki" id="note310791"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;11:14-44</a></span>: one day had passed, and a second, and a third: his sinews  were decayed, and corruption was preying already upon his body. How could one four days dead <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and entreat the Redeemer on his own behalf? But what the dead man lacked was supplied by his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sisters. For when the Lord had come, the sister fell down before Him, and when He said, <em>Where have you laid him?</em> and she had made answer, <em>Lord, by this time he stinks; for he has been four days dead</em>, the Lord said, <em>If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, you shall see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God</em>; as much as saying, Supply thou the dead man's lack of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and the sisters' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had so much power, that it recalled the dead from the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Have then men by believing, the one on behalf of the other, been able to raise  the dead, and shall not thou, if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> sincerely on your own behalf, be much rather profited? Nay, even if you be faithless, or of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the Lord is loving unto man; He condescends to you on your repentance: only on your part say with honest <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, <em>Lord, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, help thou mine unbelief</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310794"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse24">Mark&nbsp;9:24</a></span> But if you think that thou really art faithful, but hast not yet the fullness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, thou too hast need to say like the Apostles, <em>Lord, increase our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note310795"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;17:5</a></span>: for some part you have of yourself, but the greater part you receive from Him.</p>

<p>10. For the name of Faith is in the form of speech  one, but has two distinct senses. For there is one kind of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the dogmatic, involving an assent of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on some particular point: and it is profitable to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as the Lord says: <em>He that hears My words, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> Him that sent Me, has everlasting life, and comes not into judgment</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310797"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;5:24</a></span>: and again, <em>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in the Son is not judged, but has passed from death unto life</em>.  Oh the great loving-kindness of God! For the righteous were many years in pleasing Him: but what they succeeded in gaining by many years of well-pleasing , this Jesus now bestows on you in a single hour. For if you shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is Lord, and that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved, and shall be transported into Paradise by Him who brought in there the robber. And <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not whether it is possible; for He who on this sacred Golgotha saved the robber after one single hour of belief, the same shall save you also on your believing. </p>

<p>11. But there is a second kind of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is bestowed by Christ as a gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. <em>For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> according to the same Spirit: to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310801"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:8-9</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> then which is given of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from the Spirit is not merely doctrinal, but also works things above man's power. For whosoever has this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <em>shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310802"><a href="../bible/mar011.htm#verse23">Mark&nbsp;11:23</a></span> For whenever any one shall say this in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <em>believing that it comes to pass, and shall not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in his heart, then receives he the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></em>.</p>

<p>And of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is said, <em>If you have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a grain of mustard seed</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310803"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;17:20</a></span> For just as the grain of mustard seed is small in size, but fiery in its operation, and though sown in a small space has a circle of great branches, and when grown up is able even to shelter the fowls <span class="stiki" id="note310804"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;13:32</a></span>; so, likewise, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the swiftest moment works the greatest effects in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For, when enlightened by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has visions of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as far as is possible beholds <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and ranges round the bounds of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and before the end of this world already beholds the Judgment, and the payment of the promised rewards. Have thou therefore that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him which comes from your own self, that you may also receive from Him that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which works things above man. </p>

<p>12. But in learning the Faith and in professing it, acquire and keep that only, which is now delivered  to you by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and which has been built up strongly out of all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For since all cannot read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, some being hindered as to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them by want of learning, and others by a want of leisure, in order that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may not perish from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, we comprise the whole doctrine of the Faith in a few lines. This summary I wish you both to commit to memory when I recite it , and to rehearse it with all diligence among yourselves, not writing it out on paper , but engraving it by the memory upon your heart , taking care while you rehearse it that no Catechumen chance to overhear the things which have been delivered to you. I wish you also to keep this as a provision  through the whole course of your life, and beside this to receive no other, neither if we ourselves should change and contradict our present teaching, nor if an adverse <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, <em>transformed into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310811"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14</a></span> should wish to lead you astray. <em>For though we or an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven preach to you any other gospel than that you have received, let him be to you <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note310812"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;1:8-9</a></span> So for the present listen while I simply say the Creed , and commit it to memory; but at the proper season expect the confirmation out of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> of each part of the contents. For the articles of the Faith were not composed as seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to men; but the most important points collected out of all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> make up one complete teaching of the Faith. And just as the mustard seed in one small grain contains many branches, so also this Faith has embraced in few words all the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of godliness in the Old and New Testaments. Take heed then, brethren, and <em>hold fast the traditions</em>  which you now receive, and <em>write them on the table of your heart</em>. </p>

<p>13. Guard them with reverence, lest per chance the enemy despoil any who have grown slack; or lest some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> pervert any of the truths delivered to you. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is like putting money into the bank , even as we have now done; but from you God requires the accounts of the deposit. <em>I charge you</em>, as the Apostle says, <em>before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who quickens all things, and Christ Jesus, who before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> witnessed the good confession, that you keep</em> this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is committed to you, <em>without spot, until the appearing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a></em>.  A treasure of life has now been committed to you, and the Master demands the deposit at His appearing, <em>which in His own times He shall show, Who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; Who only has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, dwelling in light which no man can approach unto; Whom no man has seen nor can see. To Whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and power</em> <span class="stiki" id="note310818"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:15-16</a></span> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
