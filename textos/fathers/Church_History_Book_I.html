<h1>Church History (Book I)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. The Plan of the Work.</h2>

<p>1. It is my purpose to write an account of the successions of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, as well as of the times which have elapsed from the days of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> to our own; and to relate the many important events which are said to have occurred in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and to mention those who have governed and presided over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the most prominent parishes, and those who in each generation have proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">divine word</a> either orally or in writing.</p>

<p>2. It is my purpose also to give the names and number and times of those who through love of innovation have run into the greatest <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and, proclaiming themselves discoverers of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> falsely so-called <span class="stiki" id="note250012"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:20</a></span> have like fierce wolves unmercifully devastated the flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>3. It is my intention, moreover, to recount the misfortunes which immediately came upon the whole <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation in consequence of their plots against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, and to record the ways and the times in which the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">divine word</a> has been attacked by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and to describe the character of those who at various periods have contended for it in the face of blood and of tortures, as well as the confessions which have been made in our own days, and finally the gracious and kindly succor which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> has afforded them all. Since I propose to write of all these things I shall commence my work with the beginning of the dispensation  of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ</a>. </p>

<p>4. But at the outset I must crave for my work the indulgence of the wise,  for I confess that it is beyond my power to produce a perfect and complete <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a>, and since I am the first to enter upon the subject, I am attempting to traverse as it were a lonely and untrodden path.  I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that I may have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as my guide and the power of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> as my aid, since I am unable to find even the bare footsteps of those who have traveled the way before me, except in brief fragments, in which some in one way, others in another, have transmitted to us particular accounts of the times in which they lived. From afar they raise their voices like torches, and they cry out, as from some lofty and conspicuous watchtower, admonishing us where to walk and how to direct the course of our work steadily and safely.</p>

<p>5. Having gathered therefore from the matters mentioned here and there by them whatever we consider important for the present work, and having plucked like flowers from a meadow the appropriate passages from ancient writers,  we shall endeavor to embody the whole in an <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">historical</a> narrative, content if we preserve the memory of the successions of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>; if not indeed of all, yet of the most renowned of them in those <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> which are the most noted, and which even to the present time are held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.</p>

<p>6. This work seems to me of especial importance because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of no <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer who has devoted himself to this subject; and I hope that it will appear most useful to those who are fond of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">historical</a> research.</p>

<p>7. I have already given an epitome of these things in the Chronological Canons  which I have composed, but notwithstanding that, I have undertaken in the present work to write as full an account of them as I am able.</p>

<p>8. My work will begin, as I have said, with the dispensation  of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour Christ</a> &mdash; which is loftier and greater than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conception &mdash; and with a discussion of his divinity. </p>

<p>9. For it is necessary, inasmuch as we derive even <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">our name</a> from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for one who proposes to write a <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to begin with the very origin of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> dispensation, a dispensation more divine than many think.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Summary View of the Pre-existence and Divinity of Our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ.</h2>

<p>1. Since in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is a twofold <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and the one &mdash; in so far as he is thought of as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &mdash; resembles the head of the body, while the other may be compared with the feet &mdash; in so far as he, for the sake of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, put on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the same <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as our own &mdash; the following work will be complete only if we begin with the chief and lordliest events of all his history. In this way will the antiquity and divinity of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> be shown to those who suppose it of recent and foreign origin,  and imagine that it appeared only yesterday. </p>

<p>2. No language is sufficient to express the origin and the worth, the being and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore also the divine Spirit says in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecies</a>, <q>Who shall declare his generation?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250023"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;53:8</a></span> For none <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> except the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, neither can any one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> adequately except the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> alone who has begotten him. </p>

<p>3. For who beside the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> could clearly understand the Light which was before the world, the intellectual and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> Wisdom which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the ages, the living Word which was in the beginning with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> and which was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the first and only begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which was before every creature and creation visible and invisible, the commander-in-chief of the rational and immortal host of heaven, the messenger of the great counsel, the executor of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father's</a> unspoken will, the creator, with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">things</a>, the second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> after the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the true and only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the Lord and God and King of all created things, the one who has received dominion and power, with divinity itself, and with might and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>; as it is said in regard to him in the mystical passages of <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> which speak of his divinity: <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250025"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> <q>All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250026"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> </p>

<p>4. This, too, the great <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> teaches, when, as the most ancient of all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, he describes under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">divine Spirit</a> the creation and arrangement of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. He declares that the maker of the world and the creator of all things yielded to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself, and to none other than his own clearly divine and <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> Word, the making of inferior things, and communed with him respecting the creation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. <q>For,</q> says he, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said, Let us <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">make</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in our image and in our likeness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250027"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> </p>

<p>5. And another of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> confirms this, speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> as follows: <q>He spoke and they were made; he commanded and they were created.</q>  He here introduces the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father and Maker</a> as Ruler of all, commanding with a kingly nod, and second to him the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">divine Word</a>, none other than the one who is proclaimed by us, as carrying out the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father's</a> commands.</p>

<p>6. All that are said to have excelled in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">righteousness</a> and piety since the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the great servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and before him in the first place <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and his children, and as many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">righteous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as afterward appeared, have <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplated</a> him with the pure eyes of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and have recognized him and offered to him the worship which is due him as <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>7. But he, by no means neglectful of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">reverence</a> due to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, was appointed to teach the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> to them all. For instance, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, it is said, appeared as a common <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> while he was sitting at the oak of Mambre.  And he, immediately falling down, although he saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his eyes, nevertheless worshipped him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and sacrificed to him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and confessed that he was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his identity when he uttered the words, <q>Lord, the judge of all the earth, will you not execute righteous judgment?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250030"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse25">Genesis&nbsp;18:25</a></span> </p>

<p>8. For if it is unreasonable to suppose that the unbegotten and immutable <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">almighty God</a> was changed into the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or that it deceived the eyes of the beholders with the appearance of some created thing, and if it is unreasonable to suppose, on the other hand, that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> should <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> invent such things, when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God and Lord</a> who judges all the earth and executes judgment is seen in the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who else can be called, if it be not lawful to call him the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, than his only pre-existent Word?  Concerning whom it is said in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <q>He sent his Word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</q> </p>

<p>9. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> most clearly proclaims him second Lord after the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when he says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> rained upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> brimstone and fire from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250033"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;19:24</a></span> The <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> also calls him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he appeared again to Jacob in the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and said to Jacob, <q>Your name shall be called no more <em>Jacob</em>, but <em>Israel</em> shall be your name, because you have prevailed with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250034"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;32:28</a></span> Wherefore also Jacob called the name of that place <q>Vision of God,</q>  saying, <q>For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250036"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse30">Genesis&nbsp;32:30</a></span> </p>

<p>10. Nor is it admissible to suppose that the theophanies recorded were appearances of subordinate <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for whenever any of these appeared to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> does not conceal the fact, but calls them by name not <em>God</em> nor <em>Lord</em>, but <em>angels</em>, as it is easy to prove by numberless testimonies.</p>

<p>11. Joshua, also, the successor of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, calls him, as leader of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and archangels and of the supramundane powers, and as lieutenant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,  entrusted with the second rank of sovereignty and rule over all, <q>captain of the <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">host</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</q> although he saw him not otherwise than again in the form and appearance of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For it is written:</p>

<p>12. <q>And it came to pass when Joshua was at <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>  that he looked and saw a man standing over against him with his sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went unto him and said, Are you for us or for our adversaries? And he said unto him, As captain of the <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">host</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and said unto him, Lord, what do you command your servant? And the captain of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said unto Joshua, Loose your shoe from off your feet, for the place whereon you stand is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</q> </p>

<p>13. You will perceive also from the same words that this was no other than he who talked with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.  For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says in the same words and with reference to the same one, <q>When the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> saw that he drew near to see, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> called to him out of the bush and said, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. And he said, What is it? And he said, Draw not near hither; loose your shoe from off your feet, for the place whereon you stand is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ground. And he said unto him, I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your fathers, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob.</q> </p>

<p>14. And that there is a certain substance which lived and subsisted  before the world, and which ministered unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father and God</a> of the universe for the formation of all created things, and which is called the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> and Wisdom, we may learn, to quote other <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> in addition to those already cited, from the mouth of Wisdom herself, who reveals most clearly through Solomon the following <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> concerning herself: <q>I, Wisdom, have dwelt with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and I have invoked understanding. Through me kings reign, and princes ordain righteousness. Through me the great are magnified, and through me sovereigns rule the earth.</q> </p>

<p>15. To which she adds: <q>The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> created me in the beginning of his ways, for his works; before the world he established me, in the beginning, before he made the earth, before he made the depths, before the mountains were settled, before all hills he begot me. When he prepared the heavens I was present with him, and when he established the fountains of the region under heaven  I was with him, disposing. I was the one in whom he delighted; daily I rejoiced before him at all times when he was rejoicing at having completed the world.</q> </p>

<p>16. That the divine Word, therefore, pre-existed and appeared to some, if not to all, has thus been briefly shown by us.</p>

<p>17. But why the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was not preached in ancient times to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and to all nations, as it is now, will appear from the following considerations.  The life of the ancients was not of such a kind as to permit them to receive the all-wise and all-virtuous teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>18. For immediately in the beginning, after his original life of blessedness, the first man despised the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and fell into this mortal and perishable state, and exchanged his former divinely inspired luxury for this curse-laden earth. His descendants having filled our earth, showed themselves much worse, with the exception of one here and there, and entered upon a certain brutal and insupportable mode of life.</p>

<p>19. They thought neither of city nor state, neither of arts nor sciences. They were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> even of the name of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. As nomads, they passed their lives in deserts, like wild and fierce beasts, destroying, by an excess of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the seeds of thought and of culture implanted in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. They gave themselves wholly over to all kinds of profanity, now seducing one another, now slaying one another, now eating human flesh, and now daring to wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Gods and to undertake those battles of the giants celebrated by all; now planning to fortify earth against heaven, and in the madness of ungoverned <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to prepare an attack upon the very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all. </p>

<p>20. On account of these things, when they conducted themselves thus, the all-seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent down upon them floods and conflagrations as upon a wild forest spread over the whole earth. He cut them down with continuous famines and plagues, with wars, and with thunderbolts from heaven, as if to check some terrible and obstinate disease of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with more severe punishments.</p>

<p>21. Then, when the excess of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> had overwhelmed nearly all the race, like a deep fit of <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, beclouding and darkening the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> and first-created wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the pre-existent Word himself, induced by his exceeding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, appeared to his servants, now in the form of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and again to one and another of those ancients who enjoyed the favor of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in his own person as the saving power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not otherwise, however, than in the shape of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because it was impossible to appear in any other way.</p>

<p>22. And as by them the seeds of piety were sown among a multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and the whole <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">nation</a>, descended from the Hebrews, devoted themselves persistently to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he imparted to them through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as to multitudes still corrupted by their ancient practices, images and <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of a certain <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystic</a> <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and elements of other spiritual principles, but he did not grant them a complete <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> themselves.</p>

<p>23. But when their <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> became celebrated, and, like a sweet odor, was diffused among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as a result of their influence the dispositions of the majority of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> were softened by the lawgivers and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who arose on every side, and their wild and savage brutality was changed into mildness, so that they enjoyed deep peace, friendship, and social intercourse.  Then, finally, at the time of the origin of the Roman Empire, there appeared again to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and nations throughout the world, who had been, as it were, previously assisted, and were now fitted to receive the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that same teacher of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the minister of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> in all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, the divine and heavenly <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body not at all differing in substance from our own. He did and suffered the things which had been <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a>. For it had been foretold that one who was at the same time <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should come and dwell in the world, should perform <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>, and should show himself a teacher to all nations of the piety of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. The marvelous nature of his birth, and his new teaching, and his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> had also been foretold; so likewise the manner of his death, his <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a>, and, finally, his divine ascension into heaven.</p>

<p>24. For instance, Daniel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">divine Spirit</a>, seeing his kingdom at the end of time,  was inspired thus to describe the divine vision in language fitted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> comprehension: <q>For I beheld,</q> he says, <q>until thrones were placed, and the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of Days</a> did sit, whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was a flame of fire and his wheels burning fire. A river of fire flowed before him. Thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. He appointed judgment, and the books were opened.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250050"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse9">Daniel&nbsp;7:9-10</a></span> </p>

<p>25. And again, <q>I saw,</q> says he, <q>and behold, one like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> came with the clouds of heaven, and he hastened unto the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of Days</a> and was brought into his presence, and there was given him the dominion and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the kingdom; and all peoples, tribes, and tongues serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away, and his kingdom shall not be destroyed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250051"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse13">Daniel&nbsp;7:13-14</a></span> </p>

<p>26. It is clear that these words can refer to no one else than to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Word who was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who was called the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> because of his <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">final appearance in the flesh</a>.</p>

<p>27. But since we have collected in separate books  the selections from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which relate to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour Jesus Christ</a>, and have arranged in a more <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> form those things which have been <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> concerning him, what has been said will suffice for the present.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. The Name Jesus and also the Name Christ were known from the Beginning, and were honored by the Inspired Prophets.</h2>

<p>1. It is now the proper place to show that the very <a href="../cathen/08374x.htm">name Jesus</a> and also the <a href="../cathen/08374x.htm">name Christ</a> were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by the ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p>2. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was the first to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/08374x.htm">name of Christ</a> as a name especially august and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>. When he delivered <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">types</a> and <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of heavenly things, and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> images, in accordance with the oracle which said to him, <q>Look that you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you in the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250054"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse40">Exodus&nbsp;25:40</a></span> he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in so far as that was possible, and him he called <em>Christ</em>.  And thus to this dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>, which in his opinion surpassed the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> position among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, he attached for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> the <a href="../cathen/08374x.htm">name of Christ</a>.</p>

<p>3. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> so well that in <em>Christ</em> was something divine. And the same one foreseeing, under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">divine Spirit</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374x.htm">name Jesus</a>, dignified it also with a certain distinguished privilege. For the <a href="../cathen/08374x.htm">name of Jesus</a>, which had never been uttered among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> before the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, he applied first and only to the <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">one</a> who he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> would receive after his death, again as a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">type</a> and <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>, the supreme command.</p>

<p>4. His successor, therefore, who had not hitherto borne the name Jesus, but had been called by another name, Auses,  which had been given him by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, he now called Jesus, bestowing the name upon him as a gift of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, far greater than any kingly diadem. For <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Jesus</a> himself, the <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">son of Nave</a>, bore a resemblance to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> in the fact that he alone, after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and after the completion of the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> worship which had been transmitted by him, succeeded to the government of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and pure <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>.</p>

<p>5. Thus <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> bestowed the <a href="../cathen/08374x.htm">name</a> of our Saviour, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as a mark of the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, upon the two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who in his time surpassed all the rest of the people in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; namely, upon the <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">high priest</a> and upon <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">his own successor in the government</a>.</p>

<p>6. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that came after also clearly foretold <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by name, predicting at the same time the plots which the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish people</a> would form against him, and the calling of the nations through him. Jeremiah, for instance, speaks as follows: <q>The Spirit before our face, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ the Lord</a>, was taken in their destructions; of whom we said, under his shadow we shall live among the nations.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250057"><a href="../bible/lam004.htm#verse20">Lamentations&nbsp;4:20</a></span> And David, in perplexity, says, <q>Why did the nations rage and the people <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> vain things? The kings of the earth set themselves in array, and the rulers were gathered together against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> and against his <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a></q>;  to which he adds, in the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said unto me, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you. Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.</q> </p>

<p>7. And not only those who were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>, and who for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> were anointed with especially prepared oil, were adorned with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">name of Christ</a> among the Hebrews, but also the kings whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> anointed under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">divine Spirit</a>, and thus constituted, as it were, typical <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christs</a>. For they also bore in their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> types of the royal and sovereign power of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and only <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">divine Word</a> who rules over all.</p>

<p>8. And we have been told also that certain of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> themselves became, by the act of anointing, <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christs</a> in type, so that all these have reference to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the divinely inspired and heavenly <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>, who is the only <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of all, and the only King of every creature, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father's</a> only supreme <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</p>

<p>9. And a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this is that no one of those who were of old <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolically</a> anointed, whether <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or kings, or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, possessed so great a power of inspired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as was exhibited by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour and Lord Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and only <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>10. None of them at least, however superior in dignity and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> they may have been for many generations among their own people, ever gave to their followers the name of <em>Christians</em> from their own typical name of <em>Christ</em>. Neither was divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> ever rendered to any one of them by their subjects; nor after their death was the disposition of their followers such that they were ready to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">die</a> for the one whom they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. And never did so great a commotion arise among all the nations of the earth in respect to any one of that age; for the mere <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> could not act with such power among them as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself which was exhibited by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>.</p>

<p>11. He, although he received no <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> and types of <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a> from any one, although he was not born of a race of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, although he was not elevated to a kingdom by military guards, although he was not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> like those of old, although he obtained no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> nor pre-eminence among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nevertheless was adorned by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> with all, if not with the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>, yet with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself.</p>

<p>12. And therefore, although he did not possess like <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> with those whom we have mentioned, he is called <em>Christ</em> more than all of them. And as himself the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and only <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he has filled the whole earth with the truly august and sacred name of <em>Christians</em>, committing to his followers no longer types and images, but the uncovered <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> themselves, and a heavenly life in the very doctrines of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>13. And he was not anointed with oil prepared from material substances, but, as befits divinity, with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">divine Spirit</a> himself, by participation in the unbegotten deity of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. And this is taught also again by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, who exclaims, as if in the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon me; therefore has he anointed me. He has sent me to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, to proclaim deliverance to captives, and recovery of sight to the blind.</q> </p>

<p>14. And not only Isaiah, but also David addresses him, saying, <q>Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is forever and ever. A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.</q>  Here the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> calls him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the first verse, in the second it <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> him with a royal scepter.</p>

<p>15. Then a little farther on, after the divine and royal power, it represents him in the third place as having become <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, being anointed not with oil made of material substances, but with the divine oil of gladness. It thus indicates his special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, far superior to and different from that of those who, as types, were of old anointed in a more material way.</p>

<p>16. And elsewhere the same writer speaks of him as follows: <q>The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool</q>;  and, <q>Out of the womb, before the morning star, have I begotten you. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> has sworn and he will not repent. You are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> forever after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedec</a>.</q> </p>

<p>17. But this <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedec</a> is introduced in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most high God</a>,  not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by any anointing oil, especially prepared, and not even belonging by descent to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Wherefore after his order, but not after the order of the others, who received <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> and types, was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> proclaimed, with an appeal to an oath, <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</p>

<p>18. History, therefore, does not relate that he was anointed corporeally by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nor that he belonged to the lineage of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but that he came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself before the morning star, that is before the organization of the world, and that he obtained an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and undecaying <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> ages.</p>

<p>19. But it is a great and convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his incorporeal and divine unction that he alone of all those who have ever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> is even to the present day called <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> throughout the world, and is confessed and witnessed to under this name, and is commemorated both by Greeks and Barbarians and even to this day is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> as a King by his followers throughout the world, and is admired as more than a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and only <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  And besides all this, as the pre-existent <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, called into being before all ages, he has received august <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and is worshipped as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>20. But most wonderful of all is the fact that we who have <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> ourselves to him, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> him not only with our voices and with the sound of words, but also with complete elevation of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so that we choose to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">give testimony</a> unto him rather than to preserve our own lives.</p>

<p>21. I have of necessity prefaced my history with these matters in order that no one, judging from the date of his <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, may think that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour and Lord Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, has but recently come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">being</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Religion Proclaimed by Him to All Nations Was Neither New Nor Strange.</h2>

<p>1. But that no one may suppose that his doctrine is new and strange, as if it were framed by a man of recent origin, differing in no respect from other men, let us now briefly consider this point also.</p>

<p>2. It is admitted that when in recent times the appearance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour Jesus Christ</a> had become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> there immediately made its appearance a new nation; a nation confessedly not small, and not dwelling in some corner of the earth, but the most numerous and pious of all nations,  indestructible and unconquerable, because it always receives assistance from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This nation, thus suddenly appearing at the time appointed by the inscrutable counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the one which has been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by all with the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>3. One of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when he saw beforehand with the eye of the Divine Spirit that which was to be, was so astonished at it that he cried out, <q>Who has heard of such things, and who has spoken thus? Hath the earth brought forth in one day, and has a nation been born at once?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250067"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;66:8</a></span> And the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> gives a hint also of the name by which the nation was to be called, when he says, <q>Those that serve me shall be called by a new name, which shall be blessed upon the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250068"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;65:15-16</a></span> </p>

<p>4. But although it is clear that we are new and that this new name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> has really but recently been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> among all nations, nevertheless our life and our conduct, with our doctrines of religion, have not been lately invented by us, but from the first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so to speak, have been established by the natural understanding of divinely favored men of old. That this is so we shall show in the following way.</p>

<p>5. That the Hebrew nation is not new, but is universally <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> on account of its antiquity, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all. The books and writings of this people contain accounts of ancient men, rare indeed and few in number, but nevertheless distinguished for piety and righteousness and every other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Of these, some <a href="../cathen/01551c.htm">excellent men</a> lived before the flood, others of the sons and descendants of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> lived after it, among them <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, whom the Hebrews celebrate as their own founder and forefather.</p>

<p>6. If any one should assert that all those who have enjoyed the testimony of righteousness, from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself back to the first man, were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in fact if not in name, he would not go beyond the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. </p>

<p>7. For that which the name indicates, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man, through the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is distinguished for <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and righteousness, for patience in life and manly <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and for a profession of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> toward the one and only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all&mdash; all that was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> practiced by them not less than by us.</p>

<p>8. They did not care about <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the body, neither do we. They did not care about observing <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, nor do we. They did not avoid certain kinds of food, neither did they regard the other distinctions which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> first delivered to their posterity to be observed as <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>; nor do <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the present day do such things. But they also clearly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the very <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it has already been shown that he appeared unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that he imparted revelations to Isaac, that he talked with Jacob, that he held converse with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that came after.</p>

<p>9. Hence you will find those divinely favored men <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to the passage which says of them, <q>Touch not my Christs, and do my <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> no harm.</q> </p>

<p>10. So that it is clearly necessary to consider <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">that religion</a>, which has lately been preached to all nations through the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the first and most ancient of all <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a>, and the one discovered by those divinely favored men in the age of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</p>

<p>11. If it is said that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, a long time afterward, was given the command of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, we reply that nevertheless before this it was declared that he had received the testimony of righteousness through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; as the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine word</a> says, <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> believed in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250071"><a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;15:6</a></span> </p>

<p>12. And indeed unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who was thus before his <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> a justified man, there was given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who revealed himself unto him (but this was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself, the word of God), a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in regard to those who in coming ages should be justified in the same way as he. The <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> was in the following words: <q>And in you shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250072"><a href="../bible/gen012.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;12:3</a></span> And again, <q>He shall become a nation great and numerous; and in him shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250073"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;18:18</a></span> </p>

<p>13. It is permissible to understand this as fulfilled in us. For he, having renounced the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of his fathers, and the former <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his life, and having confessed the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> over all, and having worshipped him with deeds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and not with the service of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> which was afterward given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, was justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who appeared unto him. To him, then, who was a man of this character, it was said that all the tribes and all the nations of the earth should be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in him.</p>

<p>14. But that very religion of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> has reappeared at the present time, practiced in deeds, more efficacious than words, by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> alone throughout the world.</p>

<p>15. What then should prevent the confession that we who are of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> practice one and the same mode of life and have one and the same religion as those divinely favored men of old? Whence it is evident that the perfect religion committed to us by the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not new and strange, but, if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must be spoken, it is the first and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. This may suffice for this subject.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The Time of his Appearance among Men.</h2>

<p>1. And now, after this necessary introduction to our proposed history of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we can enter, so to speak, upon our journey, beginning with the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">appearance of our Saviour in the flesh</a>. And we invoke <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father of the Word, and him, of whom we have been speaking, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> himself our Saviour and Lord, the heavenly <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, as our aid and fellow-laborer in the narration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>2. It was in the forty-second year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>  and the twenty-eighth after the subjugation of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the death of Antony and Cleopatra, with whom the dynasty of the Ptolemies in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> came to an end, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ</a> was born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, according to the prophecies which had been uttered concerning him. <span class="stiki" id="note250075"><a href="../bible/mic005.htm#verse2">Micah&nbsp;5:2</a></span> His birth took place during the first census, while Cyrenius was governor of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. </p>

<p>3. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Flavius Josephus</a>, the most celebrated of Hebrew historians, also mentions this census,  which was taken during Cyrenius' term of office. In the same connection he gives an account of the uprising of the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galileans</a>, which took place at that time, of which also <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">Luke</a>, among our writers, has made mention in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts</a>, in the following words: <q>After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away a multitude  after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> him, were dispersed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250079"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse37">Acts&nbsp;5:37</a></span> </p>

<p>4. The <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">above-mentioned author</a>, in the eighteenth book of his Antiquities, in agreement with these words, adds the following, which we quote exactly: <q>Cyrenius, a member of the senate, one who had held other offices and had passed through them all to the consulship, a man also of great dignity in other respects, came to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> with a small retinue, being sent by <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">C&aelig;sar</a> to be a judge of the nation and to make an assessment of their property.</q> </p>

<p>5. And after a little  he says: <q>But Judas,  a Gaulonite, from a city called Gamala, taking with him Sadduchus,  a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, urged the people to revolt, both of them saying that the taxation meant nothing else than downright <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">slavery</a>, and exhorting the nation to defend their liberty.</q></p>

<p>6. And in the second book of his History of the Jewish War, he writes as follows concerning the same man: <q>At this time a certain <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilean</a>, whose name was Judas, persuaded his countrymen to revolt, declaring that they were cowards if they submitted to pay tribute to the Romans, and if they endured, besides <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, masters who were mortal.</q>  These things are recorded by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. About the Time of Christ, in accordance with Prophecy, the Rulers who had governed the Jewish Nation in Regular Succession from the Days of Antiquity came to an End, and Herod, the First Foreigner, Became King.</h2>

<p>1. When <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>,  the first ruler of foreign blood, became King, the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> received its fulfillment, according to which there should <q>not be wanting a prince of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Judah</a>, nor a ruler from his loins, until he come for whom it is reserved.</q>  The latter, he also shows, was to be the expectation of the nations. </p>

<p>2. This prediction remained unfulfilled so long as it was permitted them to live under rulers from their own nation, that is, from the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to the reign of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>. Under the latter, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, the first foreigner, was given the <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Kingdom of the Jews</a> by the Romans. As <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> relates,  he was an <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Idumean</a>  on his father's side and an <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> on his mother's. But <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Africanus</a>,  who was also no common writer, says that they who were more accurately informed about him report that he was a son of Antipater, and that the latter was the son of a certain Herod of Ascalon,  one of the so-called servants  of the temple of Apollo.</p>

<p>3. This Antipater, having been taken a prisoner while a boy by <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Idumean</a> robbers, lived with them, because his father, being a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man, was unable to pay a ransom for him. Growing up in their practices he was afterward befriended by Hyrcanus,  the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. A son of his was that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> who lived in the times of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>. </p>

<p>4. When the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Kingdom of the Jews</a> had devolved upon such a man the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">expectation of the nations</a> was, according to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, already at the door. For with him their princes and governors, who had ruled in regular succession from the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> came to an end.</p>

<p>5. Before their captivity and their transportation to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> they were ruled by Saul first and then by David, and before the kings leaders governed them who were called Judges, and who came after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and his successor <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Jesus</a>.</p>

<p>6. After their return from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> they continued to have without interruption an aristocratic form of government, with an oligarchy. For the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had the direction of affairs until Pompey, the Roman general, took <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by force, and defiled the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places by entering the very innermost sanctuary of the temple.  Aristobulus,  who, by the right of ancient succession, had been up to that time both king and <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, he sent with his children in chains to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and gave to Hyrcanus, brother of Aristobulus, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>, while the whole nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was made tributary to the Romans from that time. </p>

<p>7. But Hyrcanus, who was the last of the regular line of <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a>, was very soon afterward taken prisoner by the Parthians,  and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, the first foreigner, as I have already said, was made King of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish nation</a> by the Roman senate and by <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>.</p>

<p>8. Under him <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared in bodily shape, and the expected Salvation of the nations and their calling followed in accordance with <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.  From this time the princes and rulers of Judah, I mean of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation, came to an end, and as a natural consequence the order of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>, which from ancient times had proceeded regularly in closest succession from <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> to <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, was immediately thrown into confusion. </p>

<p>9. Of these things <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> is also a witness,  who shows that when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was made King by the Romans he no longer appointed the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> from the ancient line, but gave the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to certain obscure <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. A course similar to that of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> in the appointment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was pursued by his son Archelaus,  and after him by the Romans, who took the government into their own hands. </p>

<p>10. The same writer shows  that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was the first that locked up the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred garment</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> under his own seal and refused to permit the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> to keep it for themselves. The same course was followed by Archelaus after him, and after Archelaus by the Romans.</p>

<p>11. These things have been recorded by us in order to show that another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> has been fulfilled in the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">appearance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour Jesus Christ</a>. For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, in the Book of Daniel, <span class="stiki" id="note250105"><a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse26">Daniel&nbsp;9:26</a></span> having expressly mentioned a certain number of weeks until the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of which we have treated in other books,  most clearly prophesies, that after the completion of those weeks the unction among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> should totally perish. And this, it has been clearly shown, was fulfilled at the time of the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour Jesus Christ</a>. This has been necessarily premised by us as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the correctness of the time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Alleged Discrepancy in the Gospels in regard to the Genealogy of Christ.</h2>

<p>1. Matthew and Luke in their gospels have given us the <a href="../cathen/06410a.htm">genealogy of Christ</a> differently, and many suppose that they are at variance with one another. Since as a consequence every believer, in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, has been <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> to invent some explanation which shall harmonize the two passages, permit us to subjoin the account of the matter which has come down to us,  and which is given by <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Africanus</a>, who was mentioned by us just above, in his epistle to Aristides,  where he discusses the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/06410a.htm">gospel genealogies</a>. After refuting the opinions of others as forced and deceptive, he give the account which he had received from tradition  in these words:</p>

<p>2. For whereas the <a href="../cathen/06408a.htm">names of the generations</a> were reckoned in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> either according to nature or according to law&mdash;according to nature by the succession of legitimate offspring, and according to law whenever another raised up a child to the name of a brother dying childless;  for because a clear hope of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> was not yet given they had a representation of the future promise by a kind of mortal resurrection, in order that the name of the one deceased might be perpetuated&mdash;</p>

<p>3. whereas then some of those who are inserted in this genealogical table succeeded by natural descent, the son to the father, while others, though born of one father, were ascribed by name to another, mention was made of both of those who were progenitors in fact and of those who were so only in name.</p>

<p>4. Thus neither of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a> is in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, for one reckons by nature, the other by law. For the line of descent from Solomon and that from Nathan  were so involved, the one with the other, by the raising up of children to the childless and by second marriages, that the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are justly considered to belong at one time to one, at another time to another; that is, at one time to the reputed fathers, at another to the actual fathers. So that both these accounts are strictly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and come down to Joseph with considerable intricacy indeed, yet quite accurately.</p>

<p>5. But in order that what I have said may be made clear I shall explain the interchange of the generations. If we reckon the generations from David through Solomon, the third from the end is found to be Matthan, who begot Jacob the father of Joseph. But if, with Luke, we reckon them from Nathan the son of David, in like manner the third from the end is Melchi,  whose son <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a> was the father of Joseph. For Joseph was the son of <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a>, the son of Melchi.</p>

<p>6. Joseph therefore being the object proposed to us, it must be shown how it is that each is recorded to be his father, both Jacob, who derived his descent from Solomon, and <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a>, who derived his from Nathan; first how it is that these two, Jacob and <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a>, were brothers, and then how it is that their fathers, Matthan and Melchi, although of different <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, are declared to be grandfathers of Joseph.</p>

<p>7. Matthan and Melchi having married in succession the same <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, begot children who were uterine brothers, for the law did not prohibit a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, whether such by <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> or by the death of her husband, from marrying another.</p>

<p>8. By Estha  then (for this was the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> name according to tradition) Matthan, a descendant of Solomon, first begot Jacob. And when Matthan was dead, Melchi, who traced his descent back to Nathan, being of the same tribe  but of another <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>,  married her as before said, and begot a son <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a>.</p>

<p>9. Thus we shall find the two, Jacob and <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a>, although belonging to different <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, yet brethren by the same mother. Of these the one, Jacob, when his brother <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a> had died childless, took the latter's wife and begot by her a son  Joseph, his own son by nature  and in accordance with reason. Wherefore also it is written: 'Jacob begot Joseph.' <span class="stiki" id="note250118"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;1:6</a></span> But according to law  he was the son of <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a>, for Jacob, being the brother of the latter, raised up seed to him.</p>

<p>10. Hence the <a href="../cathen/06410a.htm">genealogy</a> traced through him will not be rendered void, which the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> Matthew in his <a href="../cathen/06410a.htm">enumeration</a> gives thus: 'Jacob begot Joseph.' But Luke, on the other hand, says: 'Who was the son, as was supposed'  (for this he also adds), 'of Joseph, the son of <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a>, the son of Melchi'; for he could not more clearly express the <a href="../cathen/06410a.htm">generation</a> according to law. And the expression 'he begot' he has omitted in his <a href="../cathen/06410a.htm">genealogical</a> table up to the end, tracing the <a href="../cathen/06410a.htm">genealogy</a> back to Adam the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>. This interpretation is neither incapable of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> nor is it an idle conjecture. </p>

<p>11. For the relatives of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> according to the flesh, whether with the desire of boasting or simply wishing to state the fact, in either case <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, have handed down the following account:  Some <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Idumean</a> robbers,  having attacked <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, a city of Palestine, carried away from a temple of Apollo which stood near the walls, in addition to other booty, Antipater, son of a certain temple slave named <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>. And since the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>  was not able to pay the ransom for his son, Antipater was brought up in the customs of the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Idumeans</a>, and afterward was befriended by Hyrcanus, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>12. And having been sent by Hyrcanus on an embassy to Pompey, and having restored to him the kingdom which had been invaded by his brother Aristobulus, he had the good fortune to be named <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of Palestine.  But Antipater having been slain by those who were <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of his great good fortune  was succeeded by his son <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, who was afterward, by a decree of the senate, made King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>  under Antony and <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>. His sons were <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and the other tetrarchs.  These accounts agree also with those of the Greeks. </p>

<p>13. But as there had been kept in the archives  up to that time the genealogies of the Hebrews as well as of those who traced their lineage back to proselytes,  such as Achior  the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonite</a> and Ruth the Moabitess, and to those who were mingled with the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> and came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with them, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, inasmuch as the lineage of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> contributed nothing to his advantage, and since he was goaded with the consciousness of his own ignoble extraction, burned all the genealogical records,  thinking that he might appear of noble origin if no one else were able, from the public registers, to trace back his lineage to the patriarchs or proselytes and to those mingled with them, who were called Georae. </p>

<p>14. A few of the careful, however, having obtained private records of their own, either by remembering the names or by getting them in some other way from the registers, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves on preserving the memory of their noble extraction. Among these are those already mentioned, called Desposyni,  on account of their connection with the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. Coming from Nazara and Cochaba,  villages of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>,  into other parts of the world, they drew the aforesaid genealogy from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>  and from the book of daily records  as faithfully as possible.</p>

<p>15. Whether then the case stand thus or not no one could find a clearer explanation, according to my own opinion and that of every candid person. And let this suffice us, for, although we can urge no testimony in its support,  we have nothing better or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> to offer. In any case the Gospel states the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And at the end of the same epistle he adds these words: <q>Matthan, who was descended from Solomon, begot Jacob. And when Matthan was dead, Melchi, who was descended from Nathan begot <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a> by the same <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a> and Jacob were thus uterine brothers. <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a> having died childless, Jacob raised up seed to him, begetting Joseph, his own son by nature, but by law the son of <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Eli</a>. Thus Joseph was the son of both.</q></p>

<p>17. Thus far <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Africanus</a>. And the lineage of Joseph being thus traced, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> also is virtually shown to be of the same tribe with him, since, according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, intermarriages between different tribes were not permitted.  For the command is to marry one of the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>  and lineage,  so that the inheritance may not pass from tribe to tribe. This may suffice here.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. The Cruelty of Herod toward the Infants, and the Manner of his Death.</h2>

<p>1. When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born, according to the prophecies, in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, at the time indicated, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was not a little disturbed by the enquiry of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> who came from the east, asking where he who was born <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">King of the Jews</a> was to be found&mdash;for they had seen his star, and this was their reason for taking so long a journey; for they earnestly desired to worship the infant as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, &mdash; for he imagined that his kingdom might be endangered; and he enquired therefore of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">doctors of the law</a>, who belonged to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish nation</a>, where they expected <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be born. When he learned that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Micah <span class="stiki" id="note250145"><a href="../bible/mic005.htm#verse2">Micah&nbsp;5:2</a></span> announced that <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> was to be his birthplace he commanded, in a single edict, <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">all the male infants</a> in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and all its borders, that were two years of age or less, according to the time which he had accurately ascertained from the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a>, to be slain, supposing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, as was indeed likely, would share the same <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> as the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">others of his own age</a>.</p>

<p>2. But the child anticipated the snare, being carried into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who had learned from an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> that appeared unto them what was about to happen. These things are recorded by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> in the Gospel. <span class="stiki" id="note250146"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm">Matthew&nbsp;2</a></span> </p>

<p>3. It is worth while, in addition to this, to observe the reward which <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> received for his daring crime against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and those of the same age. For immediately, without the least delay, the divine vengeance overtook him while he was still alive, and gave him a foretaste of what he was to receive after death.</p>

<p>4. It is not possible to relate here how he tarnished the supposed felicity of his reign by successive calamities in his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of wife and children, and others of his nearest relatives and dearest friends.  The account, which casts every other tragic drama into the shade, is detailed at length in the histories of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>. </p>

<p>5. How, immediately after his crime against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">other infants</a>, the punishment sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> drove him on to his death, we can best learn from the words of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">that historian</a> who, in the seventeenth book of his Antiquities of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, writes as follows concerning his end: </p>

<p>6. But the disease of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> grew more severe, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inflicting punishment for his crimes. For a slow fire burned in him which was not so apparent to those who touched him, but augmented his internal distress; for he had a terrible desire for food which it was not possible to resist. He was affected also with ulceration of the intestines, and with especially severe pains in the colon, while a watery and transparent humor settled about his feet.</p>

<p>7. He suffered also from a similar trouble in his abdomen. Nay more, his privy member was putrefied and produced worms. He found also excessive difficulty in breathing, and it was particularly disagreeable because of the offensiveness of the odor and the rapidity of respiration.</p>

<p>8. He had convulsions also in every limb, which gave him uncontrollable strength. It was said, indeed, by those who possessed the power of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> and wisdom to explain such events, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had inflicted this punishment upon the King on account of his great impiety.</p>

<p>9. The <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">writer mentioned above</a> recounts these things in the work referred to. And in the second book of his History he gives a similar account of the same <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, which runs as follows:  The disease then seized upon his whole body and distracted it by various torments. For he had a slow fever, and the itching of the skin of his whole body was insupportable. He suffered also from continuous pains in his colon, and there were swellings on his feet like those of a person suffering from dropsy, while his abdomen was inflamed and his privy member so putrefied as to produce worms. Besides this he could breathe only in an upright posture, and then only with difficulty, and he had convulsions in all his limbs, so that the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a> said that his diseases were a punishment. </p>

<p>10. But he, although wrestling with such sufferings, nevertheless clung to life and hoped for safety, and devised methods of cure. For instance, crossing over <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> he used the warm baths at Callirho&euml;,  which flow into the Lake Asphaltites,  but are themselves sweet enough to drink.</p>

<p>11. His physicians here thought that they could warm his whole body again by means of heated oil. But when they had let him down into a tub filled with oil, his eyes became weak and turned up like the eyes of a dead person. But when his attendants raised an outcry, he recovered at the noise; but finally, despairing of a cure, he commanded about fifty drachms to be distributed among the soldiers, and great sums to be given to his generals and friends.</p>

<p>12. Then returning he came to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, where, being seized with melancholy, he planned to commit an impious deed, as if challenging death itself. For, collecting from every town the most illustrious men of all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, he commanded that they be shut up in the so-called hippodrome.</p>

<p>13. And having summoned Salome,  his sister, and her husband, Alexander,  he said: 'I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at my death. But I may be lamented by others and have a splendid funeral if you are willing to perform my commands. When I shall expire surround these men, who are now under guard, as quickly as possible with soldiers, and slay them, in order that all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and every house may weep for me even against their will.' </p>

<p>14. And after a little <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> says, <q>And again he was so tortured by want of food and by a convulsive cough that, overcome by his pains, he planned to anticipate his <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>. Taking an apple he asked also for a knife, for he was accustomed to cut apples and eat them. Then looking round to see that there was no one to hinder, he raised his right hand as if to stab himself.</q> </p>

<p>15. In addition to these things the same writer records that he slew another of his own sons  before his death, the third one slain by his command, and that immediately afterward he breathed his last, not without excessive pain.</p>

<p>16. Such was the end of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, who suffered a just punishment for his slaughter of the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">children</a> of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>,  which was the result of his plots against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>.</p>

<p>17. After this an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appeared in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> to Joseph in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and commanded him to go to <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> with the child and its mother, revealing to him that those who had sought the life of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">child</a> were dead.  To this the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> adds, <q>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in the room of his father <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> he was afraid to go there; notwithstanding being warned of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> he turned aside into the parts of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250161"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;2:22</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The Times of Pilate.</h2>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">historian already mentioned</a> agrees with the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> in regard to the fact that Archelaus  succeeded to the government after <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>. He records the manner in which he received the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his father <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and by the decree of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">C&aelig;sar Augustus</a>, and how, after he had reigned ten years, he lost his kingdom, and his brothers Philip  and Herod the younger,  with Lysanias,  still ruled their own tetrarchies. The <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">same writer</a>, in the eighteenth book of his Antiquities,  says that about the twelfth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>,  who had succeeded to the empire after <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> had ruled fifty-seven years,  <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> was entrusted with the government of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and that he remained there ten full years, almost until the death of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>.</p>

<p>2. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> of those who have recently given currency to acts against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>  is clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. For the very date given in them  shows the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of their fabricators.</p>

<p>3. For the things which they have dared to say concerning the passion of the Saviour are put into the fourth consulship of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, which occurred in the seventh year of his reign; at which time it is plain that <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> was not yet ruling in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, if the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, who clearly shows in the above-mentioned work  that <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> was made <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> by <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> in the twelfth year of his reign.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. The High Priests of the Jews under whom Christ taught.</h2>

<p>1. It was in the fifteenth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>,  according to the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, and in the fourth year of the governorship of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>,  while <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and Lysanias and Philip were ruling the rest of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>,  that our Saviour and Lord, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being about thirty years of age,  came to <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and began the promulgation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>2. The <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scripture</a> says, moreover, that he passed the entire time of his ministry under the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>,  showing that in the time which belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">priesthood</a> of those two men the whole period of his teaching was completed. Since he began his work during the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and taught until <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> held the office, the entire time does not comprise quite four years.</p>

<p>3. For the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the law having been already abolished since that time, the customary usages in connection with the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to which the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> acquired his office by hereditary descent and held it for life, were also annulled and there were appointed to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a> by the Roman governors now one and now another person who continued in office not more than one year. </p>

<p>4. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> relates that there were four <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> in succession from <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> to <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>. Thus in the same book of the Antiquities  he writes as follows: <q>Valerius Gratus  having put an end to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of Ananus  appoints Ishmael,  the son of Fabi, <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>. And having removed him after a little he appoints <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazer</a>,  the son of Ananus the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, to the same office. And having removed him also at the end of a year he gives the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a> to Simon,  the son of Camithus. But he likewise held the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> no more than a year, when <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, called also <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>,  succeeded him.</q> Accordingly the whole time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour's</a> ministry is shown to have been not quite four full years, four <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a>, from <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> to the accession of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, having held office a year each. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> therefore has rightly indicated <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> as the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> under whom the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> suffered. From which also we can see that the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour's</a> ministry does not disagree with the foregoing investigation.</p>

<p>5. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour and Lord</a>, not long after the beginning of his ministry, called the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">twelve apostles</a>,  and these alone of all his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> he named <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, as a special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. And again he appointed seventy others whom he sent out two by two before his face into every place and city whither he himself was about to come. </p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Testimonies in Regard to John the Baptist and Christ.</h2>

<p>1. Not long after this John the Baptist was beheaded by the younger <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>,  as is stated in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.  <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> also records the same fact,  making mention of <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a>  by name, and stating that, although she was the wife of his brother, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> made her his own wife after <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorcing</a> his former lawful wife, who was the daughter of Aretas,  king of <a href="../cathen/11777b.htm">Petra</a>, and separating <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a> from her husband while he was still alive.</p>

<p>2. It was on her account also that he slew John, and waged <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Aretas, because of the disgrace inflicted on the daughter of the latter. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> relates that in this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, when they came to battle, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> entire army was destroyed,  and that he suffered this calamity on account of his crime against John.</p>

<p>3. The same <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> confesses in this account that John the Baptist was an exceedingly righteous man, and thus agrees with the things written of him in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. He records also that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> lost his kingdom on account of the same <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a>, and that he was driven into banishment with her, and condemned to live at Vienne in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>. </p>

<p>4. He relates these things in the eighteenth book of the Antiquities, where he writes of John in the following words:  It seemed to some of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that the army of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was destroyed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> avenged John called the Baptist.</p>

<p>5. For <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> slew him, a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man and one who exhorted the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to come and receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, practicing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and exercising righteousness toward each other and toward <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> would appear acceptable unto Him when they employed it, not for the remission of certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but for the purification of the body, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had been already purified in righteousness.</p>

<p>6. And when others gathered about him (for they found much pleasure in listening to his words), <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> feared that his great influence might lead to some sedition, for they appeared ready to do whatever he might advise. He therefore considered it much better, before any new thing should be done under John's influence, to anticipate it by slaying him, than to repent after revolution had come, and when he found himself in the midst of difficulties.  On account of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> suspicion John was sent in bonds to the above-mentioned citadel of Mach&aelig;ra,  and there slain.</p>

<p>7. After relating these things concerning John, he makes mention of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> in the same work, in the following words:  And there lived at that time <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, a wise man, if indeed it be proper to call him a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For he was a doer of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>, and a teacher of such men as receive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. And he attached to himself many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and many also of the Greeks. He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>8. When <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, on the accusation of our principal men, condemned him to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, those who had loved him in the beginning did not cease loving him. For he appeared unto them again <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">alive on the third day</a>, the divine <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> having told these and countless other wonderful things concerning him. Moreover, the race of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, named after him, continues down to the present day.</p>

<p>9. Since an historian, who is one of the Hebrews themselves, has recorded in his work these things concerning John the Baptist and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, what excuse is there left for not convicting them of being destitute of all shame, who have forged the acts against them?  But let this suffice here.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. The Disciples of our Saviour.</h2>

<p>1. The names of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to every one from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.  But there exists no catalogue of the seventy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.  Barnabas, indeed, is said to have been one of them, of whom the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> makes mention in various places,  and especially Paul in his <a href="../bible/gal000.htm">Epistle to the Galatians</a>. </p>

<p>2. They say that Sosthenes also, who wrote to the Corinthians with Paul, was one of them.  This is the account of Clement  in the fifth book of his Hypotyposes, in which he also says that Cephas was one of the seventy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,  a man who bore the same name as the apostle Peter, and the one concerning whom Paul says, <q>When Cephas came to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> I withstood him to his face.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250206"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse11">Galatians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> </p>

<p>3. <a href="../cathen/10066a.htm">Matthias</a>,  also, who was numbered with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in the place of Judas, and the one who was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by being made a candidate with him,  are likewise said to have been deemed worthy of the same calling with the seventy. They say that Thaddeus  also was one of them, concerning whom I shall presently relate an account which has come down to us.  And upon examination you will find that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> had more than seventy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, according to the testimony of Paul, who says that after his <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a> he appeared first to Cephas, then to the twelve, and after them to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom some had fallen asleep;  but the majority were still living at the time he wrote.</p>

<p>4. Afterwards he says he appeared unto James, who was one of the so-called brethren of the Saviour.  But, since in addition to these, there were many others who were called <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in imitation of the Twelve, as was Paul himself, he adds: <q>Afterward he appeared to all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250213"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:7</a></span> So much in regard to these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. But the story concerning Thaddeus is as follows.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Narrative concerning the Prince of the Edessenes.</h2>

<p>1. The divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> being noised abroad among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> on account of his wonder-working power, he attracted countless numbers from foreign countries lying far away from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, who had the hope of being cured of their diseases and of all kinds of sufferings.</p>

<p>2. For instance the <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">King Abgarus</a>,  who ruled with great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> the nations beyond the Euphrates, being afflicted with a terrible disease which it was beyond the power of human skill to cure, when he heard of the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a>, and of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which were attested by all with one accord sent a message to him by a courier and begged him to heal his disease.</p>

<p>3. But he did not at that time comply with his request; yet he deemed him worthy of a personal letter in which he said that he would send one of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to cure his disease, and at the same time promised <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to himself and all his house.</p>

<p>4. Not long afterward his promise was fulfilled. For after his <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a> and his ascent into heaven, Thomas,  one of the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, under divine impulse sent Thaddeus, who was also numbered among the seventy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,  to <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>,  as a preacher and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> of the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>5. And all that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> had promised received through him its fulfillment. You have written evidence of these things taken from the archives of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>,  which was at that time a royal city. For in the public registers there, which contain accounts of ancient times and the acts of <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a>, these things have been found preserved down to the present time. But there is no better way than to hear the epistles themselves which we have taken from the archives and have literally translated from the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac language</a>  in the following manner.</p>

<h3>Copy of an epistle written by Abgarus the ruler to Jesus, and sent to him at Jerusalem by Ananias the swift courier.</h3>

<p>6. <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a>, ruler of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus the excellent Saviour</a> who has appeared in the country of Jerusalem, greeting. I have heard the reports of you and of your cures as performed by you without medicines or herbs. For it is said that you make the blind to see and the lame to walk, that you cleanse <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> and cast out impure spirits and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and that you heal those afflicted with lingering disease, and raise the dead.</p>

<p>7. And having heard all these things concerning you, I have concluded that one of two things must be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: either you are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and having come down from heaven you do these things, or else you, who does these things, are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. </p>

<p>8. I have therefore written to you to ask you if you would take the trouble to come to me and heal the disease which I have. For I have heard that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are murmuring against you and are plotting to injure you. But I have a very small yet noble city which is great enough for us both.</p>

<h3>The answer of Jesus to the ruler Abgarus by the courier Ananias.</h3>

<p>9. <q>Blessed are you who hast believed in me without having seen me.  For it is written concerning me, that they who have seen me will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me, and that they who have not seen me will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and be saved.  But in regard to what you have written me, that I should come to you, it is necessary for me to fulfill all things here for which I have been sent, and after I have fulfilled them thus to be taken up again to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">him that sent me</a>. But after I have been taken up I will send to you one of my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that he may heal your disease and give life to you and yours.</q></p>

<h3>Further accounts</h3>

<p>10. To these epistles there was added the following account in the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac language</a>. After the ascension of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Judas,  who was also called Thomas, sent to him Thaddeus, an apostle,  one of the Seventy. When he had come he lodged with Tobias,  the son of Tobias. When the report of him got abroad, it was told <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> that an apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had come, as he had written him.</p>

<p>11. Thaddeus began then in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to heal every disease and infirmity, insomuch that all wondered. And when <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> heard of the great and wonderful things which he did and of the cures which he performed, he began to suspect that he was the one of whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had written him, saying, 'After I have been taken up I will send to you one of my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who will heal you.'</p>

<p>12. Therefore, summoning Tobias, with whom Thaddeus lodged, he said, I have heard that a certain man of power has come and is lodging in your house. Bring him to me. And Tobias coming to Thaddeus said to him, The ruler <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> summoned me and told me to bring you to him that you might heal him. And Thaddeus said, I will go, for I have been sent to him with power.</p>

<p>13. Tobias therefore arose early on the following day, and taking Thaddeus came to <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a>. And when he came, the nobles were present and stood about <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a>. And immediately upon his entrance a great vision appeared to <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> in the countenance of the apostle Thaddeus. When <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> saw it he prostrated himself before Thaddeus, while all those who stood about were astonished; for they did not see the vision, which appeared to <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> alone.</p>

<p>14. He then asked Thaddeus if he were in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who had said to him, 'I will send you one of my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who shall heal you and give you life.' And Thaddeus said, Because you have mightily believed in him that sent me, therefore have I been sent unto you. And still further, if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him, the petitions of your heart shall be granted you as you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<p>15. And <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> said to him, So much have I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him that I wished to take an army and destroy those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who crucified him, had I not been deterred from it by reason of the dominion of the Romans. And Thaddeus said, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> has fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and having fulfilled it has been taken up to his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. And <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> said to him, I too have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him and in his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</p>

<p>16. And Thaddeus said to him, Therefore I place my hand upon you in his name. And when he had done it, immediately <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> was cured of the disease and of the suffering which he had.</p>

<p>17. And <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> marvelled, that as he had heard concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, so he had received in very deed through his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> Thaddeus, who healed him without medicines and herbs, and not only him, but also Abdus  the son of Abdus, who was afflicted with the gout; for he too came to him and fell at his feet, and having received a benediction by the imposition of his hands, he was healed. The same Thaddeus cured also many other inhabitants of the city, and did wonders and marvelous works, and preached the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>18. And afterward <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> said, You, O Thaddeus, do these things with the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we marvel. But, in addition to these things, I pray you to inform me in regard to the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, how he was born; and in regard to his power, by what power he performed those deeds of which I have heard.</p>

<p>19. And Thaddeus said, Now indeed will I keep silence, since I have been sent to proclaim the word publicly. But tomorrow assemble for me all your citizens, and I will preach in their presence and sow among them the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, concerning the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, how he was born; and concerning his mission, for what purpose he was sent by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>; and concerning the power of his works, and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which he proclaimed in the world, and by what power he did these things; and concerning his new preaching, and his abasement and humiliation, and how he humbled himself, and died and debased his divinity and was crucified, and descended into Hades,  and burst the bars which from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> had not been broken,  and raised the dead; for he descended alone, but rose with many, and thus ascended to his Father. </p>

<p>20. <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> therefore commanded the citizens to assemble early in the morning to hear the preaching of Thaddeus, and afterward he ordered gold and silver to be given him. But he refused to take it, saying, If we have forsaken that which was our own, how shall we take that which is another's? These things were done in the three hundred and fortieth year. </p>

<p>I have inserted them here in their proper place, translated from the Syriac  literally, and I hope to good purpose.</p>
