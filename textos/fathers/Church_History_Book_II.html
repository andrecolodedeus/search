<h1>Church History (Book II)</h1>

<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<p>1. We have discussed in the <a href="../fathers/250101.htm">preceding book</a> those subjects in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> which it was necessary to treat by way of introduction, and have accompanied them with brief <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. Such were the divinity of the saving Word, and the antiquity of the doctrines which we teach, as well as of that evangelical life which is led by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, together with the events which have taken place in connection with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> recent appearance, and in connection with his passion and with the choice of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>

<p>2. In the present book let us examine the events which took place after his ascension, confirming some of them from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, and others from such writings as we shall refer to from time to time.</p>

<h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1. The Course pursued by the Apostles after the Ascension of Christ.</h2>

<p>1. First, then, in the place of Judas, the betrayer, <a href="../cathen/10066a.htm">Matthias</a>,  who, as has been shown  was also one of the Seventy, was chosen to the apostolate. And there were appointed to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>,  for the service of the congregation, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the laying on of the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, approved men, seven in number, of whom Stephen was one.  He first, after the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned to death</a> at the time of his ordination by the slayers of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, as if he had been promoted for this very purpose.  And thus he was the first to receive the crown, corresponding to his name,  which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who are worthy of the meed of victory.</p>

<p>2. Then <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>, whom the ancients surnamed the Just  on account of the excellence of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is recorded to have been the first to be made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of Jerusalem. This <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> was called the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>  because he was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as a son of Joseph,  and Joseph was supposed to be the father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>, being <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to him, <q>was found with child by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> before they came together,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250242"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;1:18</a></span> as the account of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Gospels shows.</p>

<p>3. But <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement</a> in the sixth book of his Hypotyposes  writes thus: <q>For they say that Peter and James and John after the ascension of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, as if also preferred by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, strove not after <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but chose <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the Just</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem.</q> </p>

<p>4. But the <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">same writer</a>, in the seventh book of the same work, relates also the following things concerning him: <q>The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> after his resurrection imparted <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the Just</a> and to John and Peter, and they imparted it to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to the seventy, of whom Barnabas was one.  But there were two Jameses:  one called <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">the Just</a>, who was thrown from the pinnacle of the temple and was beaten to death with a club by a fuller,  and another who was beheaded.</q>  Paul also makes mention of the same <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the Just</a>, where he writes, <q>Other of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> saw I none, save <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">James the Lord's brother</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250249"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;1:19</a></span> </p>

<p>5. At that time also the promise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">king of the Osrh&oelig;nians</a> was fulfilled. For Thomas, under a divine impulse, sent Thaddeus to <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> as a preacher and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> of the religion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as we have shown a little above from the document found there. </p>

<p>7. When he came to that place he healed <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> by the word of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; and after bringing all the people there into the right attitude of mind by means of his works, and leading them to adore the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he made them <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour's</a> teaching. And from that time down to the present the whole city of the <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessenes</a> has been devoted to the <a href="../cathen/08374x.htm">name of Christ</a>,  offering no common <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the beneficence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> toward them also.</p>

<p>8. These things have been drawn from ancient accounts; but let us now turn again to the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>. When the first and greatest <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was instigated by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of Jerusalem in connection with the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Stephen, and when all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, except the Twelve, were scattered throughout <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>,  some, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> says, went as far as <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a> and <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, but could not yet venture to impart the word of faith to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and therefore preached it to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> alone. </p>

<p>9. During this time <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was still <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, and entering the houses of believers was dragging men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> away and committing them to prison. </p>

<p>10. Philip also, one of those who with Stephen had been entrusted with the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, being among those who were scattered abroad, went down to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>,  and being filled with the divine power, he first preached the word to the inhabitants of that country. And <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> worked so mightily with him that even <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> with many others was attracted by his words. </p>

<p>11. <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a> was at that time so celebrated, and had acquired, by his jugglery, such influence over those who were deceived by him, that he was thought to be the great power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  But at this time, being amazed at the wonderful deeds wrought by Philip through the divine power, he feigned and counterfeited <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even going so far as to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. </p>

<p>12. And what is surprising, the same thing is done even to this day by those who follow his <a href="../cathen/13797a.htm">most impure heresy</a>.  For they, after the manner of their forefather, slipping into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, like a pestilential and <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprous</a> disease greatly afflict those into whom they are able to infuse the deadly and terrible poison concealed in themselves.  The most of these have been expelled as soon as they have been caught in their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, as <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a> himself, when detected by Peter, received the merited punishment. </p>

<p>13. But as the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour's</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was daily advancing, a certain <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> led from the land of the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> an officer of the queen of that country,  for <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> even to the present day is ruled, according to ancestral custom, by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. He, first among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, received of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the divine word from Philip in consequence of a revelation, and having become the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of believers throughout the world, he is said to have been the first on returning to his country to proclaim the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and the life-giving sojourn of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>;  so that through him in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> obtained its fulfillment, which declares that <q><a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> stretches out her hand unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<p>14. In addition to these, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, that <q>chosen vessel,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250265"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;9:15</a></span> <q>not of men neither through men, but by the revelation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> himself and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> who raised him from the dead,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250266"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;1:1</a></span> was appointed an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, being made worthy of the call by a vision and by a voice which was uttered in a revelation from heaven. </p>

<h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2. How Tiberius was affected when informed by Pilate concerning Christ.</h2>

<p>1. And when the wonderful resurrection and ascension of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> were already noised abroad, in accordance with an ancient custom which prevailed among the rulers of the provinces, of reporting to the emperor the novel occurrences which took place in them, in order that nothing might escape him, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> informed <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>  of the reports which were noised abroad through all Palestine concerning the resurrection of our Saviour Jesus from the dead.</p>

<p>2. He gave an account also of other wonders which he had learned of him, and how, after his death, having risen from the dead, he was now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by many to be a God.  They say that <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> referred the matter to the Senate,  but that they rejected it, ostensibly because they had not first examined into the matter (for an ancient law prevailed that no one should be made a God by the Romans except by a vote and decree of the Senate), but in reality because the saving teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">divine Gospel</a> did not need the confirmation and recommendation of men.</p>

<p>3. But although the Senate of the Romans rejected the proposition made in regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> still retained the opinion which he had held at first, and contrived no hostile measures against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. </p>

<p>4. These things are recorded by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>,  a man well versed in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Romans,  and in other respects of high repute, and one of those especially distinguished in Rome.  In his apology for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>,  which was written by him in the Latin language, and has been translated into Greek,  he writes as follows: </p>

<p>5. But in order that we may give an account of these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> from their origin, it was an ancient decree  that no one should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> a God by the emperor until the Senate had expressed its approval. <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> did thus concerning a certain idol, Alburnus.  And this is a point in favor of our doctrine,  that among you divine dignity is conferred by human decree. If a God does not please a man he is not made a God. Thus, according to this custom, it is necessary for man to be gracious to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>6. <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, therefore, under whom the name of Christ made its entry into the world, when this doctrine was reported to him from Palestine, where it first began, communicated with the Senate, making it clear to them that he was pleased with the doctrine.  But the Senate, since it had not itself <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the matter, rejected it. But <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> continued to hold his own opinion, and threatened death to the accusers of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.  <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Heavenly providence</a> had wisely instilled this into his mind in order that the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, unhindered at its beginning, might spread in all directions throughout the world.</p>

<h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3. The Doctrine of Christ soon spread throughout All the World.</h2>

<p>1. Thus, under the influence of heavenly power, and with the divine co-operation, the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, like the rays of the sun, quickly illumined the whole world;  and straightway, in accordance with the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>,  the voice of the inspired <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> went forth through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.</p>

<p>2. In every city and village, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> were quickly established, filled with multitudes of people like a replenished threshing-floor. And those whose <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>, in consequence of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which had descended to them from their forefathers, were fettered by the ancient disease of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, were, by the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> operating through the teaching and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, set free, as it were, from terrible masters, and found a release from the most cruel bondage. They renounced with abhorrence every species of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demoniacal</a> <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, and confessed that there was only one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the creator of all things, and him they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> piety, through the inspired and rational worship which has been planted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<p>3. But the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> being now poured out upon the rest of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a>, of <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">C&aelig;sarea in Palestine</a>, with his whole house, through a divine revelation and the agency of Peter, first received <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>;  and after him a multitude of other Greeks in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>,  to whom those who were scattered by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Stephen had preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">church of Antioch</a> was now increasing and abounding, and a multitude of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> from Jerusalem were on the ground,  among them <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and in addition many other brethren, the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> first sprang up there,  as from a fresh and life-giving fountain. </p>

<p>4. And <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a>, one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who was with them, uttered a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> concerning the famine which was about to take place,  and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> were sent to relieve the necessities of the brethren. </p>

<h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4. After the Death of Tiberius, Caius appointed Agrippa King of the Jews, having punished Herod with Perpetual Exile.</h2>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> died, after having reigned about twenty-two years,  and Caius succeeded him in the empire.  He immediately gave the government of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to Agrippa,  making him king over the tetrarchies of Philip and of Lysanias; in addition to which he bestowed upon him, not long afterward, the tetrarchy of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>,  having punished <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> (the one under whom the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> suffered ) and his wife <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a> with perpetual exile  on account of numerous crimes. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> is a witness to these facts. </p>

<p>2. Under this emperor, <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>  became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; a man most celebrated not only among many of our own, but also among many scholars without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He was a Hebrew by birth, but was inferior to none of those who held high dignities in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>. How exceedingly he labored in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and in the studies of his nation is plain to all from the work which he has done. How familiar he was with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and with the liberal studies of foreign nations, it is not necessary to say, since he is reported to have surpassed all his contemporaries in the study of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, to which he particularly devoted his attention. </p>

<h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5. Philo's Embassy to Caius in Behalf of the Jews.</h2>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> has given us an account, in five books, of the misfortunes of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> under Caius.  He recounts at the same time the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of Caius: how he called himself a god, and performed as emperor innumerable acts of tyranny; and he describes further the miseries of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> under him, and gives a report of the embassy upon which he himself was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in behalf of his fellow-countrymen in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>;  how when he appeared before Caius in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of his fathers he received nothing but laughter and ridicule, and almost incurred the risk of his life.</p>

<p>2. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> also makes mention of these things in the eighteenth book of his Antiquities, in the following words:  A sedition having arisen in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> between the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that dwell there and the Greeks,  three deputies were chosen from each faction and went to Caius.</p>

<p>3. One of the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> deputies was Apion,  who uttered many <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; among other things saying that they neglected the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> due to C&aelig;sar. For while all other subjects of Rome erected altars and <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> to Caius, and in all other respects treated him just as they did the gods, they alone considered it disgraceful to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> him with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and to swear by his name.</p>

<p>4. And when Apion had uttered many severe charges by which he hoped that Caius would be aroused, as indeed was likely, <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, the chief of the Jewish embassy, a man celebrated in every respect, a brother of Alexander the Alabarch,  and not unskilled in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, was prepared to enter upon a defense in reply to his accusations.</p>

<p>5. But Caius prevented him and ordered him to leave, and being very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, it was plain that he meditated some severe measure against them. And <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> departed covered with insult and told the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were with him to be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>; for while Caius was raging against them he was in fact already contending with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>6. Thus far <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>. And <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> himself, in the work <em>On the Embassy</em> which he wrote, describes accurately and in detail the things which were done by him at that time. But I shall omit the most of them and record only those things which will make clearly evident to the reader that the misfortunes of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> came upon them not long after their daring deeds against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and on account of the same.</p>

<p>7. And in the first place he relates that at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the reign of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, Sejanus, who at that time enjoyed great influence with the emperor, made every effort to destroy the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish nation</a> utterly;  and that in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, under whom the crimes against the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> were committed, attempted something contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish law</a> in respect to the temple, which was at that time still standing in Jerusalem, and excited them to the greatest tumults. </p>

<h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6. The Misfortunes which overwhelmed the Jews after their Presumption against Christ.</h2>

<p>1. After the death of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, Caius received the empire, and, besides innumerable other acts of tyranny against many people, he greatly afflicted especially the whole nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.  These things we may learn briefly from the words of <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, who writes as follows: </p>

<p>2. <q>So great was the caprice of Caius in his conduct toward all, and especially toward the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The latter he so bitterly <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> that he appropriated to himself their places of worship in the other cities,  and beginning with Alexandria he filled them with images and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of himself (for in permitting others to erect them he really erected them himself). The temple in the holy city, which had hitherto been left untouched, and had been regarded as an inviolable asylum, he altered and transformed into a temple of his own, that it might be called the temple of the visible Jupiter, the younger Caius.</q> </p>

<p>3. Innumerable other terrible and almost indescribable calamities which came upon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> during the reign of the same emperor, are recorded by the <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">same author</a> in a second work, to which he gave the title,  <em>On the Virtues</em>.  With him agrees also <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, who likewise indicates that the misfortunes of the whole nation began with the time of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and with their daring crimes against the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. </p>

<p>4. Hear what he says in the second book of his Jewish War, where he writes as follows:  <q><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> being sent to <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> as <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> by <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, secretly carried veiled images of the emperor, called ensigns,  to Jerusalem by night. The following day this caused the greatest disturbance among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For those who were near were confounded at the sight, beholding their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, as it were, trampled under foot. For they allow no image to be set up in their city.</q></p>

<p>5. Comparing these things with the writings of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, you will see that it was not long before there came upon them the penalty for the exclamation which they had uttered under the same <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, when they cried out that they had no other king than <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">C&aelig;sar</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note250318"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;19:15</a></span> </p>

<p>6. The same writer further records that after this another calamity overtook them. He writes as follows:  After this he stirred up another tumult by making use of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> treasure, which is called Corban,  in the construction of an aqueduct three hundred stadia in length. </p>

<p>7. The multitude were greatly displeased at it, and when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> was in Jerusalem they surrounded his tribunal and gave utterance to loud complaints. But he, anticipating the tumult, had distributed through the crowd armed soldiers disguised in citizen's clothing, forbidding them to use the sword, but commanding them to strike with clubs those who should make an outcry. To them he now gave the preconcerted signal from the tribunal. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> being beaten, many of them perished in consequence of the blows, while many others were trampled under foot by their own countrymen in their flight, and thus lost their lives. But the multitude, overawed by the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of those who were slain, held their peace.</p>

<p>8. In addition to these the <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">same author</a> records  many other tumults which were stirred up in Jerusalem itself, and shows that from that time seditions and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and mischievous plots followed each other in quick succession, and never ceased in the city and in all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> until finally the siege of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> overwhelmed them. Thus the divine vengeance overtook the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for the crimes which they dared to commit against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7. Pilate's Suicide.</h2>

<p>It is worthy of note that <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> himself, who was governor in the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, is reported to have fallen into such misfortunes under Caius, whose times we are recording, that he was forced to become <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">his own murderer and executioner</a>;  and thus divine vengeance, as it seems, was not long in overtaking him. This is stated by those Greek historians who have recorded the Olympiads, together with the respective events which have taken place in each period. </p>

<h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8. The Famine which took Place in the Reign of Claudius.</h2>

<p>1. Caius had held the power not quite four years,  when he was succeeded by the emperor Claudius. Under him the world was visited with a famine,  which writers that are entire strangers to our religion have recorded in their histories.  And thus the prediction of <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a> recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, <span class="stiki" id="note250328"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;11:28</a></span> according to which the whole world was to be visited by a famine, received its fulfillment.</p>

<p>2. And Luke, in the Acts, after mentioning the famine in the time of Claudius, and stating that the brethren of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, each according to his ability, sent to the brethren of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> by the hands of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note250329"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse29">Acts&nbsp;11:29-30</a></span> adds the following account.</p>

<h2 id="chapter9">Chapter 9. The Martyrdom of James the Apostle.</h2>

<p>1. <q> <span class="stiki" id="note250330"><a href="../bible/act012.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;12:1-2</a></span> Now about that time</q> (it is clear that he means the time of Claudius) <q><a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the King</a>  stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</q></p>

<p>2. And concerning this James, Clement, in the seventh book of his Hypotyposes,  relates a story which is worthy of mention; telling it as he received it from those who had lived before him. He says that the one who led James to the judgment-seat, when he saw him bearing his testimony, was moved, and confessed that he was himself also a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</p>

<p>3. They were both therefore, he says, led away together; and on the way he begged James to forgive him. And he, after considering a little, said, <q>Peace be with you,</q> and kissed him. And thus they were both beheaded at the same time.</p>

<p>4. And then, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> says, <span class="stiki" id="note250333"><a href="../bible/act012.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;12:3</a>sqq</span> <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, upon the death of James, seeing that the deed pleased the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, attacked Peter also and committed him to prison, and would have slain him if he had not, by the divine appearance of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who came to him by night, been wonderfully released from his bonds, and thus liberated for the service of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Such was the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect to Peter.</p>

<h2 id="chapter10">Chapter 10. Agrippa, who was also called Herod, having persecuted the Apostles, immediately experienced the Divine Vengeance.</h2>

<p>1. The consequences of the king's undertaking against the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were not long deferred, but the avenging minister of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">divine justice</a> overtook him immediately after his plots against them, as the Book of Acts records.  For when he had journeyed to C&aelig;sarea, on a notable feast-day, clothed in a splendid and royal garment, he delivered an address to the people from a lofty throne in front of the tribunal. And when all the multitude applauded the speech, as if it were the voice of a god and not of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> relates that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> smote him, and being eaten of worms he gave up the ghost. <span class="stiki" id="note250335"><a href="../bible/act012.htm#verse23">Acts&nbsp;12:23</a></span> </p>

<p>2. We must admire the account of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> for its agreement with the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> in regard to this wonderful event; for he clearly bears witness to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the nineteenth book of his Antiquities, where he relates the wonder in the following words: </p>

<p>3. He had completed the third year of his reign over all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>  when he came to C&aelig;sarea, which was formerly called Strato's Tower.  There he held games in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of C&aelig;sar, learning that this was a festival observed in behalf of C&aelig;sar's safety.  At this festival was collected a great multitude of the highest and most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> men in the province.</p>

<p>4. And on the second day of the games he proceeded to the theater at break of day, wearing a garment entirely of silver and of wonderful texture. And there the silver, illuminated by the reflection of the sun's earliest rays, shone marvelously, gleaming so brightly as to produce a sort of fear and terror in those who gazed upon him.</p>

<p>5. And immediately his flatterers, some from one place, others from another, raised up their voices in a way that was not for his good, calling him a god, and saying, 'Be merciful; if up to this time we have feared you as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, henceforth we confess that you are superior to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of mortals.'</p>

<p>6. The king did not rebuke them, nor did he reject their impious flattery. But after a little, looking up, he saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sitting above his head.  And this he quickly perceived would be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as it had once been the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of good fortune,  and he was smitten with a heart-piercing pain.</p>

<p>7. And straightway distress, beginning with the greatest <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, seized his bowels. And looking upon his friends he said, 'I, your god, am now commanded to depart this life; and <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> thus on the spot disproves the <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> words you have just uttered concerning me. He who has been called <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> by you is now led away to die; but our destiny must be accepted as God has determined it. For we have passed our life by no means ingloriously, but in that splendor which is called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.' </p>

<p>8. And when he had said this he labored with an increase of pain. He was accordingly carried in haste to the palace, while the report spread among all that the king would undoubtedly soon die. But the multitude, with their wives and children, sitting on sackcloth after the custom of their fathers, implored God in behalf of the king, and every place was filled with lamentation and tears.  And the king as he lay in a lofty chamber, and saw them below lying prostrate on the ground, could not refrain from weeping himself.</p>

<p>9. And after suffering continually for five days with pain in the bowels, he departed this life, in the fifty-fourth year of his age, and in the seventh year of his reign.  Four years he ruled under the Emperor Caius&mdash; three of them over the tetrarchy of Philip, to which was added in the fourth year that of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> &mdash; and three years during the reign of the Emperor Claudius.</p>

<p>10. I marvel greatly that <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, in these things as well as in others, so fully agrees with the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>. But if there should seem to any one to be a disagreement in respect to the name of the king, the time at least and the events show that the same person is meant, whether the change of name has been caused by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of a copyist, or is due to the fact that he, like so many, bore two names. </p>

<h2 id="chapter11">Chapter 11. The Impostor Theudas and his Followers.</h2>

<p>1. Luke, in the Acts, introduces <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a> as saying, at the consultation which was held concerning the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that at the time referred to,  <q>rose up Theudas boasting himself to be somebody; who was slain; and all, as many as <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> him, were scattered.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250348"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse36">Acts&nbsp;5:36</a></span> Let us therefore add the account of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> concerning this man. He records in the work mentioned just above, the following circumstances: </p>

<p>2. While Fadus was <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>  a certain <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> called Theudas  persuaded a very great multitude to take their possessions and follow him to the river Jordan. For he said that he was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and that the river should be divided at his command, and afford them an easy passage.</p>

<p>3. And with these words he deceived many. But Fadus did not permit them to enjoy their folly, but sent a troop of horsemen against them, who fell upon them unexpectedly and slew many of them and took many others alive, while they took Theudas himself captive, and cut off his head and carried it to Jerusalem. Besides this he also makes mention of the famine, which took place in the reign of Claudius, in the following words.</p>

<h2 id="chapter12">Chapter 12. Helen, the Queen of the Osrh&oelig;nians.</h2>

<p>1. <q>And at this time  it came to pass that the great famine  took place in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, in which the queen Helen,  having purchased grain from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with large sums, distributed it to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy</a>.</q></p>

<p>2. You will find this statement also in agreement with the Acts of the Apostles, where it is said that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <q>each according to his ability, determined to send <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">relief</a> to the brethren that dwelt in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>; which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</q> </p>

<p>3. But splendid monuments  of this Helen, of whom the historian has made mention, are still shown in the suburbs of the city which is now called <a href="../cathen/08355a.htm">&AElig;lia</a>.  But she is said to have been queen of the Adiabeni. </p>

<h2 id="chapter13">Chapter 13. Simon Magus.</h2> 

<p>1. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ</a> having now been diffused among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,  the enemy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> contrived a plan for seizing the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">imperial city</a> for himself. He conducted there the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a>,  aided him in his deceitful arts, led many of the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> astray, and thus brought them into his own power.</p>

<p>2. This is stated by Justin,  one of our distinguished writers who lived not long after the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Concerning him I shall speak in the proper place.  Take and read the work of this man, who in the first Apology  which he addressed to <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antonine</a> in behalf of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">our religion</a> writes as follows: </p>

<p>3. And after the ascension of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> into heaven the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> put forward certain men who said they were gods, and who were not only allowed by you to go unpersecuted, but were even deemed worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>. One of them was <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> of the village of Gitto,  who in the reign of Claudius C&aelig;sar  performed in your <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">imperial city</a> some mighty acts of magic by the art of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> operating in him, and was considered a god, and as a god was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by you with a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, which was erected in the river Tiber,  between the two bridges, and bore this inscription in the Latin tongue, <em>Simoni Deo Sancto</em>, that is, <em>To Simon the Holy God.</em> </p>

<p>4. And nearly all the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> and a few even of other nations confess and worship him as the first God. And there went around with him at that time a certain Helena  who had formerly been a prostitute in <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>; and her they call the first idea that proceeded from him. </p>

<p>5. Justin relates these things, and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> also agrees with him in the first book of his work, Against Heresies, where he gives an account of the man  and of his profane and impure teaching. It would be superfluous to quote his account here, for it is possible for those who wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the origin and the lives and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> of each of the heresiarchs that have followed him, as well as the customs practiced by them all, to find them treated at length in the above-mentioned work of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>.</p>

<p>6. We have understood that <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a> was the author of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.  From his time down to the present those who have followed his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> have feigned the sober <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, which is celebrated among all on account of its purity of life. But they nevertheless have embraced again the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, which they seemed to have renounced; and they fall down before pictures and images of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a> himself and of the above-mentioned Helena who was with him; and they venture to worship them with <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and libations.</p>

<p>7. But those matters which they keep more secret than these, in regard to which they say that one upon first hearing them would be astonished, and, to use one of the written phrases in vogue among them, would be confounded,  are in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> full of amazing things, and of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and folly, being of such a sort that it is impossible not only to commit them to writing, but also for modest men even to utter them with the lips on account of their excessive baseness and lewdness. </p>

<p>8. For whatever could be conceived of, viler than the vilest thing&mdash; all that has been outdone by this most abominable <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, which is composed of those who make a sport of those miserable <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> that are literally overwhelmed with all kinds of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. </p>

<h2 id="chapter14">Chapter 14. The Preaching of the Apostle Peter in Rome.</h2>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">evil power</a>,  who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> all that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and plots against the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, constituted <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a> at that time the father and author of such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>,  as if to make him a mighty antagonist of the great, inspired <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>.</p>

<p>2. For that divine and celestial <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which co-operates with its ministers, by their appearance and presence, quickly extinguished the kindled flame of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and humbled and cast down through them <q>every high thing that exalted itself against the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250380"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:5</a></span> </p>

<p>3. Wherefore neither the conspiracy of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a> nor that of any of the others who arose at that period could accomplish anything in those <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostolic</a> times. For everything was conquered and subdued by the splendors of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">divine word</a> itself which had but lately begun to shine from heaven upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and which was then flourishing upon earth, and dwelling in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves.</p>

<p>4. Immediately  the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> was smitten in the eyes of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> by a divine and miraculous flash, and after the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> done by him had been first detected by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>,  he fled and made a great journey across the sea from the East to the West, thinking that only thus could he live according to his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.</p>

<p>5. And coming to the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>,  by the mighty co-operation of that power which was lying in wait there, he was in a short time so successful in his undertaking that those who dwelt there <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> him as a god by the erection of a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>. </p>

<p>6. But this did not last long. For immediately, during the reign of Claudius, the all-good and gracious Providence, which watches over all things, led Peter, that strongest and greatest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and the one who on account of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was the speaker for all the others, to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>  against this great corrupter of life. He like a noble commander of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, clad in divine armor, carried the costly merchandise of the light of the understanding from the East to those who dwelt in the West, proclaiming the light itself, and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a> which brings <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and preaching the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. </p>

<h2 id="chapter15">Chapter 15. The Gospel according to Mark.</h2>

<p>1. And thus when the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">divine word</a> had made its home among them,  the power of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a> was quenched and immediately destroyed, together with the man himself.  And so greatly did the splendor of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> illumine the minds of Peter's hearers that they were not satisfied with hearing once only, and were not content with the unwritten teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">divine Gospel</a>, but with all sorts of entreaties they besought <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark</a>,  a follower of Peter, and the one whose <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">Gospel</a> is extant, that he would leave them a written monument of the doctrine which had been orally communicated to them. Nor did they cease until they had prevailed with the man, and had thus become the occasion of the written <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">Gospel</a> which bears the name of <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark</a>. </p>

<p>2. And they say that Peter &mdash; when he had learned, through a revelation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, of that which had been done &mdash; was pleased with the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the men, and that the work obtained the sanction of his authority for the purpose of being used in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>.  Clement in the eighth book of his Hypotyposes gives this account, and with him agrees the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Hierapolis named <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a>.  And Peter makes mention of <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark</a> in his <a href="../bible/1pe000.htm">first epistle</a> which they say that he wrote in Rome itself, as is indicated by him, when he calls the city, by a figure, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, as he does in the following words: <q>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> that is at <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Marcus</a> my son.</q> </p>

<h2 id="chapter16">Chapter 16. Mark first proclaimed Christianity to the Inhabitants of Egypt.</h2>

<p>1. And they say that this <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark</a> was the first that was sent to <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">Egypt</a>, and that he proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which he had written, and first established <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>. </p>

<p>2. And the multitude of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, that were collected there at the very outset, and lived lives of the most <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and excessive <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>, was so great, that <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> thought it worth while to describe their pursuits, their meetings, their entertainments, and their whole manner of life. </p>

<h2 id="chapter17">Chapter 17. Philo's Account of the Ascetics of Egypt.</h2>

<p>1. It is also said that <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> in the reign of Claudius became acquainted at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with Peter, who was then preaching there.  Nor is this indeed improbable, for the work of which we have spoken, and which was composed by him some years later, clearly contains those rules of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which are even to this day observed among us.</p>

<p>2. And since he describes as accurately as possible the life of our <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetics</a>, it is clear that he not only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, but that he also approved, while he venerated and extolled, the apostolic men of his time, who were as it seems of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Hebrew race</a>, and hence observed, after the manner of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the most of the customs of the ancients.</p>

<p>3. In the work to which he gave the title, <em>On a Contemplative Life or on Suppliants</em>,  after affirming in the first place that he will add to those things which he is about to relate nothing contrary to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or of his own invention,  he says that these men were called Therapeut&aelig; and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that were with them Therapeutrides.  He then adds the reasons for such a name, explaining it from the fact that they applied remedies and healed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those who came to them, by relieving them like physicians, of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, or from the fact that they served and worshipped the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Deity</a> in purity and sincerity.</p>

<p>4. Whether <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> himself gave them this name, employing an epithet well suited to their mode of life, or whether the first of them really called themselves so in the beginning, since the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was not yet everywhere <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, we need not discuss here.</p>

<p>5. He bears witness, however, that first of all they <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">renounce their property</a>. When they begin the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>  mode of life, he says, they give up their goods to their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, and then, renouncing all the cares of life, they go forth beyond the walls and dwell in lonely fields and gardens, knowing well that intercourse with people of a different <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> is unprofitable and harmful. They did this at that time, as seems probable, under the influence of a spirited and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">ardent</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, practicing in emulation the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets'</a> mode of life.</p>

<p>6. For in the Acts of the Apostles, a work universally acknowledged as authentic,  it is recorded that all the companions of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> sold their possessions and their property and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">distributed</a> to all according to the necessity of each one, so that no one among them was in <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">want</a>. <q>For as many as were possessors of lands or houses,</q> as the account says, <q>sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them at the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> feet, so that <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">distribution</a> was made unto every man according as he had <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">need</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250402"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse45">Acts&nbsp;2:45</a></span> </p>

<p>7. <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> bears witness to facts very much like those here described and then adds the following account:  Everywhere in the world is this race  found. For it was fitting that both Greek  and Barbarian should share in what is <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfectly good</a>. But the race particularly abounds in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in each of its so-called <em>nomes</em>,  and especially about <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>.</p>

<p>8. The best men from every quarter emigrate, as if to a colony of the Therapeut&aelig;'s fatherland,  to a certain very suitable spot which lies above the Lake Maria  upon a low hill excellently situated on account of its security and the mildness of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>9. And then a little further on, after describing the kind of houses which they had, he speaks as follows concerning their <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, which were scattered about here and there:  <q>In each house there is a sacred apartment which is called a sanctuary and monastery,  where, quite alone, they perform the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the religious life. They bring nothing into it, neither drink nor food, nor any of the other things which contribute to the necessities of the body, but only the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and the inspired oracles of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and such other things as augment and make <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.</q></p>

<p>10. And after some other matters he says: </p>

<p>The whole interval, from morning to evening, is for them a time of exercise. For they read the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, and explain the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of their fathers in an allegorical manner, regarding the written words as <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">hidden truth</a> which is communicated in obscure figures.</p>

<p>11. They have also writings of ancient men, who were the founders of their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, and who left many monuments of the allegorical method. These they use as models, and imitate their principles.</p>

<p>12. These things seem to have been stated by a man who had heard them expounding their <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred writings</a>. But it is highly probable that the works of the ancients, which he says they had, were the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and the writings of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and probably some expositions of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, such as are contained in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and in many others of Paul's Epistles.</p>

<p>13. Then again he writes as follows concerning the new <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">psalms</a> which they composed:  <q>So that they not only spend their time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">meditation</a>, but they also compose songs and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in every variety of metre and melody, though they divide them, of course, into measures of more than common <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>.</q></p>

<p>14. The same book contains an account of many other things, but it seemed necessary to select those facts which exhibit the characteristics of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> mode of life.</p>

<p>15. But if any one thinks that what has been said is not peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> polity, but that it can be applied to others besides those mentioned, let him be convinced by the subsequent words of the same author, in which, if he is unprejudiced, he will find undisputed testimony on this subject. <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo's</a> words are as follows: </p>

<p>16. Having laid down <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> as a sort of foundation in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, they build upon it the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. None of them may take food or drink before sunset, since they regard <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a> as a work worthy of the light, but attention to the wants of the body as proper only in the darkness, and therefore assign the day to the former, but to the latter a small portion of the night.</p>

<p>17. But some, in whom a great desire for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> dwells, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">forget to take food</a> for three days; and some are so delighted and feast so luxuriously upon wisdom, which furnishes doctrines richly and without stint, that they <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">abstain</a> even twice as long as this, and are accustomed, after six days, scarcely to take necessary food. These statements of <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> we regard as referring clearly and indisputably to those of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">our communion</a>.</p>

<p>18. But if after these things any one still obstinately persists in denying the reference, let him renounce his incredulity and be convinced by yet more striking examples, which are to be found nowhere else than in the evangelical religion of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. </p>

<p>19. For they say that there were <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also with those of whom we are speaking, and that the most of them were aged <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>  who had preserved their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, not out of necessity, as some of the priestesses among the Greeks,  but rather by their own choice, through <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and a desire for wisdom. And that in their earnest desire to live with it as their companion they paid no attention to the pleasures of the body, seeking not mortal but <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> progeny, which only the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is able to bear of itself.</p>

<p>20. Then after a little he adds still more emphatically:  <q>They expound the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> figuratively by means of allegories. For the whole law seems to these men to resemble a living organism, of which the spoken words constitute the body, while the hidden sense stored up within the words constitutes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This hidden meaning has first been particularly studied by this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, which sees, revealed as in a mirror of names, the surpassing beauties of the thoughts.</q></p>

<p>21. Why is it necessary to add to these things their meetings and the respective occupations of the men and of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> during those meetings, and the practices which are even to the present day <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> observed by us, especially such as we are accustomed to observe at the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">feast of the Saviour's passion</a>, with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">night watching</a> and study of the divine Word.</p>

<p>22. These things the above-mentioned author has related in his own work, indicating a mode of life which has been preserved to the present time by us alone, recording especially the <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> kept in connection with the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">great festival</a>, and the exercises performed during those <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> customarily recited by us, and describing how, while one <a href="../cathen/14140c.htm">sings</a> regularly in time, the others listen in silence, and join in chanting only the close of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>; and how, on the <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">days referred to</a> they sleep on the ground on beds of straw, and to use his own words,  <q>taste no wine at all, nor any <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">flesh</a>, but water is their only drink, and the reish with their bread is <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> and <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a>.</q></p>

<p>23. In addition to this <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> describes the order of dignities which exists among those who carry on the services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, mentioning the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, and the office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, which takes the precedence over all the others.  But whosoever desires a more accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these matters may get it from the history already cited.</p>

<p>24. But that <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, when he wrote these things, had in view the first heralds of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the customs handed down from the beginning by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, is clear to every one.</p>

<h2 id="chapter18">Chapter 18. The Works of Philo that have come down to us.</h2>

<p>1. Copious in language, comprehensive in thought, sublime and elevated in his views of <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>, <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> has produced manifold and various expositions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred books</a>. On the one hand, he expounds in order the events recorded in Genesis in the books to which he gives the title <em>Allegories of the Sacred Laws</em>;  on the other hand, he makes successive divisions of the chapters in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which are the subject of investigation, and gives objections and solutions, in the books which he quite suitably calls <em>Questions and Answers on Genesis and Exodus</em>. </p>

<p>2. There are, besides these, treatises expressly worked out by him on certain subjects, such as the two books  <em>On Agriculture</em>,  and the same number <em>On Drunkenness</em>;  and some others distinguished by different titles corresponding to the contents of each; for instance, <em>Concerning the Things Which the Sober Mind Desires and Execrates</em>,  <em>On the Confusion of Tongues</em>,  <em>On Flight and Discovery</em>,  <em>On Assembly for the Sake of Instruction</em>,  <em>On the Question, 'Who is Heir to Things Divine?'</em> or <em>On the Division of Things into Equal and Unequal</em>, and still further the work <em>On the Three Virtues Which With Others Have Been Described by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</em> </p>

<p>3. In addition to these is the work <em>On Those Whose Names Have Been Changed and Why They Have Been Changed</em>, in which he says that he had written also two books <em>On Covenants.</em> </p>

<p>4. And there is also a work of his <em>On Emigration</em>, and one <em>On the Life of a Wise Man Made Perfect in Righteousness</em>, or <em>On Unwritten Laws;</em> and still further the work <em>On Giants</em> or <em>On the Immutability of God</em>, and a first, second, third, fourth and fifth book <em>On the Proposition, That Dreams According to Moses are Sent by God.</em>  These are the books on Genesis that have come down to us.</p>

<p>5. But on Exodus we are acquainted with the first, second, third, fourth and fifth books of <em>Questions and Answers;</em>  also with that <em>On the Tabernacle</em>,  and that <em>On the Ten Commandments</em>,  and the four books  <em>On the Laws Which Refer Especially to the Principal Divisions of the Ten Commandments</em>, and another <em>On Animals Intended for Sacrifice</em> and <em>On the Kinds of Sacrifice</em>, and another <em>On the Rewards Fixed in the Law for the Good, and on the Punishments and Curses Fixed for the Wicked.</em> </p>

<p>6. In addition to all these there are extant also some single-volumed works of his; as for instance, the work <em>On Providence</em>, and the book composed by him <em>On the Jews</em>,  and <em>The Statesman</em>; and still further, <em>Alexander</em>, or <em>On the Possession of Reason by the Irrational Animals.</em>  Besides these there is a work <em>On the Proposition that Every Wicked Man is a Slave</em>, to which is subjoined the work <em>On the Proposition that Every Good Man is Free.</em> </p>

<p>7. After these was composed by him the work <em>On the Contemplative Life</em>, or <em>On Suppliants</em>, from which we have drawn the facts concerning the life of the apostolic men; and still further, the <em>Interpretation of the Hebrew Names in the Law and in the Prophets</em> are said to be the result of his industry. </p>

<p>8. And he is said to have read in the presence of the whole Roman Senate during the reign of Claudius  the work which he had written, when he came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under Caius, concerning Caius' <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the gods, and to which, with ironical reference to its character, he had given the title <em>On the Virtues</em>.  And his discourses were so much admired as to be deemed worthy of a place in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>.</p>

<p>9. At this time, while Paul was completing his journey <q>from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250452"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;15:19</a></span> Claudius drove the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> out of Rome; and <a href="../cathen/01661b.htm">Aquila and Priscilla</a>, leaving Rome with the other <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, came to Asia, and there abode with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who was confirming the churches of that region whose foundations he had newly laid. The sacred book of the Acts informs us also of these things. </p>

<h2 id="chapter19">Chapter 19. The Calamity which befell the Jews in Jerusalem on the Day of the Passover.</h2>

<p>1. While Claudius was still emperor, it happened that so great a tumult and disturbance took place in Jerusalem at the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of the Passover</a>, that thirty thousand of those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> alone who were forcibly crowded together at the gate of the temple perished,  being trampled under foot by one another. Thus the festival became a season of mourning for all the nation, and there was weeping in every house. These things are related literally  by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>.</p>

<p>2. But Claudius appointed Agrippa,  son of Agrippa, king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, having sent Felix  as <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the whole country of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> and <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and of the land called Perea.  And after he had reigned thirteen years and eight months  he died, and left <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> as his successor in the empire.</p>

<h2 id="chapter20">Chapter 20. The Events which took Place in Jerusalem during the Reign of Nero.</h2>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> again, in the twentieth book of his Antiquities, relates the quarrel which arose among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> during the reign of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, while Felix was <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.</p>

<p>2. His words are as follows : There arose a quarrel between the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> on the one hand and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and leaders of the people of Jerusalem on the other.  And each of them collected a body of the boldest and most restless men, and put himself at their head, and whenever they met they hurled invectives and stones at each other. And there was no one that would interpose; but these things were done at will as if in a city <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">destitute of a ruler</a>.</p>

<p>3. And so great was the shamelessness and audacity of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> that they dared to send their servants to the threshing-floors to seize the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> due to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; and thus those of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that were poor were seen to be perishing of want. In this way did the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the factions prevail over all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</p>

<p>4. And the <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">same author</a> again relates that about the same time there sprang up in Jerusalem a certain kind of robbers,  <q>who by day,</q> as he says, <q>and in the middle of the city slew those who met them.</q></p>

<p>5. For, especially at the feasts, they mingled with the multitude, and with short swords, which they concealed under their garments, they stabbed the most distinguished men. And when they fell, the murderers themselves were among those who expressed their indignation. And thus on account of the confidence which was reposed in them by all, they remained undiscovered.</p>

<p>6. The first that was slain by them was Jonathan the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>;  and after him many were killed every day, until the fear became worse than the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> itself, each one, as in battle, hourly expecting death.</p>

<h2 id="chapter21">Chapter 21. The Egyptian, who is mentioned also in the Acts of the Apostles.</h2>

<p>1. After other matters he proceeds as follows:  But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were afflicted with a greater plague than these by the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a>.  For there appeared in the land an <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> who aroused faith in himself as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and collected about thirty thousand of those whom he had deceived, and led them from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to the so-called <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a> whence he was prepared to enter Jerusalem by force and to overpower the Roman garrison and seize the government of the people, using those who made the attack with him as body guards.</p>

<p>2. But Felix anticipated his attack, and went out to meet him with the Roman legionaries, and all the people joined in the defense, so that when the battle was fought the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> fled with a few followers, but the most of them were destroyed or taken captive.</p>

<p>3. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> relates these events in the second book of his History.  But it is worth while comparing the account of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> given here with that contained in the Acts of the Apostles. In the time of Felix it was said to Paul by the centurion in Jerusalem, when the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> raised a disturbance against the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, <q>Are you not he who before these days made an uproar, and led out into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> four thousand men that were murderers?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250467"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse38">Acts&nbsp;21:38</a></span> These are the events which took place in the time of Felix. </p>

<h2 id="chapter22">Chapter 22. Paul having been sent bound from Judea to Rome, made his Defense, and was acquitted of every Charge.</h2>

<p>1. Festus  was sent by <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> to be Felix's successor. Under him Paul, having made his defense, was sent bound to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.  Aristarchus was with him, whom he also somewhere in his epistles quite naturally calls his fellow-prisoner. <span class="stiki" id="note250471"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse10">Colossians&nbsp;4:10</a></span> And Luke, who wrote the Acts of the Apostles,  brought his history to a close at this point, after stating that Paul spent two whole years at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a prisoner at large, and preached the word of God without restraint. </p>

<p>2. Thus after he had made his defense it is said that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> was sent again upon the ministry of preaching,  and that upon coming to the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">same city</a> a second time he suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.  In this imprisonment he wrote his <a href="../bible/2ti000.htm">second epistle to Timothy</a>,  in which he mentions his first defense and his impending death.</p>

<p>3. But hear his testimony on these matters: <q>At my first answer,</q> he says, <q>no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stood with me, but all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> forsook me: I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that it may not be laid to their charge. Notwithstanding the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and that all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250477"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:16-17</a></span> </p>

<p>4. He plainly indicates in these words that on the former occasion, in order that the preaching might be fulfilled by him, he was rescued from the mouth of the lion, referring, in this expression, to <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, as is probable on account of the latter's cruelty. He did not therefore afterward add the similar statement, <q>He will rescue me from the mouth of the lion</q>; for he saw in the spirit that his end would not be long delayed.</p>

<p>5. Wherefore he adds to the words, <q>And he delivered me from the mouth of the lion,</q> this sentence: <q>The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> shall deliver me from every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250478"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:18</a></span> indicating his speedy <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>; which he also foretells still more clearly in the same epistle, when he writes, <q>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</q> </p>

<p>6. In his second epistle to Timothy, moreover, he indicates that Luke was with him when he wrote,  but at his first defense not even he.  Whence it is probable that Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles at that time, continuing his history down to the period when he was with Paul. </p>

<p>7. But these things have been adduced by us to show that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> did not take place at the time of that Roman sojourn which Luke records.</p>

<p>8. It is probable indeed that as <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> was more disposed to mildness in the beginning, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">defense</a> of his doctrine was more easily received; but that when he had advanced to the commission of lawless deeds of daring, he made the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> as well as others the subjects of his attacks. </p>

<h2 id="chapter23">Chapter 23. The Martyrdom of James, who was called the Brother of the Lord.</h2>

<p>1. But after <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in consequence of his appeal to C&aelig;sar, had been sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Festus, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, being frustrated in their hope of entrapping him by the snares which they had laid for him, turned against James, the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>,  to whom the episcopal seat at Jerusalem had been entrusted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.  The following daring measures were undertaken by them against him.</p>

<p>2. Leading him into their midst they demanded of him that he should renounce <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the presence of all the people. But, contrary to the opinion of all, with a clear voice, and with greater boldness than they had anticipated, he spoke out before the whole multitude and confessed that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour and Lord Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But they were unable to bear longer the testimony of the man who, on account of the excellence of <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>  and of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which he exhibited in his life, was esteemed by all as the most just of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and consequently they slew him. Opportunity for this deed of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> was furnished by the prevailing <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, which was caused by the fact that Festus had died just at this time in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and that the province was thus without a governor and head. </p>

<p>3. The manner of James' death has been already indicated by the above-quoted words of Clement, who records that he was thrown from the pinnacle of the temple, and was beaten to death with a club.  But <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a>,  who lived immediately after the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, gives the most accurate account in the fifth book of his Memoirs.  He writes as follows:</p>

<p>4. James, the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>, succeeded to the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in conjunction with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.  He has been called the Just  by all from the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> to the present day; for there were many that bore the name of James.</p>

<p>5. He was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> from his mother's womb; and he drank no wine nor strong drink, nor did he <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">eat flesh</a>. No razor came upon his <a href="../cathen/07113a.htm">head</a>; he did not anoint himself with oil, and he did not use the bath.</p>

<p>6. He alone was permitted to enter into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place; for he wore not woolen but linen garments. And he was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of entering alone into the temple, and was frequently found <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">upon his knees</a> begging forgiveness for the people, so that his knees became hard like those of a camel, in consequence of his constantly <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">bending them</a> in his worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and asking forgiveness for the people. </p>

<p>7. Because of his exceeding great <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> he was called the Just, and Oblias,  which signifies in Greek, 'Bulwark of the people' and 'Justice,'  in accordance with what the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> declare concerning him. </p>

<p>8. Now some of the seven <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> among the people and which have been mentioned by me in the Memoirs,  asked him, 'What is the gate of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>?'  and he replied that he was the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>.</p>

<p>9. On account of these words some <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> mentioned above did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> either in a resurrection or in one's coming to <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">give to every man according to his works</a>.  But as many as <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> did so on account of James.</p>

<p>10. Therefore when many even of the rulers <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, there was a commotion among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who said that there was danger that the whole people would be looking for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>. Coming therefore in a body to James they said, 'We entreat you, restrain the people; for they are gone astray in regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, as if he were the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>.  We entreat you to persuade all that have come to the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of the Passover</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>; for we all have confidence in you. For we bear you witness, as do all the people, that you are just, and do not respect <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note250501"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;22:16</a></span> </p>

<p>11. Therefore, persuade the multitude not to be led astray concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. For the whole people, and all of us also, have confidence in you. Stand therefore upon the pinnacle of the temple,  that from that high position you may be clearly seen, and that your words may be readily heard by all the people. For all the tribes, with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also, have come together on account of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>.'</p>

<p>12. The aforesaid <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> therefore placed James upon the pinnacle of the temple, and cried out to him and said: 'You just one, in whom we ought all to have confidence, forasmuch as the people are led astray after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the crucified one, declare to us, what is the gate of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.' </p>

<p>13. And he answered with a loud voice, 'Why do you ask me concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>? He himself sits in heaven at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">great Power</a>, and is about to come upon the clouds of heaven.' </p>

<p>14. And when many were fully convinced and gloried in the testimony of James, and said, '<a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Son of David</a>,' these same <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> said again to one another, 'We have done badly in supplying such testimony to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. But let us go up and throw him down, in order that they may be afraid to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him.'</p>

<p>15. And they cried out, saying, 'Oh! Oh! The just man is also in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.' And they fulfilled the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> written in Isaiah,  'Let us take away  the just man, because he is troublesome to us: therefore they shall eat the fruit of their doings.'</p>

<p>16. So they went up and threw down the <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">just man</a>, and said to each other, 'Let us <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the Just</a>.' And they began to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> him, for he was not killed by the fall; but he turned and <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> down and said, 'I entreat you, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God our Father</a>,  forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.' <span class="stiki" id="note250508"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> </p>

<p>17. And while they were thus <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a> him one of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the sons of <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a>, the son of the <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechabites</a>,  who are mentioned by <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>,  cried out, saying, 'Stop. What are you doing? The <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">just one</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for you.' </p>

<p>18. And one of them, who was a fuller, took the club with which he beat out clothes and struck the <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">just man</a> on the head. And thus he suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.  And they buried him on the spot, by the temple, and his monument still remains by the temple.  He became a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> witness, both to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>. And immediately <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> besieged them. </p>

<p>19. These things are related at length by <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a>, who is in agreement with Clement.  James was so admirable a man and so celebrated among all for his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that the more sensible even of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were of the opinion that this was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the siege of Jerusalem, which happened to them immediately after his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for no other reason than their daring act against him.</p>

<p>20. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, at least, has not hesitated to testify this in his writings, where he says,  <q>These things happened to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to avenge <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the Just</a>, who was a brother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that is called the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> slew him, although he was a most just man.</q></p>

<p>21. And the same writer records his death also in the twentieth book of his Antiquities in the following words:  But the emperor, when he learned of the death of Festus, sent Albinus  to be <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. But the younger Ananus,  who, as we have already said,  had obtained the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>, was of an exceedingly bold and reckless disposition. He belonged, moreover, to the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, who are the most cruel of all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the execution of judgment, as we have already shown. </p>

<p>22. Ananus, therefore, being of this character, and supposing that he had a favorable opportunity on account of the fact that Festus was dead, and Albinus was still on the way, called together the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>, and brought before them the brother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the so-called <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, James by name, together with some others,  and accused them of violating the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, and condemned them to be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>. </p>

<p>23. But those in the city who seemed most moderate and skilled in the law were very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at this, and sent secretly to the king,  requesting him to order Ananus to cease such proceedings. For he had not done right even this first time. And certain of them also went to meet Albinus, who was journeying from <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, and reminded him that it was not lawful for Ananus to summon the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. </p>

<p>24. And Albinus, being persuaded by their representations, wrote in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> to Ananus, threatening him with punishment. And the king, Agrippa, in consequence, deprived him of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>,  which he had held three months, and appointed Jesus, the son of Damn&aelig;us. </p>

<p>25. These things are recorded in regard to James, who is said to be the author of the first of the so-called <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">catholic epistles</a>. But it is to be observed that it is disputed;  at least, not many of the ancients have mentioned it, as is the case likewise with the epistle that bears the name of Jude,  which is also one of the seven so-called <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">catholic epistles</a>. Nevertheless we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these also,  with the rest, have been read publicly in very many <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>. </p>

<h2 id="chapter24">Chapter 24. Annianus the First Bishop of the Church of Alexandria after Mark.</h2>

<p>1. When <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> was in the eighth year of his reign,  Annianus  succeeded <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark the Evangelist</a> in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">parish of Alexandria</a>. </p>

<h2 id="chapter25">Chapter 25. The Persecution under Nero in which Paul and Peter were honored at Rome with Martyrdom in Behalf of Religion.</h2>

<p>1. When the government of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> was now firmly established, he began to plunge into unholy pursuits, and armed himself even against the religion of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.</p>

<p>2. To describe the greatness of his depravity does not lie within the plan of the present work. As there are many indeed that have recorded his history in most accurate narratives,  every one may at his pleasure learn from them the coarseness of the man's extraordinary <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, under the influence of which, after he had accomplished the destruction of so many myriads without any reason, he ran into such blood-guiltiness that he did not spare even his nearest <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> and dearest friends, but destroyed his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">mother</a> and his brothers and his wife,  with very many others of his own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> as he would private and public enemies, with various kinds of deaths.</p>

<p>3. But with all these things this particular in the catalogue of his crimes was still wanting, that he was the first of the emperors who showed himself an enemy of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">divine religion</a>.</p>

<p>4. The Roman <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> is likewise a witness of this. He writes as follows:  <q>Examine your records. There you will find that <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> was the first that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> this doctrine,  particularly then when after subduing all the east, he exercised his cruelty against all at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.  We <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in having such a man the leader in our punishment. For whoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> him can understand that nothing was condemned by <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> unless it was something of great excellence.</q></p>

<p>5. Thus publicly announcing himself as the first among <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> chief enemies, he was led on to the slaughter of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. It is, therefore, recorded that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was beheaded in Rome itself,  and that Peter likewise was crucified under <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>.  This account of Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is substantiated by the fact that their names are preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03510a.htm">cemeteries of that place</a> even to the present day.</p>

<p>6. It is confirmed likewise by Caius,  a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,  who arose  under <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a>,  <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>. He, in a published disputation with Proclus,  the leader of the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Phrygian heresy</a>,  speaks as follows concerning the places where the sacred corpses of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are laid:</p>

<p>7. <q>But  I can show the trophies of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For if you will go to the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a>  or to the Ostian way,  you will find the trophies of those who laid the foundations of this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>.</q> </p>

<p>8. And that they both suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at the same time is stated by <a href="../cathen/05010a.htm">Dionysius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Corinth,  in his epistle to the Romans,  in the following words: <q>You have thus by such an admonition bound together the planting of Peter and of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. For both of them planted and likewise taught us in our <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>.  And they taught together in like manner in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at the same time.</q>  I have quoted these things in order that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the history might be still more confirmed.</p>

<h2 id="chapter26">Chapter 26. The Jews, afflicted with Innumerable Evils, commenced the Last War Against the Romans.</h2>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> again, after relating many things in connection with the calamity which came upon the whole <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish nation</a>, records,  in addition to many other circumstances, that a great many  of the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were scourged in Jerusalem itself and then crucified by Florus.  It happened that he was <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> when the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> began to be kindled, in the twelfth year of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. </p>

<p>2. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> says  that at that time a terrible commotion was stirred up throughout all <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> in consequence of the revolt of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and that everywhere the latter were destroyed without mercy, like enemies, by the inhabitants of the cities, <q>so that one could see cities filled with unburied corpses, and the dead bodies of the aged scattered about with the bodies of infants, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> without even a covering for their nakedness, and the whole province full of indescribable calamities, while the dread of those things that were threatened was greater than the sufferings themselves which they anywhere endured.</q>  Such is the account of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>; and such was the condition of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at that time.</p>
