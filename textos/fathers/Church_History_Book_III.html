<h1>Church History (Book III)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. The Parts of the World in which the Apostles preached Christ.</h2>

<p>1. Such was the condition of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> were <a href="../cathen/05046a.htm">dispersed</a> throughout the world.  Parthia,  according to tradition, was allotted to <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a> as his field of labor, Scythia  to <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a>,  and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>  to <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>,  who, after he had lived some time there,  died at <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>.</p>

<p>2. Peter appears to have preached  in Pontus, Galatia, Bithynia, Cappadocia, and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>  to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">dispersion</a>. And at last, having come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was crucified head-downwards;  for he had requested that he might suffer in this way. What do we need to say concerning <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from Jerusalem to <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>,  and afterwards suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>?  These facts are related by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in the third volume of his Commentary on Genesis. </p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The First Successor to St. Peter in Rome.</h2>

<p>1. After the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and of Peter, Linus  was the first to obtain the episcopate of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> mentions him, when writing to Timothy from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the salutation at the end of the epistle. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. The Epistles of the Apostles.</h2>

<p>1. One epistle of Peter, that called the <a href="../bible/1pe000.htm">first</a>, is acknowledged as genuine.  And this the ancient elders  used freely in their own writings as an undisputed work.  But we have learned that his extant second Epistle does not belong to the canon;  yet, as it has appeared profitable to many, it has been used with the other Scriptures. </p>

<p>2. The so-called Acts of Peter,  however, and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>  which bears his name, and the Preaching  and the Apocalypse,  as they are called, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> have not been universally accepted,  because no <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer, ancient or modern, has made use of testimonies drawn from them. </p>

<p>3. But in the course of my history I shall be careful to show, in addition to the official succession, what <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers have from time to time made use of any of the disputed works,  and what they have said in regard to the canonical and accepted writings,  as well as in regard to those which are not of this class.</p>

<p>4. Such are the writings that bear the name of Peter, only one of which I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be genuine  and acknowledged by the ancient elders. </p>

<p>5. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> fourteen epistles are well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and undisputed.  It is not indeed right to overlook the fact that some have rejected the <a href="../bible/heb000.htm">Epistle to the Hebrews</a>,  saying that it is disputed  by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a>, on the ground that it was not written by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. But what has been said concerning this epistle by those who lived before our time I shall quote in the proper place.  In regard to the so-called Acts of Paul,  I have not found them among the undisputed writings. </p>

<p>6. But as the same apostle, in the salutations at the end of the <a href="../bible/rom000.htm">Epistle to the Romans</a>,  has made mention among others of <a href="../cathen/07268b.htm">Hermas</a>, to whom the book called The Shepherd  is ascribed, it should be observed that this too has been disputed by some, and on their account cannot be placed among the acknowledged books; while by others it is considered quite indispensable, especially to those who need instruction in the elements of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Hence, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, it has been publicly read in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and I have found that some of the most ancient writers used it.</p>

<p>7. This will serve to show the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine writings</a> that are undisputed as well as those that are not universally acknowledged.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The First Successors of the Apostles.</h2>

<p>1. That <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> preached to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and laid the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> <q>from Jerusalem round about even unto <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>,</q> is evident both from his own words, <span class="stiki" id="note250601"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;15:19</a></span> and from the account which Luke has given in the Acts. </p>

<p>2. And in how many provinces Peter preached <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and taught the doctrine of the new covenant to those of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is clear from his own words in his epistle already mentioned as undisputed,  in which he writes to the Hebrews of the dispersion in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. <span class="stiki" id="note250604"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:1</a></span> </p>

<p>3. But the number and the names of those among them that became <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> followers of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and were judged worthy to tend the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> founded by them, it is not easy to tell, except those mentioned in the writings of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</p>

<p>4. For he had innumerable fellow-laborers, or <q>fellow-soldiers,</q> as he called them,  and most of them were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by him with an imperishable memorial, for he gave enduring testimony concerning them in his own epistles.</p>

<p>5. Luke also in the Acts speaks of his friends, and mentions them by name. </p>

<p>6. Timothy, so it is recorded, was the first to receive the episcopate of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">parish</a> in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>,  Titus of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> in Crete. </p>

<p>7. But Luke,  who was of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antiochian</a> parentage and a physician by profession,  and who was especially intimate with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and well acquainted with the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  has left us, in two inspired books, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of that spiritual healing art which he learned from them. One of these books is the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,  which he testifies that he wrote as those who were from the beginning eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered unto him, all of whom, as he says, he followed accurately from the first. <span class="stiki" id="note250613"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;1:2-3</a></span> The other book is the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>  which he composed not from the accounts of others, but from what he had seen himself.</p>

<p>8. And they say that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> meant to refer to Luke's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> wherever, as if speaking of some gospel of his own, he used the words, <q>according to my <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q> </p>

<p>9. As to the rest of his followers, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> testifies that <a href="../cathen/04484b.htm">Crescens</a> was sent to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>;  but Linus, whom he mentions in the Second Epistle to Timothy <span class="stiki" id="note250617"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:21</a></span> as his companion at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was Peter's successor in the episcopate of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> there, as has already been shown. </p>

<p>10. <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Clement</a> also, who was appointed third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> testifies, his co-laborer and fellow-soldier. </p>

<p>11. Besides these, that Areopagite, named <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>, who was the first to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> after <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> address to the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> in the Areopagus (as recorded by Luke in the Acts)  is mentioned by another <a href="../cathen/05010a.htm">Dionysius</a>, an ancient writer and pastor of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">parish</a> in <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>,  as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> at Athens.</p>

<p>12. But the events connected with the <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">apostolic succession</a> we shall relate at the proper time. Meanwhile let us continue the course of our history.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The Last Siege of the Jews after Christ.</h2>

<p>1. After <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> had held the power thirteen years,  and Galba and Otho had ruled a year and six months,  <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, who had become distinguished in the campaigns against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, was proclaimed sovereign in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and received the title of Emperor from the armies there.  Setting out immediately, therefore, for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he entrusted the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to his son <a href="../cathen/14746b.htm">Titus</a>. </p>

<p>2. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, in addition to their crime against him, had been devising as many plots as they could against his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. First <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">Stephen</a> was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned to death</a> by them,  and after him James, the son of Zebedee and the brother of John, was beheaded,  and finally James, the first that had obtained the episcopal seat in Jerusalem after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, died in the manner already described.  But the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who had been incessantly plotted against with a view to their destruction, and had been driven out of the land of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, went unto all nations to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,  relying upon the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who had said to them, <q>Go and make <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of all the nations in my <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a>.</q> </p>

<p>3. But the people of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> in Jerusalem had been commanded by a revelation, vouchsafed to approved men there before the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, to leave the city and to dwell in a certain town of Perea called <a href="../cathen/11608c.htm">Pella</a>.  And when those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had come there from Jerusalem, then, as if the royal city of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the whole land of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> were entirely destitute of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> at length overtook those who had committed such outrages against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and totally destroyed that <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> of impious men.</p>

<p>4. But the number of calamities which everywhere fell upon the nation at that time; the extreme misfortunes to which the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> were especially subjected, the thousands of men, as well as <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, that perished by the sword, by famine, and by other forms of death innumerable&mdash;all these things, as well as the many great sieges which were carried on against the cities of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and the excessive sufferings endured by those that fled to Jerusalem itself, as to a city of perfect safety, and finally the general course of the whole <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, as well as its particular occurrences in detail, and how at last the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination of desolation</a>, proclaimed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note250632"><a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse27">Daniel&nbsp;9:27</a></span> stood in the very <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a>, so celebrated of old, the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> which was now awaiting its total and final destruction by fire &mdash; all these things any one that wishes may find accurately described in the history written by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>. </p>

<p>5. But it is necessary to state that this writer records that the multitude of those who were assembled from all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> at the time of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, to the number of three million <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>,  were shut up in Jerusalem <q>as in a prison,</q> to use his own words.</p>

<p>6. For it was right that in the very days in which they had inflicted suffering upon the Saviour and the Benefactor of all, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that in those days, shut up <q>as in a prison,</q> they should meet with destruction at the hands of <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">divine justice</a>.</p>

<p>7. But passing by the particular calamities which they suffered from the attempts made upon them by the sword and by other means, I think it necessary to relate only the misfortunes which the famine caused, that those who read this work may have some means of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was not long in executing <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">vengeance</a> upon them for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The Famine which oppressed them.</h2>

<p>1. Taking the fifth book of the History of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> again in our hands, let us go through the tragedy of events which then occurred. </p>

<p>2. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>,</q> he says, it was equally dangerous to remain. For under pretense that they were going to desert, men were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of the seditions increased with the famine and both the miseries were inflamed more and more day by day.</p>

<p>3. Nowhere was food to be seen; but, bursting into the houses men searched them thoroughly, and whenever they found anything to eat they tormented the owners on the ground that they had denied that they had anything; but if they found nothing, they tortured them on the ground that they had more carefully concealed it.</p>

<p>4. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their having or not having food was found in the bodies of the poor wretches. Those of them who were still in good condition they assumed were well supplied with food, while those who were already wasted away they passed by, for it seemed absurd to slay those who were on the point of perishing for <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">want</a>.</p>

<p>5. Many, indeed, secretly sold their possessions for one measure of wheat, if they belonged to the wealthier class, of barley if they were poorer. Then shutting themselves up in the innermost parts of their houses, some ate the grain uncooked on account of their terrible want, while others baked it according as necessity and fear dictated.</p>

<p>6. Nowhere were tables set, but, snatching the yet uncooked food from the fire, they tore it in pieces. Wretched was the fare, and a lamentable spectacle it was to see the more powerful secure an abundance while the weaker mourned.</p>

<p>7. Of all evils, indeed, famine is the worst, and it destroys nothing so effectively as shame. For that which under other circumstances is worthy of respect, in the midst of famine is despised. Thus <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> snatched the food from the very mouths of their husbands and children, from their fathers, and what was most pitiable of all, mothers from their babes. And while their dearest ones were wasting away in their arms, they were not ashamed to take away from them the last drops that supported life.</p>

<p>8. And even while they were eating thus they did not remain undiscovered. But everywhere the rioters appeared, to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> them even of these portions of food. For whenever they saw a house shut up, they regarded it as a sign that those inside were taking food. And immediately bursting open the doors they rushed in and seized what they were eating, almost forcing it out of their very throats.</p>

<p>9. Old men who clung to their food were beaten, and if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> concealed it in their hands, their hair was torn for so doing. There was pity neither for gray hairs nor for infants, but, taking up the babes that clung to their morsels of food, they dashed them to the ground. But to those that anticipated their entrance and swallowed what they were about to seize, they were still more cruel, just as if they had been wronged by them.</p>

<p>10. And they devised the most terrible modes of torture to discover food, stopping up the privy passages of the poor wretches with bitter herbs, and piercing their seats with sharp rods. And men suffered things horrible even to hear of, for the sake of compelling them to confess to the possession of one loaf of bread, or in order that they might be made to disclose a single drachm of barley which they had concealed. But the tormentors themselves did not suffer hunger.</p>

<p>11. Their conduct might indeed have seemed less barbarous if they had been driven to it by necessity; but they did it for the sake of exercising their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and of providing sustenance for themselves for days to come.</p>

<p>12. And when any one crept out of the city by night as far as the outposts of the Romans to collect wild herbs and grass, they went to meet him; and when he thought he had already escaped the enemy, they seized what he had brought with him, and even though oftentimes the man would entreat them, and, calling upon the most awful name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> them to give him a portion of what he had obtained at the risk of his life, they would give him nothing back. Indeed, it was fortunate if the one that was plundered was not also slain.</p>

<p>13. To this account <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, after relating other things, adds the following:  The possibility of going out of the city being brought to an end,  all hope of safety for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was cut off. And the famine increased and devoured the people by houses and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. And the rooms were filled with dead <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, the lanes of the city with the corpses of old men.</p>

<p>14. Children and youths, swollen with the famine, wandered about the marketplaces like shadows, and fell down wherever the death agony overtook them. The sick were not strong enough to bury even their own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, and those who had the strength hesitated because of the multitude of the dead and the uncertainty as to their own <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>. Many, indeed, died while they were burying others, and many betook themselves to their graves before death came upon them.</p>

<p>15. There was neither weeping nor lamentation under these misfortunes; but the famine stifled the natural affections. Those that were dying a lingering death looked with dry eyes upon those that had gone to their rest before them. Deep silence and death-laden night encircled the city.</p>

<p>16. But the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> were more terrible than these miseries; for they broke open the houses, which were now mere sepulchres, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> the dead and stripped the covering from their bodies, and went away with a laugh. They tried the points of their swords in the dead bodies, and some that were lying on the ground still alive they thrust through in order to test their weapons. But those that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that they would use their right hand and their sword upon them, they contemptuously left to be destroyed by the famine. Every one of these died with eyes fixed upon the temple; and they left the seditious alive.</p>

<p>17. These at first gave orders that the dead should be buried out of the public treasury, for they could not endure the stench. But afterward, when they were not able to do this, they threw the bodies from the walls into the trenches.</p>

<p>18. And as <a href="../cathen/14746b.htm">Titus</a> went around and saw the trenches filled with the dead, and the thick blood oozing out of the putrid bodies, he groaned aloud, and, raising his hands, called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness that this was not his doing.</p>

<p>19. After speaking of some other things, <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> proceeds as follows:  <q>I cannot hesitate to declare what my feelings compel me to. I suppose, if the Romans had longer delayed in coming against these guilty wretches, the city would have been swallowed up by a chasm, or overwhelmed with a flood, or struck with such thunderbolts as destroyed <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>. For it had brought forth a generation of men much more godless than were those that suffered such punishment. By their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> indeed was the whole people brought to destruction.</q></p>

<p>20. And in the sixth book he writes as follows:  Of those that perished by famine in the city the number was countless, and the miseries they underwent unspeakable. For if so much as the shadow of food appeared in any house, there was <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and the dearest friends engaged in hand-to-hand conflict with one another, and snatched from each other the most wretched supports of life.</p>

<p>21. Nor would they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that even the dying were without food; but the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> would search them while they were expiring, lest any one should feign death while concealing food in his bosom. With mouths gaping for want of food, they stumbled and staggered along like mad dogs, and beat the doors as if they were <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunk</a>, and in their impotence they would rush into the same houses twice or thrice in one hour.</p>

<p>22. Necessity compelled them to eat anything they could find, and they gathered and devoured things that were not fit even for the filthiest of irrational beasts. Finally they did not abstain even from their girdles and shoes, and they stripped the hides off their shields and devoured them. Some used even wisps of old hay for food, and others gathered stubble and sold the smallest weight of it for four Attic drachm&aelig;. </p>

<p>23. But why should I speak of the shamelessness which was displayed during the famine toward inanimate things? For I am going to relate a fact such as is recorded neither by Greeks nor Barbarians; horrible to relate, incredible to hear. And indeed I should gladly have omitted this calamity, that I might not seem to posterity to be a teller of fabulous tales, if I had not innumerable witnesses to it in my own age. And besides, I should render my country poor service if I suppressed the account of the sufferings which she endured.</p>

<p>24. There was a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> named Mary that dwelt beyond Jordan, whose father was Eleazer, of the village of Bathezor  (which signifies the <em>house of <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a></em>). She was distinguished for her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and her <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and had fled with the rest of the multitude to Jerusalem and was shut up there with them during the siege.</p>

<p>25. The tyrants had <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> her of the rest of the property which she had brought with her into the city from Perea. And the remnants of her possessions and whatever food was to be seen the guards rushed in daily and snatched away from her. This made the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> terribly <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and by her frequent reproaches and imprecations she aroused the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the rapacious villains against herself.</p>

<p>26. But no one either through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or pity would slay her; and she grew weary of finding food for others to eat. The search, too, was already become everywhere difficult, and the famine was piercing her bowels and marrow, and resentment was raging more violently than famine. Taking, therefore, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and necessity as her counsellors, she proceeded to do a most unnatural thing.</p>

<p>27. Seizing her child, a boy which was sucking at her breast, she said, Oh, wretched child, in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, in famine, in sedition, for what do I preserve you? Slaves among the Romans we shall be even if we are allowed to live by them. But even slavery is anticipated by the famine, and the rioters are more cruel than both. Come, be food for me, a fury for these rioters,  and a bye-word to the world, for this is all that is wanting to complete the calamities of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>28. And when she had said this she slew her son; and having roasted him, she ate one half herself, and covering up the remainder, she kept it. Very soon the rioters appeared on the scene, and, smelling the nefarious odor, they threatened to slay her immediately unless she should show them what she had prepared. She replied that she had saved an excellent portion for them, and with that she uncovered the remains of the child.</p>

<p>29. They were immediately seized with horror and amazement and stood transfixed at the sight. But she said, This is my own son, and the deed is mine. Eat for I too have eaten. Be not more merciful than a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, nor more compassionate than a mother. But if you are too <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and shrink from my sacrifice, I have already  eaten of it; let the rest also remain for me.</p>

<p>30. At these words the men went out trembling, in this one case being affrighted; yet with difficulty did they yield that food to the mother. Forthwith the whole city was filled with the awful crime, and as all pictured the terrible deed before their own eyes, they trembled as if they had done it themselves.</p>

<p>31. Those that were suffering from the famine now longed for death; and blessed were they that had died before hearing and seeing miseries like these.</p>

<p>32. Such was the reward which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> received for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and impiety, against the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Predictions of Christ.</h2>

<p>1. It is fitting to add to these accounts the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> prediction of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> in which he foretold these very events.</p>

<p>2. His words are as follows:  <q>Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>. For there shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</q></p>

<p>3. The historian, reckoning the whole number of the slain, says that eleven hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> perished by famine and sword,  and that the rest of the rioters and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, being betrayed by each other after the taking of the city, were slain.  But the tallest of the youths and those that were distinguished for beauty were preserved for the triumph. Of the rest of the multitude, those that were over seventeen years of age were sent as prisoners to labor in the works of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>,  while still more were scattered through the provinces to meet their death in the theaters by the sword and by beasts. Those under seventeen years of age were carried away to be sold as slaves, and of these alone the number reached ninety thousand. </p>

<p>4. These things took place in this manner in the second year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>,  in accordance with the prophecies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a>, who by divine power saw them beforehand as if they were already present, and wept and mourned according to the statement of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, who give the very words which he uttered, when, as if addressing Jerusalem herself, he said: </p>

<p>5. <q>If you had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, even you, in this day, the things which belong unto your peace! But now they are hid from your eyes. For the days shall come upon you, that your enemies shall cast a rampart about you, and compass you round, and keep you in on every side, and shall lay you and your children even with the ground.</q></p>

<p>6. And then, as if speaking concerning the people, he says,  <q>For there shall be great distress in the land, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon this people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, until the times of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> be fulfilled.</q> And again:  <q>When you shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the desolation thereof is near.</q></p>

<p>7. If any one compares the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> with the other accounts of the historian concerning the whole <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, how can one fail to wonder, and to admit that the foreknowledge and the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine and marvellously strange. </p>

<p>8. Concerning those calamities, then, that befell the whole <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish nation</a> after the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour's</a> passion and after the words which the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> uttered, when they begged the release of the robber and murderer, but besought that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Prince of Life</a> should be taken from their midst,  it is not necessary to add anything to the account of the historian.</p>

<p>9. But it may be proper to mention also those events which exhibited the graciousness of that all-good Providence which held back their destruction full forty years after their crime against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash;during which time many of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and James himself the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> there, the one who is called the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>,  were still alive, and dwelling in Jerusalem itself, remained the surest bulwark of the place. <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> thus still <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> itself long-suffering toward them in order to see whether by repentance for what they had done they might obtain pardon and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and in addition to such long-suffering, Providence also furnished wonderful signs of the things which were about to happen to them if they did not repent.</p>

<p>10. Since these matters have been thought worthy of mention by the historian already cited, we cannot do better than to recount them for the benefit of the readers of this work.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. The Signs which preceded the War.</h2>

<p>1. Taking, then, the work of this author, read what he records in the sixth book of his History. His words are as follows:  Thus were the miserable people won over at this time by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a> and false prophets;  but they did not heed nor give credit to the visions and signs that foretold the approaching desolation. On the contrary, as if struck by lightning, and as if possessing neither eyes nor understanding, they slighted the proclamations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. At one time a star, in form like a sword, stood over the city, and a comet, which lasted for a whole year; and again before the revolt and before the disturbances that led to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, when the people were gathered for the feast of unleavened bread, on the eighth of the month Xanthicus,  at the ninth hour of the night, so great a light shone about the altar and the temple that it seemed to be bright day; and this continued for half an hour. This seemed to the unskillful a good sign, but was interpreted by the sacred <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> as portending those events which very soon took place.</p>

<p>3. And at the same feast a cow, led by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> to be sacrificed, brought forth a lamb in the midst of the temple.</p>

<p>4. And the eastern gate of the inner temple, which was of bronze and very massive, and which at evening was closed with difficulty by twenty men, and rested upon iron-bound beams, and had bars sunk deep in the ground, was seen at the sixth hour of the night to open of itself.</p>

<p>5. And not many days after the feast, on the twenty-first of the month Artemisium,  a certain marvelous vision was seen which passes belief. The prodigy might seem fabulous were it not related by those who saw it, and were not the calamities which followed deserving of such signs. For before the setting of the sun chariots and armed troops were seen throughout the whole region in mid-air, wheeling through the clouds and encircling the cities.</p>

<p>6. And at the feast which is called Pentecost, when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> entered the temple at night, as was their custom, to perform the services, they said that at first they perceived a movement and a noise, and afterward a voice as of a great multitude, saying, 'Let us go hence.' </p>

<p>7. But what follows is still more terrible; for a certain Jesus, the son of Ananias, a common countryman, four years before the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>,  when the city was particularly prosperous and peaceful, came to the <a href="../cathen/14425a.htm">feast</a>, at which it was customary for all to make tents at the temple to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and suddenly began to cry out: 'A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a voice from the four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the temple, a voice against bridegrooms and brides, a voice against all the people.' Day and night he went through all the alleys crying thus.</p>

<p>8. But certain of the more distinguished citizens, vexed at the ominous cry, seized the man and beat him with many stripes. But without uttering a word in his own behalf, or saying anything in particular to those that were present, he continued to cry out in the same words as before.</p>

<p>9. And the rulers, thinking, as was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that the man was moved by a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">higher power</a>, brought him before the Roman governor.  And then, though he was scourged to the bone, he neither made supplication nor shed tears, but, changing his voice to the most lamentable tone possible, he answered each stroke with the words, 'Woe, woe unto Jerusalem.'</p>

<p>10. The same historian records another fact still more wonderful than this. He says  that a certain oracle was found in their sacred writings which declared that at that time a certain person should go forth from their country to rule the world. He himself understood that this was fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>.</p>

<p>11. But <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> did not rule the whole world, but only that part of it which was subject to the Romans. With better right could it be applied to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; to whom it was said by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>Ask of me, and I will give you the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> for your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for your possession.</q>  At that very time, indeed, the voice of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <q>went throughout all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Josephus and the Works which he has left.</h2>

<p>1. After all this it is fitting that we should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something in regard to the origin and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, who has contributed so much to the history in hand. He himself gives us information on this point in the following words:  <q><a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, the son of Mattathias, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Jerusalem, who himself fought against the Romans in the beginning and was compelled to be present at what happened afterward.</q></p>

<p>2. He was the most noted of all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of that day, not only among his own people, but also among the Romans, so that he was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by the erection of a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>,  and his works were deemed worthy of a place in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. </p>

<p>3. He wrote the whole of the  <em>Antiquities of the Jews</em>  in twenty books, and a history of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Romans which took place in his time, in seven books.  He himself testifies that the latter work was not only written in Greek, but that it was also translated by himself into his native tongue.  He is worthy of credit here because of his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a> in other matters.</p>

<p>4. There are extant also two other books of his which are worth reading. They treat of the antiquity of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,  and in them he replies to Apion the Grammarian, who had at that time written a treatise against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and also to others who had attempted to vilify the hereditary institutions of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>5. In the first of these books he gives the number of the canonical books of the so-called <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Apparently  drawing his information from ancient tradition, he shows what books were accepted without dispute among the Hebrews. His words are as follows.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. The Manner in which Josephus mentions the Divine Books.</h2>

<p>1. We have not, therefore, a multitude of books disagreeing and conflicting with one another; but we have only twenty-two, which contain the record of all time and are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> held to be divine.</p>

<p>2. Of these, <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">five</a> are by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and contain the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and the tradition respecting the origin of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and continue the history  down to his own death. This period embraces nearly three thousand years. </p>

<p>3. From the death of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to the death of Artaxerxes, who succeeded Xerxes as king of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that followed <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wrote the history of their own times in thirteen books.  The other four books contain <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and precepts for the regulation of the life of men.</p>

<p>4. From the time of Artaxerxes to our own day all the events have been recorded, but the accounts are not worthy of the same confidence that we repose in those which preceded them, because there has not been during this time an exact succession of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. </p>

<p>5. How much we are attached to our own writings is shown plainly by our treatment of them. For although so great a period has already passed by, no one has ventured either to add to or to take from them, but it is inbred in all <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from their very birth to regard them as the teachings of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to abide by them, and, if necessary, cheerfully to die for them.</p>

<p>These remarks of the historian I have thought might advantageously be introduced in this connection.</p>

<p>6. Another work of no little merit has been produced by the same writer, <em>On the Supremacy of Reason</em>,  which some have called <em>Maccabaicum</em>,  because it contains an account of the struggles of those Hebrews who contended manfully for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, as is related in the books called Maccabees.</p>

<p>7. And at the end of the twentieth book of his Antiquities  <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> himself intimates that he had purposed to write a work in four books concerning God and his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, according to the traditional opinions of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and also concerning the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, why it is that they permit some things while prohibiting others.  And the same writer also mentions in his own works other books written by himself. </p>

<p>8. In addition to these things it is proper to quote also the words that are found at the close of his Antiquities,  in confirmation of the testimony which we have drawn from his accounts. In that place he attacks Justus of Tiberias,  who, like himself, had attempted to write a history of contemporary events, on the ground that he had not written <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfully</a>. Having brought many other accusations against the man, he continues in these words: </p>

<p>9. I indeed was not afraid in respect to my writings as you were,  but, on the contrary, I presented my books to the emperors themselves when the events were almost under men's eyes. For I was conscious that I had preserved the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in my account, and hence was not disappointed in my expectation of obtaining their attestation.</p>

<p>10. And I presented my history also to many others, some of whom were present at the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, as, for instance, King Agrippa  and some of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>.</p>

<p>11. For the <a href="../cathen/14746b.htm">Emperor Titus</a> desired so much that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the events should be communicated to men by my history alone, that he endorsed the books with his own hand and commanded that they should be published. And King Agrippa wrote sixty-two epistles testifying to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a> of my account. Of these epistles <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> subjoins two.  But this will suffice in regard to him. Let us now proceed with our history.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Symeon rules the Church of Jerusalem after James.</h2>

<p>1. After the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of James  and the conquest of Jerusalem which immediately followed,  it is said that those of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> that were still living came together from all directions with those that were related to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> according to the flesh  (for the majority of them also were still alive) to take counsel as to who was worthy to succeed James.</p>

<p>2. They all with one consent pronounced Symeon,  the son of Clopas, of whom the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> also makes mention;  to be worthy of the episcopal throne of that parish. He was a cousin, as they say, of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a> records that Clopas was a brother of Joseph. </p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Vespasian commands the Descendants of David to be sought.</h2>

<p>He also relates that <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> after the conquest of Jerusalem gave orders that all that belonged to the lineage of David should be sought out, in order that none of the royal race might be left among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and in consequence of this a most terrible <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> again hung over the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Anencletus, the Second Bishop of Rome.</h2>

<p>After <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> had reigned ten years <a href="../cathen/14746b.htm">Titus</a>, his son, succeeded him.  In the second year of his reign, Linus, who had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a> for twelve years,  delivered his office to Anencletus.  But <a href="../cathen/14746b.htm">Titus</a> was succeeded by his brother <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> after he had reigned two years and the same number of months. </p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Abilius, the Second Bishop of Alexandria.</h2>

<p>In the fourth year of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, Annianus,  the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">parish of Alexandria</a>, died after holding office twenty-two years, and was succeeded by Abilius,  the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Clement, the Third Bishop of Rome.</h2>

<p>In the twelfth year of the same reign Clement succeeded Anencletus  after the latter had been <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of the church of Rome</a> for twelve years. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> in his Epistle to the Philippians informs us that this Clement was his fellow-worker. His words are as follows:  <q>With Clement and the rest of my fellow-laborers whose names are in the book of life.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 16. The Epistle of Clement.</h2>

<p>There is extant an epistle of this Clement  which is acknowledged to be genuine and is of considerable length and of remarkable merit.  He wrote it in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of Rome to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of Corinth, when a sedition had arisen in the latter <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>.  We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this epistle also has been publicly used in a great many <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> both in former times and in our own.  And of the fact that a sedition did take place in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of Corinth at the time referred to <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a> is a trustworthy witness. </p>

<h2>Chapter 17. The Persecution under Domitian.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, having shown great cruelty toward many, and having <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> no small number of well-born and notable men at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and having without cause exiled and confiscated the property of a great many other illustrious men, finally became a successor of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred and enmity</a> toward <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He was in fact the second that stirred up a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against us,  although his father <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> had undertaken nothing prejudicial to us. </p>

<h2>Chapter 18. The Apostle John and the Apocalypse.</h2>

<p>1. It is said that in this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> the apostle and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John, who was still alive, was condemned to dwell on the island of <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a> in consequence of his testimony to the divine word. </p>

<p>2. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, in the fifth book of his work Against Heresies, where he discusses the number of the name of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> which is given in the so-called Apocalypse of John,  speaks as follows concerning him: </p>

<p>3. <q>If it were necessary for his name to be proclaimed openly at the present time, it would have been declared by him who saw the revelation. For it was seen not long ago, but almost in our own generation, at the end of the reign of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>.</q></p>

<p>4. To such a degree, indeed, did the teaching of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> flourish at that time that even those writers who were far from our religion did not hesitate to mention in their histories the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> which took place during it. </p>

<p>5. And they, indeed, accurately indicated the time. For they recorded that in the fifteenth year of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>  Flavia Domitilla, daughter of a sister of Flavius Clement, who at that time was one of the consuls of Rome,  was exiled with many others to the island of Pontia in consequence of testimony borne to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Domitian commands the Descendants of David to be slain.</h2>

<p>But when this same <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> had commanded that the descendants of David should be slain, an ancient tradition says  that some of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> brought accusation against the descendants of Jude (said to have been a <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Saviour</a> according to the flesh), on the ground that they were of the lineage of David and were related to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself. <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a> relates these facts in the following words.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. The Relatives of our Saviour.</h2>

<p>1. Of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> there were still living the grandchildren of Jude, who is said to have been the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">Lord's brother</a> according to the flesh. </p>

<p>2. Information was given that they belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David, and they were brought to the <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Emperor Domitian</a> by the Evocatus.  For <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> feared the coming of <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> also had feared it. And he asked them if they were descendants of David, and they confessed that they were. Then he asked them how much property they had, or how much money they owned. And both of them answered that they had only nine thousand denarii,  half of which belonged to each of them.</p>

<p>4. And this property did not consist of silver, but of a piece of land which contained only thirty-nine acres, and from which they raised their taxes  and supported themselves by their own labor. </p>

<p>5. Then they showed their hands, exhibiting the hardness of their bodies and the callousness produced upon their hands by continuous toil as evidence of their own labor.</p>

<p>6. And when they were asked concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and his kingdom, of what sort it was and where and when it was to appear, they answered that it was not a temporal nor an earthly kingdom, but a heavenly and angelic one, which would appear at the end of the world, when he should come in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judge</a> the quick and the dead, and to give unto every one according to his works.</p>

<p>7. Upon hearing this, <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> did not pass judgment against them, but, despising them as of no account, he let them go, and by a decree put a stop to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>8. But when they were released they ruled the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> because they were witnesses  and were also <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.  And peace being established, they lived until the time of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>. These things are related by <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a>.</p>

<p>9. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> also has mentioned <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> in the following words:  <q><a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> also, who possessed a share of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> cruelty, attempted once to do the same thing that the latter did. But because he had, I suppose, some intelligence,  he very soon ceased, and even recalled those whom he had banished.</q></p>

<p>10. But after <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> had reigned fifteen years,  and Nerva had succeeded to the empire, the Roman Senate, according to the writers that record the history of those days,  voted that <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> should be cancelled, and that those who had been <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> banished should return to their homes and have their property restored to them.</p>

<p>11. It was at this time that the apostle John returned from his banishment in the island and took up his abode at <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, according to an ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Cerdon becomes the Third Ruler of the Church of Alexandria.</h2>

<p>1. After Nerva had reigned a little more than a year  he was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>. It was during the first year of his reign that Abilius,  who had ruled the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">church of Alexandria</a> for thirteen years, was succeeded by Cerdon. </p>

<p>2. He was the third that presided over that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> after Annianus,  who was the first. At that time Clement still ruled the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a>, being also the third that held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> there after <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Peter.</p>

<p>3. Linus was the first, and after him came Anencletus. </p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Ignatius, the Second Bishop of Antioch.</h2>

<p>At this time <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>  was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/05653a.htm">Evodius</a> having been the first.  Symeon  likewise was at that time the second ruler of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of Jerusalem, the <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">brother of our Saviour</a> having been the first.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Narrative Concerning John the Apostle.</h2>

<p>1. At that time the apostle and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John, the one whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> loved, was still living in Asia, and governing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> of that region, having returned after the death of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> from his exile on the island. </p>

<p>2. And that he was still alive at that time  may be established by the testimony of two witnesses. They should be trustworthy who have maintained the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and such indeed were <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> and Clement of Alexandria. </p>

<p>3. The former in the second book of his work Against Heresies, writes as follows:  <q>And all the elders that associated with John the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> in Asia bear witness that John delivered it to them. For he remained among them until the time of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>.</q> </p>

<p>4. And in the third book of the same work he attests the same thing in the following words:  <q>But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> also, which was founded by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and where John remained until the time of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, is a faithful witness of the apostolic tradition.</q></p>

<p>5. Clement likewise in his book entitled What Rich Man can be saved?  indicates the time,  and subjoins a narrative which is most attractive to those that enjoy hearing what is beautiful and profitable. Take and read the account which runs as follows: </p>

<p>6. Listen to a tale, which is not a mere tale, but a narrative  concerning <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the apostle</a>, which has been handed down and treasured up in memory. For when, after the tyrant's death,  he returned from the isle of <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a> to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, he went away upon their invitation to the neighboring territories of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to appoint <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in some places, in other places to set in order whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, elsewhere to choose to the ministry some one  of those that were pointed out by the Spirit.</p>

<p>7. When he had come to one of the cities not far away (the name of which is given by some ), and had consoled the brethren in other matters, he finally turned to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that had been appointed, and seeing a youth of powerful physique, of pleasing appearance, and of ardent temperament, he said, 'This one I commit to you in all earnestness in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as witness.' And when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had accepted the charge and had promised all, he repeated the same injunction with an appeal to the same witnesses, and then departed for Ephesus.</p>

<p>8. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>  taking home the youth committed to him, reared, kept, cherished, and finally <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>  him. After this he relaxed his stricter care and watchfulness, with the idea that in putting upon him the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">seal of the Lord</a>  he had given him a perfect protection.</p>

<p>9. But some youths of his own age, idle and dissolute, and accustomed to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> practices, corrupted him when he was thus prematurely freed from restraint. At first they enticed him by costly entertainments; then, when they went forth at night for <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>, they took him with them, and finally they demanded that he should unite with them in some greater crime.</p>

<p>10. He gradually became accustomed to such practices, and on account of the positiveness of his character,  leaving the right path, and taking the bit in his teeth like a hard-mouthed and powerful horse, he rushed the more violently down into the depths.</p>

<p>11. And finally despairing of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he no longer meditated what was insignificant, but having committed some great crime, since he was now lost once for all, he expected to suffer a like <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> with the rest. Taking them, therefore, and forming a band of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, he became a bold bandit-chief, the most violent, most bloody, most cruel of them all.</p>

<p>12. Time passed, and some necessity having arisen, they sent for John. But he, when he had set in order the other matters on account of which he had come, said, 'Come, O <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, restore us the deposit which both I and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> committed to you, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, over which you preside, being witness.'</p>

<p>13. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was at first confounded, thinking that he was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> charged in regard to money which he had not received, and he could neither <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the accusation respecting what he had not, nor could he disbelieve John. But when he said, 'I demand the young man and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the brother,' the old man, groaning deeply and at the same time bursting into tears, said, 'He is dead.' 'How and what kind of death?' 'He is dead to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,' he said; 'for he turned <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and abandoned, and at last a robber. And now, instead of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, he haunts the mountain with a band like himself.'</p>

<p>14. But the Apostle rent his clothes, and beating his head with great lamentation, he said, 'A fine guard I left for a brother's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>! But let a horse be brought me, and let some one show me the way.' He rode away from the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> just as he was, and coming to the place, he was taken prisoner by the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers'</a> outpost.</p>

<p>15. He, however, neither fled nor made entreaty, but cried out, 'For this did I come; lead me to your captain.'</p>

<p>16. The latter, meanwhile, was waiting, armed as he was. But when he recognized John approaching, he turned in shame to flee.</p>

<p>17. But John, forgetting his age, pursued him with all his might, crying out, 'Why, my son, do you flee from me, your own father, unarmed, aged? Pity me, my son; fear not; you have still hope of life. I will give account to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for you. If need be, I will willingly endure your death as the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> suffered death for us. For you will I give up my life. Stand, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has sent me.'</p>

<p>18. And he, when he heard, first stopped and looked down; then he threw away his arms, and then trembled and wept bitterly. And when the old man approached, he embraced him, making confession with lamentations as he was able, baptizing himself a second time with tears, and concealing only his right hand.</p>

<p>19. But John, pledging himself, and assuring him on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that he would find forgiveness with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, besought him, fell upon his knees, kissed his right hand itself as if now purified by repentance, and led him back to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>. And making intercession for him with copious <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and struggling together with him in continual <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, and subduing his mind by various utterances, he did not depart, as they say, until he had restored him to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, furnishing a great example of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance and a great <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of regeneration, a trophy of a visible resurrection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24. The Order of the Gospels.</h2>

<p>1. This extract from Clement I have inserted here for the sake of the history and for the benefit of my readers. Let us now point out the undisputed writings of this apostle.</p>

<p>2. And in the first place his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> under heaven, must be acknowledged as genuine.  That it has with good reason been put by the ancients in the fourth place, after the other three <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, may be made evident in the following way.</p>

<p>3. Those great and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine men, I mean the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, were purified in their life, and were adorned with every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but were uncultivated in speech. They were confident indeed in their trust in the divine and wonder-working power which was granted unto them by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, but they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how, nor did they attempt to proclaim the doctrines of their teacher in studied and artistic language, but employing only the demonstration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">divine Spirit</a>, which worked with them, and the wonder-working power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was displayed through them, they published the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> throughout the whole world, paying little attention to the composition of written works.</p>

<p>4. And this they did because they were assisted in their ministry by one greater than man. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, for instance, who surpassed them all in vigor of expression and in richness of thought, committed to writing no more than the briefest epistles,  although he had innumerable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> matters to communicate, for he had attained even unto the sights of the third heaven, had been <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">carried</a> to the very paradise of God, and had been deemed worthy to hear unspeakable utterances there. </p>

<p>5. And the rest of the followers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, the seventy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and countless others besides, were not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of these things. Nevertheless, of all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>  of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, only Matthew and John have left us written memorials, and they, tradition says, were led to write only under the pressure of necessity.</p>

<p>6. For Matthew, who had at first preached to the Hebrews, when he was about to go to other peoples, committed his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to writing in his native tongue,  and thus compensated those whom he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave for the loss of his presence.</p>

<p>7. And when <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark</a> and Luke had already published their <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>,  they say that John, who had employed all his time in proclaiming the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> orally, finally proceeded to write for the following reason. The three <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> already mentioned having come into the hands of all and into his own too, they say that he accepted them and bore witness to their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a>; but that there was lacking in them an account of the deeds done by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at the beginning of his ministry. </p>

<p>8. And this indeed is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For it is evident that the three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> recorded only the deeds done by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> for one year after the imprisonment of John the Baptist,  and indicated this in the beginning of their account.</p>

<p>9. For Matthew, after the forty days' fast and the <a href="../cathen/14504b.htm">temptation</a> which followed it, indicates the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">chronology</a> of his work when he says: <q>Now when he heard that <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> was delivered up he withdrew from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250765"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;4:12</a></span> </p>

<p>10. <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark</a> likewise says: <q>Now after that John was delivered up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> came into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250766"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse14">Mark&nbsp;1:14</a></span> And Luke, before commencing his account of the deeds of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, similarly marks the time, when he says that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, <q>adding to all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> which he had done, shut up <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> in prison.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250767"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;3:20</a></span> </p>

<p>11. They say, therefore, that the apostle John, being asked to do it for this reason, gave in his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> an account of the period which had been omitted by the earlier <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, and of the deeds done by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> during that period; that is, of those which were done before the imprisonment of the Baptist. And this is indicated by him, they say, in the following words: <q>This beginning of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a></q>;  and again when he refers to the Baptist, in the midst of the deeds of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, as still <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> in &AElig;non near Salim; <span class="stiki" id="note250769"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;3:23</a></span> where he states the matter clearly in the words: <q>For <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> was not yet cast into prison.</q> </p>

<p>12. John accordingly, in his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, records the deeds of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which were performed before the Baptist was cast into prison, but the other three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> mention the events which happened after that time.</p>

<p>13. One who understands this can no longer think that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> are at variance with one another, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John contains the first acts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while the others give an account of the latter part of his <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a>. And the genealogy of our Saviour according to the flesh John quite naturally omitted, because it had been already given by Matthew and Luke, and began with the doctrine of his divinity, which had, as it were, been reserved for him, as their superior, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">divine Spirit</a>. </p>

<p>14. These things may suffice, which we have said concerning the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Gospel of John</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which led to the composition of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Mark has been already stated by us. </p>

<p>15. But as for Luke, in the beginning of his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, he states himself the reasons which led him to write it. He states that since many others had more rashly undertaken to compose a narrative of the events of which he had acquired perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he himself, feeling the necessity of freeing us from their uncertain opinions, delivered in his own <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> an accurate account of those events in regard to which he had learned the full <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, being aided by his intimacy and his stay with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and by his acquaintance with the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. </p>

<p>16. So much for our own account of these things. But in a more fitting place we shall attempt to show by quotations from the ancients, what others have said concerning them.</p>

<p>17. But of the writings of John, not only his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, but also the <a href="../bible/1jo000.htm">former of his epistles</a>, has been accepted without dispute both now and in ancient times.  But the other two are disputed. </p>

<p>18. In regard to the Apocalypse, the opinions of most men are still divided.  But at the proper time this question likewise shall be decided from the testimony of the ancients. </p>

<h2>Chapter 25. The Divine Scriptures that are accepted and those that are not.</h2> 

<p>1. Since we are dealing with this subject it is proper to sum up the writings of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> which have been already mentioned. First then must be put the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> quaternion of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>;  following them the Acts of the Apostles. </p>

<p>2. After this must be reckoned the epistles of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>;  next in order the extant <a href="../bible/1jo000.htm">former epistle of John</a>,  and likewise the epistle of Peter,  must be maintained.  After them is to be placed, if it really seem proper, the Apocalypse of John,  concerning which we shall give the different opinions at the proper time.  These then belong among the accepted writings. </p>

<p>3. Among the disputed writings,  which are nevertheless recognized  by many, are extant the so-called epistle of James  and that of Jude,  also the <a href="../bible/2pe000.htm">second epistle of Peter</a>,  and those that are called the <!--k28--<a href="../bible/2jo000.htm">second</a> and <!--k28--<a href="../bible/3jo000.htm">third of John</a>,  whether they belong to the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> or to another person of the same name.</p>

<p>4. Among the rejected writings  must be reckoned also the Acts of Paul,  and the so-called Shepherd,  and the Apocalypse of Peter,  and in addition to these the extant <a href="../cathen/02299a.htm">epistle of Barnabas</a>,  and the so-called <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Teachings of the Apostles</a>;  and besides, as I said, the Apocalypse of John, if it seem proper, which some, as I said, reject,  but which others class with the accepted books. </p>

<p>5. And among these some have placed also the Gospel according to the Hebrews,  with which those of the Hebrews that have accepted <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are especially delighted. And all these may be reckoned among the disputed books. </p>

<p>6. But we have nevertheless felt compelled to give a catalogue of these also, distinguishing those works which according to <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a> are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and genuine and commonly accepted,  from those others which, although not canonical but disputed,  are yet at the same time <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to most <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers&mdash; we have felt compelled to give this catalogue in order that we might be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both these works and those that are cited by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> under the name of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, including, for instance, such books as the Gospels of Peter,  of Thomas,  of Matthias,  or of any others besides them, and the Acts of Andrew  and John  and the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, which no one belonging to the succession of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers has deemed worthy of mention in his writings.</p>

<p>7. And further, the character of the style is at variance with apostolic usage, and both the thoughts and the purpose of the things that are related in them are so completely out of accord with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> that they clearly show themselves to be the fictions of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.  Wherefore they are not to be placed even among the rejected writings,  but are all of them to be cast aside as absurd and impious.</p>

<p>Let us now proceed with our history.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Menander the Sorcerer.</h2>

<p>1. Menander,  who succeeded <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>,  showed himself in his conduct another instrument of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">diabolical</a> power,  not inferior to the former. He also was a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> and carried his sorceries to no less an extent than his teacher had done, and at the same time reveled in still more marvelous tales than he.</p>

<p>2. For he said that he was himself the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, who had been sent down from invisible <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men;  and he taught that no one could gain the mastery over the world-creating <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves  unless he had first gone through the magical discipline imparted by him and had received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from him. Those who were deemed worthy of this would partake even in the present life of perpetual <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and would never die, but would remain here forever, and without growing old become <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.  These facts can be easily learned from the works of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>. </p>

<p>3. And Justin, in the passage in which he mentions <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a>, gives an account of this man also, in the following words:  <q>And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that a certain Menander, who was also a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, from the village of Capparattea,  was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a>, and that he also, being driven by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>  and deceived many by his magical art. And he persuaded his followers that they should not die. And there are still some of them that assert this.</q></p>

<p>4. And it was indeed an artifice of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to endeavor, by means of such sorcerers, who assumed the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, to defame the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness by magic art, and through them to make ridiculous the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the resurrection of the dead.  But they that have chosen these men as their saviours have fallen away from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> hope.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. The Heresy of the Ebionites.</h2> 

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, however, being unable to tear certain others from their allegiance to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet found them susceptible in a different direction, and so brought them over to his own purposes. The ancients quite properly called these men <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, because they held poor and mean opinions concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. </p>

<p>2. For they considered him a plain and common man, who was justified only because of his superior <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and who was the fruit of the intercourse of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with Mary. In their opinion the observance of the ceremonial law was altogether necessary, on the ground that they could not be saved by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone and by a corresponding life. </p>

<p>3. There were others, however, besides them, that were of the same name,  but avoided the strange and absurd beliefs of the former, and did not deny that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But nevertheless, inasmuch as they also refused to acknowledge that he pre-existed,  being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Word, and Wisdom, they turned aside into the impiety of the former, especially when they, like them, endeavored to observe strictly the bodily worship of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>. </p>

<p>4. These men, moreover, thought that it was necessary to reject all the epistles of the apostle, whom they called an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>;  and they used only the so-called Gospel according to the Hebrews  and made small account of the rest.</p>

<p>5. The <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and the rest of the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> they observed just like them, but at the same time, like us, they celebrated the Lord's days as a memorial of the resurrection of the Saviour. </p>

<p>6. Wherefore, in consequence of such a course they received the name of <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, which signified the poverty of their understanding. For this is the name by which a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man is called among the Hebrews. </p>

<h2>Chapter 28. Cerinthus the Heresiarch.</h2>

<p>1. We have understood that at this time <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>,  the author of another <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, made his appearance. Caius, whose words we quoted above,  in the Disputation which is ascribed to him, writes as follows concerning this man:</p>

<p>2. <q>But <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> also, by means of <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a> which he pretends were written by a great apostle, brings before us marvelous things which he <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> claims were shown him by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and he says that after the resurrection the kingdom of Christ will be set up on earth, and that the flesh dwelling in Jerusalem will again be subject to desires and pleasures. And being an enemy of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he asserts, with the purpose of deceiving men, that there is to be a period of a thousand years  for marriage festivals.</q> </p>

<p>3. And <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius</a>,  who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">parish of Alexandria</a> in our day, in the second book of his work <em>On the Promises</em>, where he says some things concerning the Apocalypse of John which he draws from tradition, mentions this same man in the following words: </p>

<p>4. But (they say that) <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, who founded the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> which was called, after him, the Cerinthian, desiring reputable authority for his fiction, prefixed the name. For the doctrine which he taught was this: that the kingdom of Christ will be an earthly one.</p>

<p>5. And as he was himself devoted to the pleasures of the body and altogether sensual in his nature, he dreamed that that kingdom would consist in those things which he desired, namely, in the delights of the belly and of sexual passion, that is to say, in eating and drinking and marrying, and in festivals and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and the slaying of victims, under the guise of which he thought he could indulge his appetites with a better grace.</p>

<p>6. These are the words of <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, in the first book of his work Against Heresies,  gives some more abominable <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> of the same man, and in the third book relates a story which deserves to be recorded. He says, on the authority of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, that the apostle John once entered a bath to bathe; but, learning that <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> was within, he sprang from the place and rushed out of the door, for he could not bear to remain under the same roof with him. And he advised those that were with him to do the same, saying, <q>Let us flee, lest the bath fall; for <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is within.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 29. Nicolaus and the Sect named after him.</h2>

<p>1. At this time the so-called <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a> made its appearance and lasted for a very short time. Mention is made of it in the Apocalypse of John.  They boasted that the author of their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was Nicolaus, one of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> who, with <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">Stephen</a>, were appointed by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> for the purpose of ministering to the poor.  Clement of Alexandria, in the third book of his Stromata, relates the following things concerning him. </p>

<p>2. They say that he had a beautiful wife, and after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension of the Saviour</a>, being accused by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of jealousy, he led her into their midst and gave permission to any one that wished to marry her. For they say that this was in accord with that saying of his, that one ought to abuse the flesh. And those that have followed his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, imitating blindly and foolishly that which was done and said, commit fornication without shame.</p>

<p>3. But I understand that Nicolaus had to do with no other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> than her to whom he was married, and that, so far as his children are concerned, his daughters continued in a state of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> until old age, and his son remained uncorrupt. If this is so, when he brought his wife, whom he jealously loved, into the midst of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, he was evidently renouncing his passion; and when he used the expression, 'to abuse the flesh,' he was inculcating self-control in the face of those pleasures that are eagerly pursued. For I suppose that, in accordance with the command of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, he did not wish to serve two masters, pleasure and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>. </p>

<p>4. But they say that <a href="../cathen/10066a.htm">Matthias</a> also taught in the same manner that we ought to fight against and abuse the flesh, and not give way to it for the sake of pleasure, but strengthen the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.  So much concerning those who then attempted to pervert the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but in less time than it has taken to tell it became entirely extinct.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30. The Apostles that were Married.</h2>

<p>1. Clement, indeed, whose words we have just quoted, after the above-mentioned facts gives a statement, on account of those who rejected marriage, of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> that had wives.  <q>Or will they,</q> says he,  <q>reject even the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? For Peter  and Philip  begot children; and Philip also gave his daughters in marriage. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> does not hesitate, in one of his epistles, to greet his wife,  whom he did not take about with him, that he might not be inconvenienced in his ministry.</q></p>

<p>2. And since we have mentioned this subject it is not improper to subjoin another account which is given by the same author and which is worth reading. In the seventh book of his Stromata he writes as follows:  <q>They say, accordingly, that when the blessed Peter saw his own wife led out to die, he rejoiced because of her summons and her return home, and called to her very encouragingly and comfortingly, addressing her by name, and saying, 'Remember the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.' Such was the marriage of the blessed, and their perfect disposition toward those dearest to them.</q> This account being in keeping with the subject in hand, I have related here in its proper place.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31. The Death of John and Philip.</h2>

<p>1. The time and the manner of the death of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Peter as well as their burial places, have been already shown by us. </p>

<p>2. The time of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John's</a> death has also been given in a general way,  but his burial place is indicated by an epistle of Polycrates  (who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">parish of Ephesus</a>), addressed to <a href="../cathen/15408a.htm">Victor</a>,  <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>. In this epistle he mentions him together with the apostle Philip and his daughters in the following words: </p>

<p>3. <q>For in Asia also great lights have fallen asleep, which shall rise again on the last day, at the coming of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, when he shall come with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from heaven and shall seek out all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Among these are Philip, one of the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  who sleeps in Hierapolis,  and his two aged virgin daughters, and another daughter who lived in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and now rests at Ephesus;  and moreover John, who was both a witness  and a teacher, who reclined upon the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> wore the sacerdotal plate.  He also sleeps at Ephesus.</q> </p>

<p>4. So much concerning their death. And in the Dialogue of Caius which we mentioned a little above,  Proclus,  against whom he directed his disputation, in agreement with what has been quoted,  speaks thus concerning the death of Philip and his daughters: <q>After him  there were four prophetesses, the daughters of Philip, at Hierapolis in Asia. Their tomb is there and the tomb of their father.</q> Such is his statement.</p>

<p>5. But Luke, in the Acts of the Apostles, mentions the daughters of Philip who were at that time at C&aelig;sarea in Judea with their father, and were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. His words are as follows: <q>We came unto C&aelig;sarea; and entering into the house of Philip the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, who was one of the <a href="../cathen/13741c.htm">seven</a>, we abode with him. Now this man had four daughters, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, which did prophesy.</q> </p>

<p>6. We have thus set forth in these pages what has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostolic</a> age, and concerning the sacred writings which they have left us, as well as concerning those which are disputed, but nevertheless have been publicly used by many in a great number of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>,  and moreover, concerning those that are altogether rejected and are out of harmony with apostolic <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. Having done this, let us now proceed with our history.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32. Symeon, Bishop of Jerusalem, suffers Martyrdom.</h2>

<p>1. It is reported that after the age of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> and <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, under the emperor whose times we are now recording,  a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was stirred up against us in certain cities in consequence of a popular uprising.  In this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> we have understood that Symeon, the son of Clopas, who, as we have shown, was the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of Jerusalem,  suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<p>2. <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a>, whose words we have already quoted in various places,  is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to this fact also. Speaking of certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>  he adds that Symeon was accused by them at this time; and since it was clear that he was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, he was tortured in various ways for many days, and astonished even the judge himself and his attendants in the highest degree, and finally he suffered a death similar to that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>. </p>

<p>3. But there is nothing like hearing the historian himself, who writes as follows: <q>Certain of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> brought accusation against Symeon, the son of Clopas, on the ground that he was a descendant of David  and a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; and thus he suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, at the age of one hundred and twenty years,  while <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> was emperor and Atticus governor.</q> </p>

<p>4. And the same writer says that his accusers also, when search was made for the descendants of David, were arrested as belonging to that <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.  And it might be reasonably assumed that Symeon was one of those that saw and heard the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>,  judging from the length of his life, and from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> makes mention of <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">Mary, the wife of Clopas</a>,  who was the father of Symeon, as has been already shown. </p>

<p>5. The same historian says that there were also others, descended from one of the so-called brothers of the Saviour, whose name was <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Judas</a>, who, after they had borne testimony before <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, as has been already recorded,  in behalf of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, lived until the same reign.</p>

<p>6. He writes as follows: <q>They came, therefore, and took the lead of every <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">church</a>  as witnesses  and as <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>. And profound peace being established in every <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">church</a>, they remained until the reign of the <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Emperor Trajan</a>,  and until the above-mentioned Symeon, son of Clopas, an uncle of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, was informed against by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and was himself in like manner accused for the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>  before the governor Atticus.  And after being tortured for many days he suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and all, including even the proconsul, marveled that, at the age of one hundred and twenty years, he could endure so much. And orders were given that he should be crucified.</q></p>

<p>7. In addition to these things the same man, while recounting the events of that period, records that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> up to that time had remained a pure and uncorrupted virgin, since, if there were any that attempted to corrupt the sound norm of the preaching of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, they lay until then concealed in obscure darkness.</p>

<p>8. But when the sacred college of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had suffered death in various forms, and the generation of those that had been deemed worthy to hear the inspired wisdom with their own ears had passed away, then the league of godless <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> took its rise as a result of the folly of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teachers,  who, because none of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> was still living, attempted henceforth, with a bold face, to proclaim, in opposition to the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the '<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so-called.' </p>

<h2>Chapter 33. Trajan forbids the Christians to be sought after.</h2>

<p>1. So great a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was at that time opened against us in many places that Plinius Secundus, one of the most noted of governors, being disturbed by the great number of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, communicated with the <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">emperor</a> concerning the multitude of those that were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.  At the same time, he informed him in his communication that he had not heard of their doing anything profane or contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>&mdash;except that they arose at dawn  and sang <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but that they renounced <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and like criminal offenses, and did all things in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.</p>

<p>2. In reply to this <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> made the following decree: that the race of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should not be sought after, but when found should be punished. On account of this the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which had threatened to be a most terrible one was to a certain degree checked, but there were still left plenty of pretexts for those who wished to do us harm. Sometimes the people, sometimes the rulers in various places, would lay plots against us, so that, although no great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> took place, local <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> were nevertheless going on in particular provinces,  and many of the faithful endured <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in various forms.</p>

<p>3. We have taken our account from the Latin Apology of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> which we mentioned above.  The translation runs as follows:  And indeed we have found that search for us has been forbidden.  For when Plinius Secundus, the governor of a province, had condemned certain <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and deprived them of their dignity,  he was confounded by the multitude, and was uncertain what further course to pursue. He therefore communicated with <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan the emperor</a>, informing him that, aside from their unwillingness to sacrifice,  he had found no impiety in them.</p>

<p>4. And he reported this also, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> arose  early in the morning and sang <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> unto <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for the purpose of preserving their discipline  forbade <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>, and the like. In reply to this <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> wrote that the race of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should not be sought after, but when found should be punished. Such were the events which took place at that time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34. Evarestus, the Fourth Bishop of the Church of Rome.</h2>

<p>1. In the third year of the reign of the <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">emperor</a> mentioned above,  Clement  committed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">episcopal government</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a> to <a href="../cathen/05646a.htm">Evarestus</a>,  and departed this life after he had superintended the teaching of the divine word nine years in all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35. Justus, the Third Bishop of Jerusalem.</h2>

<p>1. But when Symeon also had died in the manner described,  a certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> by the name of Justus  succeeded to the episcopal throne in Jerusalem. He was one of the many thousands <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">of the circumcision</a> who at that time <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chatper36">Chapter 36. Ignatius and His Epistles.</h2>

<p>1. At that time <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>,  a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, was a man of eminence in Asia, having been entrusted with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> by those who had seen and heard the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</p>

<p>2. And at the same time <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the parish of Hierapolis,  became well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as did also <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who was chosen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, second in succession to Peter, and whose fame is still celebrated by a great many. </p>

<p>3. Report says that he was sent from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and became food for wild beasts on account of his testimony to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. </p>

<p>4. And as he made the journey through Asia under the strictest military surveillance, he fortified the parishes in the various cities where he stopped by oral homilies and exhortations, and warned them above all to be especially on their guard against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> that were then beginning to prevail, and exhorted them to hold fast to the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Moreover, he thought it necessary to attest that tradition in writing, and to give it a fixed form for the sake of greater security.</p>

<p>5. So when he came to <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, where <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> was, he wrote an epistle to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of Ephesus,  in which he mentions Onesimus, its pastor;  and another to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of <a href="../cathen/09533a.htm">Magnesia</a>, situated upon the M&aelig;ander, in which he makes mention again of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Damas; and finally one to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of <a href="../cathen/15016c.htm">Tralles</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he states, was at that time Polybius.</p>

<p>6. In addition to these he wrote also to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a>, entreating them not to secure his release from <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and thus rob him of his earnest hope. In confirmation of what has been said it is proper to quote briefly from this epistle.</p>

<p>7. He writes as follows:  From <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> even unto Rome I fight with wild beasts, by land and by sea, by night and by day, being bound amidst ten leopards  that is, a company of soldiers who only become worse when they are well treated. In the midst of their wrongdoings, however, I am more fully learning discipleship, but I am not thereby justified. </p>

<p>8. May I have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the beasts that are prepared for me; and I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that I may find them ready; I will even coax them to devour me quickly that they may not treat me as they have some whom they have refused to touch through fear.  And if they are unwilling, I will compel them. Forgive me.</p>

<p>9. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is expedient for me. Now do I begin to be a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. May nothing of things visible and things invisible <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> me;  that I may attain unto <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Let fire and cross and attacks of wild beasts, let wrenching of bones, cutting of limbs, crushing of the whole body, tortures of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>&mdash;let all these come upon me if only I may attain unto <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>10. These things he wrote from the above-mentioned city to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> referred to. And when he had left Smyrna he wrote again from <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>  to the Philadelphians and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of Smyrna; and particularly to <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, who presided over the latter <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>. And since he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him well as an apostolic man, he commended to him, like a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and good shepherd, the flock at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and besought him to care diligently for it. </p>

<p>11. And the same man, writing to the Smyrn&aelig;ans, used the following words concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, taken I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whence:  <q>But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he was in the flesh after the resurrection. And when he came to Peter and his companions he said to them, Take, handle me, and see that I am not an incorporeal spirit.  And immediately they touched him and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</q> </p>

<p>12. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and mentions his epistles in the following words:  <q>As one of our people said, when he was condemned to the beasts on account of his testimony unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I am God's wheat, and by the teeth of wild beasts am I ground, that I may be found pure bread.</q></p>

<p>13. <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> also mentions these letters in the epistle to the Philippians which is ascribed to him.  His words are as follows:  <q>I exhort all of you, therefore, to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> and to practice all patience such as you saw with your own eyes not only in the blessed <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> and Rufus and Zosimus,  but also in others from among yourselves as well as in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; being persuaded that all these ran not in vain, but in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and righteousness, and that they are gone to their rightful place beside the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, with whom also they suffered. For they loved not the present world, but him that died for our sakes and was raised by God for us.</q></p>

<p>14. And afterwards he adds:  You have written to me, both you and <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, that if any one go to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> he may carry with him the letters from you. And this I will do if I have a suitable opportunity, either I myself or one whom I send to be an ambassador for you also.</p>

<p>15. The epistles of <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> which were sent to us by him and the others which we had with us we sent to you as you gave charge. They are appended to this epistle, and from them you will be able to derive great advantage. For they comprise <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and patience, and every kind of edification that pertains to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>. So much concerning <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>. But he was succeeded by Heros  in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">church of Antioch</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37. The Evangelists that were still Eminent at that Time.</h2>

<p>1. Among those that were celebrated at that time was <a href="../cathen/12589b.htm">Quadratus</a>,  who, report says, was renowned along with the daughters of Philip for his prophetical gifts. And there were many others besides these who were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in those days, and who occupied the first place among the successors of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. And they also, being illustrious <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of such great men, built up the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> which had been laid by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in every place, and preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> more and more widely and scattered the saving seeds of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> far and near throughout the whole world. </p>

<p>2. For indeed most of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of that time, animated by the divine word with a more ardent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>,  had already fulfilled the command of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and had distributed their goods to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy</a>.  Then starting out upon long journeys they performed the office of <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, being filled with the desire to preach <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to those who had not yet heard the word of faith, and to deliver to them the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">divine Gospels</a>.</p>

<p>3. And when they had only laid the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in foreign places, they appointed others as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, and entrusted them with the nurture of those that had recently been brought in, while they themselves went on again to other countries and nations, with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and the co-operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For a great many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> were done through them by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">divine Spirit</a>, so that at the first hearing whole multitudes of men eagerly embraced the religion of the Creator of the universe.</p>

<p>4. But since it is impossible for us to enumerate the names of all that became shepherds or <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> throughout the world in the age immediately succeeding the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, we have recorded, as was fitting, the names of those only who have transmitted the apostolic doctrine to us in writings still extant.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38. The Epistle of Clement and the Writings falsely ascribed to him.</h2>

<p>1. Thus <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> has done in the epistles which we have mentioned,  and Clement in his epistle which is accepted by all, and which he wrote in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of Rome to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of Corinth.  In this epistle he gives many thoughts drawn from the Epistle to the Hebrews, and also quotes verbally some of its expressions, thus showing most plainly that it is not a recent production.</p>

<p>2. Wherefore it has seemed reasonable to reckon it with the other writings of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had written to the Hebrews in his native tongue, some say that the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> Luke, others that this Clement himself, translated the epistle.</p>

<p>3. The latter seems more probable, because the epistle of Clement and that to the Hebrews have a similar character in regard to style, and still further because the thoughts contained in the two works are not very different. </p>

<p>4. But it must be observed also that there is said to be a second epistle of Clement. But we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is recognized like the former, for we do not find that the ancients have made any use of it. </p>

<p>5. And certain men have lately brought forward other wordy and lengthy writings under his name, containing dialogues of Peter and Apion.  But no mention has been made of these by the ancients; for they do not even preserve the pure stamp of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostolic</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. The acknowledged writing of Clement is well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. We have spoken also of the works of <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> and <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 39. The Writings of Papias.</h2>

<p>1. There are extant five books of <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a>, which bear the title Expositions of Oracles of the Lord.  <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> makes mention of these as the only works written by him,  in the following words:  <q>These things are attested by <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a>, an ancient man who was a hearer of John and a companion of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, in his fourth book. For five books have been written by him.</q> These are the words of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>.</p>

<p>2. But <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a> himself in the preface to his discourses by no means declares that he was himself a hearer and eye-<a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but he shows by the words which he uses that he received the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from those who were their friends. </p>

<p>3. He says: But I shall not hesitate also to put down for you along with my interpretations  whatsoever things I have at any time learned carefully from the elders  and carefully remembered, guaranteeing their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For I did not, like the multitude, take pleasure in those that speak much, but in those that teach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; not in those that relate strange commandments, but in those that deliver  the commandments given by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  and springing from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself.</p>

<p>4. If, then, any one came, who had been a follower of the elders, I questioned him in regard to the words of the elders&mdash; what <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> or what Peter said, or what was said by Philip, or by <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a>, or by James, or by John, or by Matthew, or by any other of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and what things Aristion  and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> John,  the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, say. For I did not think that what was to be gotten from the books  would profit me as much as what came from the living and abiding voice.</p>

<p>5. It is worth while observing here that the name John is twice enumerated by him.  The first one he mentions in connection with Peter and James and Matthew and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, clearly meaning the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>; but the other John he mentions after an interval, and places him among others outside of the number of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, putting Aristion before him, and he distinctly calls him a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>.</p>

<p>6. This shows that the statement of those is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, who say that there were two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in Asia that bore the same name, and that there were two tombs in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, each of which, even to the present day, is called John's.  It is important to notice this. For it is probable that it was the second, if one is not willing to admit that it was the first that saw the Revelation, which is ascribed by name to John. </p>

<p>7. And <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a>, of whom we are now speaking, confesses that he received the words of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> from those that followed them, but says that he was himself a hearer of Aristion and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> John. At least he mentions them frequently by name, and gives their traditions in his writings. These things, we hope, have not been uselessly adduced by us.</p>

<p>8. But it is fitting to subjoin to the words of <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a> which have been quoted, other passages from his works in which he relates some other wonderful events which he claims to have received from tradition.</p>

<p>9. That Philip the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> dwelt at Hierapolis with his daughters has been already stated.  But it must be noted here that <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a>, their contemporary, says that he heard a wonderful tale from the daughters of Philip. For he relates that in his time  one rose from the dead. And he tells another wonderful story of Justus, surnamed Barsabbas: that he drank a deadly poison, and yet, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, suffered no harm.</p>

<p>10. The Book of Acts records that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> after the ascension of the Saviour, put forward this Justus, together with <a href="../cathen/10066a.htm">Matthias</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that one might be chosen in place of the traitor Judas, to fill up their number. The account is as follows: <q>And they put forward two, Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and <a href="../cathen/10066a.htm">Matthias</a>; and they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and said.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note250955"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse23">Acts&nbsp;1:23</a></span> </p>

<p>11. The same writer gives also other accounts which he says came to him through unwritten tradition, certain strange <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and teachings of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and some other more mythical things. </p>

<p>12. To these belong his statement that there will be a period of some thousand years after the resurrection of the dead, and that the kingdom of Christ will be set up in material form on this very earth.  I suppose he got these ideas through a misunderstanding of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostolic</a> accounts, not perceiving that the things said by them were spoken <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> in figures.</p>

<p>13. For he appears to have been of very limited understanding,  as one can see from his discourses. But it was due to him that so many of the Church Fathers after him adopted a like opinion, urging in their own support the antiquity of the man; as for instance <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> and any one else that may have proclaimed similar views. </p>

<p>14. <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a> gives also in his own work other accounts of the words of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> on the authority of Aristion who was mentioned above, and traditions as handed down by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> John; to which we refer those who are fond of learning. But now we must add to the words of his which we have already quoted the tradition which he gives in regard to Mark, the author of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>15. <q>This also the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>  said: Mark, having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately, though not in order, whatsoever he remembered of the things said or done by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  For he neither heard the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> nor followed him, but afterward, as I said, he followed Peter, who adapted his teaching to the needs of his hearers, but with no intention of giving a connected account of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> discourses,  so that Mark committed no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> while he thus wrote some things as he remembered them. For he was careful of one thing, not to omit any of the things which he had heard, and not to state any of them <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>.</q> These things are related by <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a> concerning Mark.</p>

<p>16. But concerning Matthew he writes as follows: <q>So then  Matthew wrote the oracles in the Hebrew language, and every one interpreted them as he was able.</q>  And the same writer uses testimonies from the first Epistle of John  and from that of Peter likewise.  And he relates another story of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who was accused of many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> before the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, which is contained in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to the Hebrews.  These things we have thought it necessary to observe in addition to what has been already stated.</p>
