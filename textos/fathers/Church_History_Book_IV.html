<h1>Church History (Book IV)</h1>

<h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1. The Bishops of Rome and of Alexandria during the Reign of Trajan.</h2> 

<p>1. About the twelfth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the parish of Alexandria  died, and Primus,  the fourth in succession from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, was chosen to the office.</p>

<p>2. At that time also Alexander,  the fifth in the line of succession from Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, received the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, after Evarestus had held the office eight years. </p>

<h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2. The Calamities of the Jews during Trajan's Reign.</h2>

<p>1. The teaching and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> flourished greatly and made progress from day to day; but the calamities of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> increased, and they underwent a constant succession of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. In the eighteenth year of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan's</a> reign  there was another disturbance of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, through which a great multitude of them perished. </p>

<p>2. For in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> and in the rest of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and also in Cyrene,  as if incited by some terrible and factious spirit, they rushed into seditious measures against their fellow-inhabitants, the Greeks. The insurrection increased greatly, and in the following year, while Lupus was governor of all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>,  it developed into a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of no mean magnitude.</p>

<p>3. In the first attack it happened that they were victorious over the Greeks, who fled to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> and imprisoned and slew the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were in the city. But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Cyrene, although deprived of their aid, continued to plunder the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and to devastate its districts,  under the leadership of Lucuas.  Against them the emperor sent Marcius Turbo  with a foot and naval force and also with a force of cavalry.</p>

<p>4. He carried on the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against them for a long time and fought many battles, and slew many thousands of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, not only of those of Cyrene, but also of those who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and had come to the assistance of their king Lucuas.</p>

<p>5. But the emperor, fearing that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in Mesopotamia would also make an attack upon the inhabitants of that country, commanded Lucius Quintus  to clear the province of them. And he having marched against them slew a great multitude of those that dwelt there; and in consequence of his success he was made governor of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> by the emperor. These events are recorded also in these very words by the Greek historians that have written accounts of those times. </p>

<h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3. The Apologists that wrote in Defense of the Faith during the Reign of Adrian.</h2>

<p>1. After <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> had reigned for nineteen and a half years  <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">&AElig;lius Adrian</a> became his successor in the empire. To him <a href="../cathen/12589b.htm">Quadratus</a> addressed a discourse containing an apology for our religion,  because certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men  had attempted to trouble the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The work is still in the hands of a great many of the brethren, as also in our own, and furnishes clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the man's understanding and of his apostolic <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. </p>

<p>2. He himself reveals the early date at which he lived in the following words: <q>But the works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> were always present,  for they were genuine:&mdash; those that were healed, and those that were raised from the dead, who were seen not only when they were healed and when they were raised, but were also always present; and not merely while the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> was on earth, but also after his death, they were alive for quite a while, so that some of them lived even to our day.</q>  Such then was <a href="../cathen/12589b.htm">Quadratus</a>.</p>

<p>3. <a href="../cathen/01712d.htm">Aristides</a> also, a believer earnestly devoted to our religion, left, like <a href="../cathen/12589b.htm">Quadratus</a>, an apology for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, addressed to <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Adrian</a>.  His work, too, has been preserved even to the present day by a great many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4. The Bishops of Rome and of Alexandria under the Same Emperor.</h2> 

<p>In the third year of the same reign, Alexander,  <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, died after holding office ten years. His successor was Xystus.  About the same time Primus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, died in the twelfth year of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>,  and was succeeded by Justus. </p>

<h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5. The Bishops of Jerusalem from the Age of our Saviour to the Period under Consideration</h2>

<p>1. The chronology of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Jerusalem I have nowhere found preserved in writing;  for tradition says that they were all short lived.</p>

<p>2. But I have learned this much from writings,  that until the siege of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, which took place under <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Adrian</a>,  there were fifteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in succession there,  all of whom are said to have been of Hebrew descent, and to have received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in purity, so that they were approved by those who were able to judge of such matters, and were deemed worthy of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. For their whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> consisted then of believing Hebrews who continued from the days of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> until the siege which took place at this time; in which siege the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, having again rebelled against the Romans, were conquered after severe battles.</p>

<p>3. But since the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> ceased at this time, it is proper to give here a list of their names from the beginning. The first, then, was James, the so-called <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>;  the second, Symeon;  the third, Justus;  the fourth, Zacch&aelig;us;  the fifth, Tobias; the sixth, Benjamin; the seventh, John; the eighth, Matthias; the ninth, Philip; the tenth, Seneca;  the eleventh, Justus; the twelfth, Levi; the thirteenth, Ephres;  the fourteenth, Joseph;  and finally, the fifteenth, Judas.</p>

<p>4. These are the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Jerusalem that lived between the age of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and the time referred to, all of them belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.</p>

<p>5. In the twelfth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Adrian</a>, Xystus, having completed the tenth year of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>,  was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/14477b.htm">Telesphorus</a>,  the seventh in succession from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. In the meantime, after the lapse of a year and some months, Eumenes,  the sixth in order, succeeded to the leadership of the Alexandrian church, his predecessor having held office eleven years. </p>

<h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6. The Last Siege of the Jews under Adrian.</h2>

<p>1. As the rebellion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at this time grew much more serious,  Rufus, governor of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, after an auxiliary force had been sent him by the emperor, using their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> as a pretext, proceeded against them without mercy, and destroyed indiscriminately thousands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, and in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> reduced their country to a state of complete subjection.</p>

<p>2. The leader of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at this time was a man by the name of Barcocheba  (which signifies a star), who possessed the character of a robber and a murderer, but nevertheless, relying upon his name, boasted to them, as if they were slaves, that he possessed wonderful powers; and he pretended that he was a star that had come down to them out of heaven to bring them light in the midst of their misfortunes.</p>

<p>3. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> raged most fiercely in the eighteenth year of <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Adrian</a>,  at the city of Bithara,  which was a very secure fortress, situated not far from Jerusalem. When the siege had lasted a long time, and the rebels had been driven to the last extremity by hunger and thirst, and the instigator of the rebellion had suffered his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment, the whole nation was prohibited from this time on by a decree, and by the commands of <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Adrian</a>, from ever going up to the country about Jerusalem. For the emperor gave orders that they should not even see from a distance the land of their fathers. Such is the account of Aristo of Pella. </p>

<p>4. And thus, when the city had been emptied of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish nation</a> and had suffered the total destruction of its ancient inhabitants, it was colonized by a different race, and the Roman city which subsequently arose changed its name and was called <em>&AElig;lia</em>, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the emperor <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">&AElig;lius Adrian</a>. And as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> there was now composed of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the first one to assume the government of it after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was Marcus. </p>

<h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7. The Persons that became at that Time Leaders of Knowledge falsely so-called.</h2> 

<p>1. As the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> throughout the world were now shining like the most brilliant stars, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ</a> was flourishing among the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>,  the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> everything that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and is always hostile to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and most bitterly opposed to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, turned all his arts against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  In the beginning he armed himself against it with external <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>.</p>

<p>2. But now, being shut off from the use of such means,  he devised all sorts of plans, and employed other methods in his conflict with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, using base and deceitful men as instruments for the ruin of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and as ministers of destruction. Instigated by him, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a> and deceivers, assuming the name of our religion, brought to the depth of ruin such of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> as they could win over, and at the same time, by means of the deeds which they practiced, turned away from the path which leads to the word of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> those who were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>3. Accordingly there proceeded from that Menander, whom we have already mentioned as the successor of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a>,  a certain serpent-like power, double-tongued and two-headed, which produced the leaders of two different <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, Saturninus, an <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antiochian</a> by birth,  and <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a>.  The former of these established schools of godless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, the latter in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>.</p>

<p>4. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> states  that the false teaching of Saturninus agreed in most respects with that of Menander, but that <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, under the pretext of unspeakable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, invented monstrous fables, and carried the fictions of his impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> quite beyond bounds.</p>

<p>5. But as there were at that time a great many members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>  who were fighting for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and defending apostolic and ecclesiastical doctrine with uncommon eloquence, so there were some also that furnished posterity through their writings with means of defense against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> to which we have referred. </p>

<p>6. Of these there has come down to us a most powerful refutation of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> by Agrippa Castor,  one of the most renowned writers of that day, which shows the terrible imposture of the man.</p>

<p>7. While exposing his <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> he says that <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> wrote twenty-four books upon the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,  and that he invented <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> for himself named Barcabbas and Barcoph,  and others that had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and that he gave them barbarous names in order to amaze those who marvel at such things; that he taught also that the eating of meat offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and the unguarded <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">renunciation of the faith</a> in times of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> were matters of indifference;  and that he enjoined upon his followers, like <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoras</a>, a silence of five years. </p>

<p>8. Other similar things the above-mentioned writer has recorded concerning <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, and has ably exposed the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p>9. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> also writes  that Carpocrates was a contemporary of these men, and that he was the father of another <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, called the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>,  who did not wish to transmit any longer the magic arts of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a>, as that one  had done, in secret, but openly.  For they boasted &mdash; as of something great &mdash; of love potions that were carefully prepared by them, and of certain <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> that sent them dreams and lent them their protection, and of other similar agencies; and in accordance with these things they taught that it was necessary for those who wished to enter fully into their <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, or rather into their abominations, to practice all the worst kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, on the ground that they could escape the cosmic powers, as they called them, in no other way than by discharging their <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to them all by <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> conduct.</p>

<p>10. Thus it came to pass that the malignant <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, making use of these ministers, on the one hand enslaved those that were so pitiably led astray by them to their own destruction, while on the other hand he furnished to the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> abundant opportunities for <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandering</a> the divine word, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of these men brought <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> upon the whole race of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</p>

<p>11. In this way, therefore, it came to pass that there was spread abroad in regard to us among the unbelievers of that age, the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> and most absurd suspicion that we practiced unlawful commerce with mothers and sisters, and enjoyed impious feasts. </p>

<p>12. He did not, however, long succeed in these artifices, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> established itself and in time shone with great brilliancy.</p>

<p>13. For the machinations of its enemies were refuted by its power and speedily vanished. One new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> arose after another, and the former ones always passed away, and now at one time, now at another, now in one way, now in other ways, were lost in ideas of various kinds and various forms. But the splendor of the catholic and only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is always the same, grew in magnitude and power, and reflected its <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and simplicity and freedom, and the modesty and purity of its inspired life and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to every nation both of Greeks and of Barbarians.</p>

<p>14. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> accusations which had been brought against the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>  also vanished, and there remained our teaching alone, which has prevailed over all, and which is acknowledged to be superior to all in dignity and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and in divine and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> doctrines. So that none of them now ventures to affix a base <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> upon our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or any such <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> as our ancient enemies formerly delighted to utter.</p>

<p>15. Nevertheless, in those times the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> again called forth many champions who fought in its defense against the godless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, refuting them not only with oral, but also with written arguments. </p>

<h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8. Ecclesiastical Writers.</h2>

<p>1. Among these <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a> was well known.  We have already quoted his words a number of times,  relating events which happened in the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> according to his account.</p>

<p>2. He records in five books the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> tradition of apostolic doctrine in a most simple style, and he indicates the time in which he flourished when he writes as follows concerning those that first set up <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: <q>To whom they erected cenotaphs and temples, as is done to the present day. Among whom is also Antino&uuml;s,  a slave of the <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Adrian</a>, in whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> are celebrated also the Antinoian games, which were instituted in our day. For he [i.e. <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Adrian</a>] also founded a city named after Antino&uuml;s,  and appointed <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q></p>

<p>3. At the same time also Justin, a genuine lover of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, was still continuing to busy himself with Greek literature.  He indicates this time in the Apology which he addressed to Antonine, where he writes as follows:  <q>We do not think it out of place to mention here Antino&uuml;s also, who lived in our day, and whom all were driven by fear to worship as a god, although they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> who he was and whence he came.</q></p>

<p>4. The same writer, speaking of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which took place at that time, adds the following:  <q>For in the late Jewish <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> Barcocheba, the leader of the Jewish rebellion, commanded that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> alone  should be visited with terrible punishments unless they would deny and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>5. And in the same work he shows that his conversion from Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>  was not without reason, but that it was the result of deliberation on his part. His words are as follows:  <q>For I myself, while I was delighted with the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and heard the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a>, and saw that they were afraid neither of death nor of anything else ordinarily looked upon as terrible, concluded that it was impossible that they could be living in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and pleasure. For what pleasure-loving or intemperate man, or what man that counts it good to feast on human flesh, could welcome death that he might be deprived of his enjoyments, and would not rather strive to continue permanently his present life, and to escape the notice of the rulers, instead of giving himself up to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>?</q></p>

<p>6. The same writer, moreover, relates that <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Adrian</a> having received from Serennius Granianus,  a most distinguished governor, a letter  in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, in which he stated that it was not just to slay the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> without a regular accusation and trial, merely for the sake of gratifying the outcries of the populace, sent a rescript  to Minucius Fundanus,  proconsul of Asia, commanding him to condemn no one without an indictment and a well-grounded accusation.</p>

<p>7. And he gives a copy of the epistle, preserving the original Latin in which it was written,  and prefacing it with the following words:  <q>Although from the epistle of the greatest and most illustrious <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Adrian</a>, your father, we have good ground to demand that you order judgment to be given as we have desired, yet we have asked this not because it was ordered by <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Adrian</a>, but rather because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that what we ask is just. And we have subjoined the copy of <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Adrian's</a> epistle that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we are speaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in this matter also. And this is the copy.</q></p>

<p>8. After these words the author referred to gives the rescript in Latin, which we have translated into Greek as accurately as we could.  It reads as follows:</p>

<h2 id="chapter9">Chapter 9. The Epistle of Adrian, decreeing that we should not be punished without a Trial.</h2>

<p>1. To Minucius Fundanus. I have received an epistle,  written to me by Serennius Granianus, a most illustrious man, whom you have succeeded. It does not seem right to me that the matter should be passed by without examination, lest the men  be harassed and opportunity be given to the informers for practicing villainy.</p>

<p>2. If, therefore, the inhabitants of the province can clearly sustain this petition against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> so as to give answer in a court of law, let them pursue this course alone, but let them not have resort to men's petitions and outcries. For it is far more proper, if any one wishes to make an accusation, that you should examine into it.</p>

<p>3. If any one therefore accuses them and shows that they are doing anything contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, do you pass judgment according to the heinousness of the crime.  But, by Hercules! If any one bring an accusation through mere <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, decide in regard to his criminality,  and see to it that you inflict punishment. </p>

<p>Such are the contents of <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Adrian's</a> rescript.</p>

<h2 id="chapter10">Chapter 10. The Bishops of Rome and of Alexandria during the Reign of Antoninus.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Adrian</a> having died after a reign of twenty-one years,  was succeeded in the government of the Romans by <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a>, called the Pious. In the first year of his reign <a href="../cathen/14477b.htm">Telesphorus</a>  died in the eleventh year of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a> became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>.  <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> records that <a href="../cathen/14477b.htm">Telesphorus'</a> death was made <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>,  and in the same connection he states that in the time of the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a>, <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, the founder of a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of his own, and Cerdon, the author of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, were both well known at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.  He writes as follows: </p>

<h2 id="chapter11">Chapter 11. The Heresiarchs of that Age.</h2>

<p>1. <q>For <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a>, flourished under <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pius</a>, and remained until <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>.  Cerdon  also, Marcion's  predecessor, entered the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a>, the ninth  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and made confession, and continued in this way, now teaching in secret, now making confession again, and now denounced for corrupt doctrine and withdrawing  from the assembly of the brethren.</q></p>

<p>2. These words are found in the third book of the work Against Heresies. And again in the first book he speaks as follows concerning Cerdon:  <q>A certain Cerdon, who had taken his system from the followers of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a>, and had come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a>, the ninth in the episcopal succession from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  taught that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> proclaimed by the law and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> was not the father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. For the former was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but the latter unknown; and the former was just, but the latter good.  <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> succeeded Cerdon and developed his doctrine, uttering shameless <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>.</q></p>

<p>3. The same <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> unfolds with the greatest vigor the unfathomable abyss of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus'</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in regard to matter, and reveals his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, secret and hidden like a serpent lurking in its nest.</p>

<p>4. And in addition to these men he says that there was also another that lived in that age, Marcus by name,  who was remarkably skilled in magic arts. And he describes also their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> initiations and their abominable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> in the following words: </p>

<p>5. <q>For some of them prepare a nuptial couch and perform a mystic rite with certain forms of expression addressed to those who are being initiated, and they say that it is a spiritual marriage which is celebrated by them, after the likeness of the marriages above. But others lead them to water, and while they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them they repeat the following words: Into the name of the unknown father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the mother of all things, into the one that descended upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.  Others repeat Hebrew names  in order the better to confound those who are being initiated.</q></p>

<p>6. But <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a>  having died at the close of the fourth year of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pius</a>  succeeded him in the government of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a>. In Alexandria Marcus  was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">pastor</a>, after Eumenes  had filled the office thirteen years in all. And Marcus having died after holding office ten years was succeeded by Celadion  in the government of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">church of Alexandria</a>.</p>

<p>7. And in Rome <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pius</a> died in the fifteenth year of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>  assumed the leadership of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> there. <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a> records that he himself was in Rome at this time, and that he remained there until the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of <a href="../cathen/05378a.htm">Eleutherus</a>. </p>

<p>8. But Justin  was especially prominent in those days. In the guise of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>  he preached the divine word, and contended for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in his writings. He wrote also a work against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>,  in which he states that the latter was alive at the time he wrote.</p>

<p>9. He speaks as follows:  <q>And there is a certain <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>  of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>,  who is even now still teaching his followers to think that there is some other God greater than the Creator. And by the aid of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>  he has persuaded many of every race of men  to utter <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and to deny that the maker of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is the father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to confess that some other, greater than he, was the creator.  And all who followed them are, as we have said,  called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, just as the name of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is given to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, although they may have no doctrines in common.</q></p>

<p>10. To this he adds:  <q>And we have also written a work against all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> that have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>,  which we will give you if you wish to read it.</q></p>

<p>11. But this same Justin contended most successfully against the Greeks, and addressed discourses containing an apology for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Emperor Antoninus</a>, called Pius, and to the Roman senate.  For he lived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But who and whence he was he shows in his Apology in the following words. </p>

<h2 id="chapter12">Chapter 12. The Apology of Justin addressed to Antoninus.</h2>

<p><q>To the <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Titus &AElig;lius Adrian Antoninus Pius C&aelig;sar Augustus</a>,  and to Verissimus his son,  the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and to Lucius the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>,  own son of C&aelig;sar and adopted son of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Pius</a>, a lover of learning, and to the sacred senate and to the whole Roman people, I, Justin, son of Priscus and grandson of Bacchius,  of Flavia Neapolis in Palestine, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, present this address and petition in behalf of those men of every nation who are <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, I myself being one of them.</q> And the same emperor having learned also from other brethren in Asia of the injuries of all kinds which they were suffering from the inhabitants of the province, thought it proper to address the following ordinance to the Common Assembly  of Asia.</p>\

<h2 id="chapter13">Chapter 13. The Epistle of Antoninus to the Common Assembly of Asia in Regard to our Doctrine.</h2> 

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Emperor C&aelig;sar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus</a>,  Armenicus, Pontifex Maximus, for the fifteenth time Tribune, for the third time Consul, to the Common Assembly of Asia, Greeting.</p>

<p>2. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the gods also take care that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> do not escape detection. For they would much rather punish those who will not worship them than you would.</p>

<p>3. But you throw them into confusion, and while you accuse them of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a> you only confirm them in the opinion which they hold. It would indeed be more desirable for them, when accused, to appear to die for their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than to live. Wherefore also they come off victorious when they give up their lives rather than yield <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to your commands.</p>

<p>4. And in regard to the earthquakes which have been and are still taking place,  it is not improper to admonish you who lose heart whenever they occur, and nevertheless are accustomed to compare your conduct with theirs. </p>

<p>5. They indeed become the more confident in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while you, during the whole time, neglect, in apparent <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, the other gods and the worship of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Immortal</a>, and oppress and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> even unto death the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who worship him. </p>

<p>6. But in regard to these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, many of the governors of the provinces wrote also to our most divine father, to whom he wrote in reply that they should not trouble these people unless it should appear that they were attempting something affecting the Roman government.  And to me also many have sent communications concerning these men, but I have replied to them in the same way that my father did.</p>

<p>7. But if any one still persists in bringing accusations against any of these people as such, the person who is accused shall be acquitted of the charge, even if it appear that he is one of them, but the accuser shall be punished.  Published in Ephesus in the Common Assembly of Asia.</p>

<p>8. To these things <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">Melito</a>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church of Sardis, and a man well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at that time, is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>,  as is clear from his words in the Apology which he addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Emperor Verus</a> in behalf of our doctrine.</p>

<h2 id="chapter14">Chapter 14. The Circumstances related of Polycarp, a Friend of the Apostles.</h2>

<p>1. At this time, while <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> was at the head of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a>,  <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> relates that <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, who was still alive, was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>,  and that he had a conference with <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> on a question concerning the day of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">paschal feast</a>. </p>

<p>2. And the same writer gives another account of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> which I feel constrained to add to that which has been already related in regard to him. The account is taken from the third book of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us'</a> work Against Heresies, and is as follows: </p>

<p>3. But <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>  also was not only instructed by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and acquainted with many that had seen <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but was also appointed by <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in Asia <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church of Smyrna. </p>

<p>4. We too saw him in our early youth; for he lived a long time, and died, when a very old man, a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and most illustrious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> death,  having always taught the things which he had learned from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also hands down, and which alone are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. </p>

<p>5. To these things all the Asiatic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> testify, as do also those who, down to the present time, have succeeded <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>,  who was a much more trustworthy and certain <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.  He also was in Rome in the time of <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>  and caused many to turn away from the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, proclaiming that he had received from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> this one and only system of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which has been transmitted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>6. And there are those that heard from him that John, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, going to bathe in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> and seeing <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> within, ran out of the bath-house without bathing, crying, 'Let us flee, lest even the bath fall, because <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is within.' </p>

<p>7. And <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> himself, when <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> once met him  and said, 'Do you know us?  replied, 'I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the first born of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>.' Such caution did the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> exercise that they might not even converse with any of those who perverted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also said, 'A man that is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, after the first and second admonition, reject; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> he that is such is subverted, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, being condemned of himself.' <span class="stiki" id="note251126"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse10">Titus&nbsp;3:10-11</a></span></p>

<p>8. There is also a very powerful epistle of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> written to the Philippians,  from which those that wish to do so, and that are concerned for their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, may learn the character of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Such is the account of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>.</p>

<p>9. But <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, in his above-mentioned epistle to the Philippians, which is still extant, has made use of certain testimonies drawn from the <a href="../bible/1pe000.htm">First Epistle of Peter</a>. </p>

<p>10. And when <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a>, called Pius, had completed the twenty-second year of his reign,  <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius Verus</a>, his son, who was also called Antoninus, succeeded him, together with his brother Lucius. </p>

<h2 id="chapter15">Chapter 15. Under Verus, Polycarp with Others suffered Martyrdom at Smyrna.</h2>

<p>1. At this time,  when the greatest <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> were exciting Asia, <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> ended his life by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. But I consider it most important that his death, a written account of which is still extant, should be recorded in this history.</p>

<p>2. There is a letter, written in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> over which he himself presided,  to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">parishes</a> in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>,  which relates the events that befell him, in the following words:</p>

<p>3. <q>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of God</a> which dwells in Philomelium,  and to all the parishes of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Catholic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>  in every place; mercy and peace and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> be multiplied. We write  unto you, brethren, an account of what happened to those that suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and to the blessed <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, who put an end to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, having, as it were, sealed it by his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</q></p>

<p>4. After these words, before giving the account of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, they record the events which befell the rest of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and describe the great firmness which they exhibited in the midst of their pains. For they say that the bystanders were struck with amazement when they saw them lacerated with scourges even to the innermost veins and arteries, so that the hidden inward parts of the body, both their bowels and their members, were exposed to view; and then laid upon sea-shells and certain pointed spits, and subjected to every species of punishment and of torture, and finally thrown as food to wild beasts.</p>

<p>5. And they record that the most noble Germanicus  especially distinguished himself, overcoming by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the fear of bodily death implanted by nature. When indeed the proconsul  wished to persuade him, and urged his youth, and besought him, as he was very young and vigorous, to take compassion on himself, he did not hesitate, but eagerly lured the beast toward himself, all but compelling and irritating him, in order that he might the sooner be freed from their unrighteous and lawless life.</p>

<p>6. After his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> death the whole multitude, marveling at the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> of the God-beloved <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and at the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of the whole race of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, began to cry out suddenly, <q>Away with the <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a>;  let <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> be sought.</q></p>

<p>7. And when a very great tumult arose in consequence of the cries, a certain Phrygian, Quintus  by name, who was newly come from Phrygia, seeing the beasts and the additional tortures, was smitten with cowardice and gave up the attainment of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>8. But the above-mentioned epistle shows that he, too hastily and without proper discretion, had rushed forward with others to the tribunal, but when seized had furnished a clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to all, that it is not right for such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> rashly and recklessly to expose themselves to danger. Thus did matters turn out in connection with them.</p>

<p>9. But the most admirable <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, when he first heard of these things, continued undisturbed, preserved a quiet and unshaken <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and determined to remain in the city. But being persuaded by his friends who entreated and exhorted him to retire secretly, he went out to a farm not far distant from the city and abode there with a few companions, night and day doing nothing but wrestle with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, beseeching and imploring, and asking peace for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> throughout the whole world. For this was always his custom.</p>

<p>10. And three days before his arrest, while he was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, he saw in a vision at night the pillow under his head suddenly seized by fire and consumed; and upon this awakening he immediately interpreted the vision to those that were present, almost foretelling that which was about to happen, and declaring plainly to those that were with him that it would be necessary for him for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake to die by fire.</p>

<p>11. Then, as those who were seeking him pushed the search with vigor, they say that he was again constrained by the solicitude and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brethren to go to another farm. Thither his pursuers came after no long time, and seized two of the servants there, and tortured one of them for the purpose of learning from him <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp's</a> hiding-place.</p>

<p>12. And coming late in the evening, they found him lying in an upper room, whence he might have gone to another house, but he would not, saying, <q>The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be done.</q></p>

<p>13. And when he learned that they were present, as the account says, he went down and spoke to them with a very cheerful and gentle countenance, so that those who did not already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the man thought that they beheld a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> when they observed his advanced age and the gravity and firmness of his bearing, and they marveled that so much effort should be made to capture a man like him.</p>

<p>14. But he did not hesitate, but immediately gave orders that a table should be spread for them. Then he invited them to partake of a bounteous meal, and asked of them one hour that he might <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> undisturbed. And when they had given permission, he stood up and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, being full of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, so that those who were present and heard him <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> were amazed, and many of them now repented that such a venerable and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godly</a> old man was about to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</p>

<p>15. In addition to these things the narrative concerning him contains the following account: But when at length he had brought his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to an end, after remembering all that had ever come into contact with him, small and great, famous and obscure, and the whole Catholic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout the world, the hour of departure having come, they put him upon an ass and brought him to the city, it being a great <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>.  And he was met by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>,  the captain of police,  and by his father Nicetes, who took him into their carriage, and sitting beside him endeavored to persuade him, saying, 'For what harm is there in saying, Lord C&aelig;sar, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> and saving your life?' He at first did not answer; but when they persisted, he said, 'I am not going to do what you advise me.'</p>

<p>16. And when they failed to persuade him, they uttered dreadful words, and thrust him down with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, so that as he descended from the carriage he lacerated his shin. But without turning round, he went on his way promptly and rapidly, as if nothing had happened to him, and was taken to the stadium.</p>

<p>17. But there was such a tumult in the stadium that not many heard a voice from heaven, which came to <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> as he was entering the place: 'Be strong, <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, and play the man.'  And no one saw the speaker, but many of our people heard the voice.</p>

<p>18. And when he was led forward, there was a great tumult, as they heard that <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> was taken. Finally, when he came up, the proconsul asked if he were <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>. And when he confessed that he was, he endeavored to persuade him to deny, saying, 'Have regard for your age,' and other like things, which it is their custom to say: 'Swear by the genius of C&aelig;sar;  repent and say, Away with the Atheists.'</p>

<p>19. But <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, looking with dignified countenance upon the whole crowd that was gathered in the stadium, waved his hand to them, and groaned, and raising his eyes toward heaven, said, 'Away with the Atheists.'</p>

<p>20. But when the magistrate pressed him, and said, 'Swear, and I will release you; revile <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,' <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> said, 'Fourscore and six years  have I been serving him, and he has done me no wrong; how then can I <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> my king who saved me?'</p>

<p>21. But when he again persisted, and said, 'Swear by the genius of C&aelig;sar,' <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> replied, 'If you vainly suppose that I will <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the genius of C&aelig;sar, as you say, feigning to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> who I am, hear plainly: I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. But if you desire to learn the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, assign a day and hear.'</p>

<p>22. The proconsul said, 'Persuade the people.' But <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> said, 'As for you, I thought you worthy of an explanation; for we have been taught to render to princes and authorities ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> that is due,  so long as it does not injure us;  but as for these, I do not esteem them the proper <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom to make my defense.' </p>

<p>23. But the proconsul said, 'I have wild beasts; I will throw you to them unless you repent.' But he said, 'Call them; for repentance from better to worse is a change we cannot make. But it is a noble thing to turn from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to righteousness.'</p>

<p>24. But he again said to him, 'If you despise the wild beasts, I will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to be consumed by fire, unless you repent.' But <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> said, 'You threaten a fire which burns for an hour, and after a little is quenched; for you know not the fire of the future judgment and of the eternal punishment which is reserved for the impious. But why do you delay? Do what you will.'</p>

<p>25. Saying these and other words besides, he was filled with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and his face was suffused with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so that not only was he not terrified and dismayed by the words that were spoken to him, but, on the contrary, the proconsul was amazed, and sent his herald to proclaim three times in the midst of the stadium: '<a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> has confessed that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.'</p>

<p>26. And when this was proclaimed by the herald, the whole multitude, both of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,  who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, cried out with ungovernable <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and with a great shout, 'This is the teacher of Asia, the father of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the overthrower of our gods, who teaches many not to sacrifice nor to worship.'</p>

<p>27. When they had said this, they cried out and asked the Asiarch Philip  to let a lion loose upon <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>. But he said that it was not lawful for him, since he had closed the games. Then they thought fit to cry out with one accord that <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> should be burned alive.</p>

<p>28. For it was necessary that the vision should be fulfilled which had been shown him concerning his pillow, when he saw it burning while he was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, and turned and said <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> that were with him, 'I must needs be burned alive.'</p>

<p>29. These things were done with great speed &mdash; more quickly than they were said &mdash; the crowds immediately collecting from the workshops and baths timber and fagots, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> being especially <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in the work, as is their wont.</p>

<p>30. But when the pile was ready, taking off all his upper garments, and loosing his girdle, he attempted also to remove his shoes, although he had never before done this, because of the effort which each of the faithful always made to touch his skin first; for he had been treated with all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> on account of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life even before his gray hairs came.</p>

<p>31. Forthwith then the materials prepared for the pile were placed about him; and as they were also about to nail him to the stake,  he said, 'Leave me thus; for he who has given me strength to endure the fire, will also grant me strength to remain in the fire unmoved without being secured by you with nails.' So they did not nail him, but bound him.</p>

<p>32. And he, with his hands behind him, and bound like a noble ram taken from a great flock, an acceptable burnt-offering unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, said,</p>

<p>33. 'Father of your beloved and blessed Son  <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, through whom we have received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of you, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and of powers and of the whole creation and of the entire race of the righteous who live in your <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">presence</a>, I bless you that you have deemed me worthy of this day and hour, that I might receive a portion in the number of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, in the cup of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, unto resurrection of eternal life,  both of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of body, in the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>34. Among these may I be received before you this day, in a rich and acceptable <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, as you, the faithful and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have beforehand prepared and revealed, and have fulfilled.</p>

<p>35. Wherefore I praise you also for everything; I bless you, I glorify you, through the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, your beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, through whom, with him, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> unto you, both now and for the ages to come, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.'</p>

<p>36. When he had offered up his <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> and had finished his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the firemen lighted the fire and as a great flame blazed out, we, to whom it was given to see, saw a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonder</a>, and we were preserved that we might relate what happened to the others.</p>

<p>37. For the fire presented the appearance of a vault, like the sail of a vessel filled by the wind, and made a wall about the body of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>,  and it was in the midst not like flesh burning, but like gold and silver refined in a furnace. For we perceived such a fragrant odor, as of the fumes of frankincense or of some other precious spices.</p>

<p>38. So at length the lawless men, when they saw that the body could not be consumed by the fire, commanded an executioner  to approach and pierce him with the sword.</p>

<p>39. And when he had done this there came forth a quantity of blood  so that it extinguished the fire; and the whole crowd marveled that there should be such a difference between the unbelievers and the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, of whom this man also was one, the most wonderful teacher in our times, apostolic and prophetic, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Catholic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>  in <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>. For every word which came from his mouth was accomplished and will be accomplished.</p>

<p>40. But the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealous and envious</a> Evil One, the adversary of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">race of the righteous</a>, when he saw the greatness of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and his blameless life from the beginning, and when he saw him crowned with the crown of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and bearing off an incontestable prize, took care that not even his body should be taken away by us, although many desired to do it and to have communion with his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> flesh.</p>

<p>41. Accordingly certain ones secretly suggested to Nicetes, the father of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and brother of Alce,  that he should plead with the magistrate not to give up his body, 'lest,' it was said, 'they should abandon the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">crucified One</a> and begin to worship this man.'  They said these things at the suggestion and impulse of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who also watched as we were about to take it from the fire, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that we shall never be able either to forsake <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who suffered for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the whole world of those that are <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>, or to worship any other.</p>

<p>42. For we worship him who is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and imitators of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as they deserve on account of their matchless affection for their own king and teacher. May we also be made partakers and fellow-disciples with them.</p>

<p>43. The centurion, therefore, when he saw the contentiousness exhibited by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, placed him in the midst and burned him, as was their custom. And so we afterwards gathered up his bones, which were more valuable than precious stones and more to be esteemed than gold, and laid them in a suitable place.</p>

<p>44. There the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> will permit us to come together as we are able, in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/10709a.htm">birthday of his martyrdom</a>,  for the commemoration of those who have already fought and for the training and preparation of those who shall hereafter do the same.</p>

<p>45. Such are the events that befell the blessed <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> with the eleven  from <a href="../cathen/11793a.htm">Philadelphia</a>. This one man is remembered more than the others by all, so that even by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> he is talked about in every place.</p>

<p>46. Of such an end was the admirable and apostolic <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> deemed worthy, as recorded by the brethren of the church of Smyrna in their epistle which we have mentioned. In the same volume  concerning him are subjoined also other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> which took place in the same city, Smyrna, about the same period of time with <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Among them also Metrodorus, who appears to have been a <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselyte</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionitic sect</a>, suffered death by fire.</p>

<p>47. A celebrated <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of those times was a certain man named <a href="../cathen/12105a.htm">Pionius</a>. Those who desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his several confessions, and the boldness of his speech, and his apologies in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> before the people and the rulers, and his instructive addresses and, moreover, his greetings to those who had yielded to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and the words of encouragement which he addressed to the brethren who came to visit him in prison, and the tortures which he endured in addition, and besides these the sufferings and the nailings, and his firmness on the pile, and his death after all the extraordinary trials, &mdash; those we refer to that epistle which has been given in the Martyrdoms of the Ancients,  collected by us, and which contains a very full account of him.</p>

<p>48. And there are also records extant of others that suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamus</a>, a city of Asia&mdash;of Carpus and Papylus, and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> named Agathonice, who, after many and illustrious testimonies, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> ended their lives. </p>

<h2 id="chapter16">Chapter 16. Justin the Philosopher preaches the Word of Christ in Rome and suffers Martyrdom.</h2>

<p>1. About this time  Justin, who was mentioned by us just above,  after he had addressed a second work in behalf of our doctrines to the rulers already named,  was crowned with divine <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>,  in consequence of a plot laid against him by <a href="../cathen/04484b.htm">Crescens</a>,  a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> who emulated the life and manners of the <a href="../cathen/04582a.htm">Cynics</a>, whose name he bore. After Justin had frequently refuted him in public discussions he won by his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> the prize of victory, dying in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which he preached.</p>

<p>2. And he himself, a man most learned in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in his Apology already referred to  clearly predicts how this was about to happen to him, although it had not yet occurred.</p>

<p>3. His words are as follows:  I, too,  therefore, expect to be plotted against and put in the stocks  by some one of those whom I have named, or perhaps by <a href="../cathen/04484b.htm">Crescens</a>, that unphilosophical and vainglorious man. For the man is not worthy to be called a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> who publicly bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against those concerning whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing, declaring, for the sake of captivating and pleasing the multitude, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistical</a> and impious. </p>

<p>4. Doing this he <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> greatly. For if he assails us without having read the teachings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is thoroughly depraved, and is much worse than the illiterate, who often guard against discussing and bearing false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> about matters which they do not understand. And if he has read them and does not understand the majesty that is in them, or, understanding it, does these things in order that he may not be suspected of being an adherent, he is far more base and totally depraved, being enslaved to vulgar applause and irrational fear.</p>

<p>5. For I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that when I proposed certain questions of the sort and asked him in regard to them, I learned and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that he indeed <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing. And to show that I speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> I am ready, if these disputations have not been reported to you, to discuss the questions again in your presence. And this indeed would be an act worthy of an emperor.</p>

<p>6. But if my questions and his answers have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you, it is obvious to you that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing about our affairs; or if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, but does not dare to speak because of those who hear him, he shows himself to be, as I have already said,  not a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, but a vainglorious man, who indeed does not even regard that most admirable saying of Socrates.  These are the words of Justin.</p>

<p>7. And that he met his death as he had predicted that he would, in consequence of the machinations of <a href="../cathen/04484b.htm">Crescens</a>, is stated by <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>,  a man who early in life lectured upon the sciences of the Greeks and won no little fame in them, and who has left a great many monuments of himself in his writings. He records this fact in his work against the Greeks, where he writes as follows:  <q>And that most admirable Justin declared with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were like <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>.</q></p>

<p>8. Then, after making some remarks about the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, he continues as follows:  <a href="../cathen/04484b.htm">Crescens</a>, indeed, who made his nest in the great city, surpassed all in his unnatural <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and was wholly devoted to the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>.</p>

<p>9. And he who taught that death should be despised, was himself so greatly in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of it that he endeavored to inflict death, as if it were a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, upon Justin, because the latter, when preaching the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttons</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a>. And such was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Justin's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter17">Chapter 17. The Martyrs whom Justin mentions in his Own Work.</h2>

<p>1. The same man, before his conflict, mentions in his first Apology  others that suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> before him, and most fittingly records the following events.</p>

<p>2. He writes thus:  A certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> lived with a dissolute husband; she herself, too, having formerly been of the same character. But when she came to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the teachings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, she became temperate, and endeavored to persuade her husband likewise to be temperate, repeating the teachings, and declaring the punishment in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> which shall come upon those who do not live temperately and conformably to right reason.</p>

<p>3. But he, continuing in the same excesses, alienated his wife by his conduct. For she finally, thinking it wrong to live as a wife with a man who, contrary to the law of nature and right, sought every possible means of pleasure, desired to be <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> from him.</p>

<p>4. And when she was earnestly entreated by her friends, who counseled her still to remain with him, on the ground that her husband might some time give hope of amendment, she did <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">violence</a> to herself and remained.</p>

<p>5. But when her husband had gone to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, and was reported to be conducting himself still worse, she&mdash; in order that she might not, by continuing in <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">wedlock</a>, and by sharing his board and bed, become a partaker in his lawlessness and impiety&mdash; gave him what we  call a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> and left him.</p>

<p>6. But her noble and excellent husband&mdash;instead of rejoicing, as he ought to have done, that she had given up those actions which she had formerly recklessly committed with the servants and hirelings, when she delighted in <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> and in every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and that she desired him likewise to give them up&mdash;when she had gone from him contrary to his wish, brought an accusation concerning her, declaring that she was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</p>

<p>7. And she petitioned you, the emperor, that she might be permitted first to set her affairs in order, and afterwards, after the settlement of her affairs, to make her defense against the accusation. And this you granted.</p>

<p>8. But he who had once been her husband, being no longer able to prosecute her, directed his attacks against a certain Ptolem&aelig;us,  who had been her teacher in the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and whom Urbicius  had punished. Against him he proceeded in the following manner:</p>

<p>9. He persuaded a centurion who was his friend to cast Ptolem&aelig;us into prison, and to take him and ask him this only: was he a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? And when Ptolem&aelig;us, who was a lover of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and not of a deceitful and false disposition, confessed that he was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, the centurion bound him and punished him for a long time in the prison.</p>

<p>10. And finally, when the man was brought before Urbicius he was likewise asked this question only: was he a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? And again, conscious of the benefits which he enjoyed through the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he confessed his schooling in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">divine virtue</a>.</p>

<p>11. For whoever denies that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, either denies because he despises <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, or he avoids confession because he is conscious that he is unworthy and an alien to it; neither of which is the case with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</p>

<p>12. And when Urbicius commanded that he be led away to punishment, a certain Lucius,  who was also a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, seeing judgment so <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> passed, said to Urbicius, 'Why have you punished this man who is not an adulterer, nor a fornicator, nor a murderer, nor a thief, nor a robber, nor has been convicted of committing any crime at all, but has confessed that he bears the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? You do not judge, O Urbicius, in a manner befitting the <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Emperor Pius</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">philosophical son</a>  of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">C&aelig;sar</a>, or the sacred senate.'</p>

<p>13. And without making any other reply, he said to Lucius, 'You also seem to me to be one.' And when Lucius said, 'Certainly,' he again commanded that he too should be led away to punishment. But he professed his thanks, for he was liberated, he added, from such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> rulers and was going to the good Father and King, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And still a third having come forward was condemned to be punished.</p>

<p>14. To this, Justin fittingly and consistently adds the words which we quoted above,  saying, <q>I, too, therefore expect to be plotted against by some one of those whom I have named,</q> etc. </p>

<h2 id="chapter18">Chapter 18. The Works of Justin which have come down to us.</h2>

<p>1. This writer has left us a great many monuments of a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and practiced in divine things, which are replete with profitable matter of every kind. To them we shall refer the studious, noting as we proceed those that have come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. </p>

<p>2. There is a certain discourse  of his in defense of our doctrine addressed to <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus surnamed the Pious</a>, and to his sons, and to the Roman senate. Another work contains his second Apology  in behalf of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which he offered to him who was the successor of the emperor mentioned and who bore the same name, <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Antoninus Verus</a>, the one whose times we are now recording.</p>

<p>3. Also another work against the Greeks,  in which he discourses at length upon most of the questions at issue between us and the Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and discusses the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. It is not necessary for me to add any of these things here.</p>

<p>4. And still another work of his against the Greeks has come down to us, to which he gave the title Refutation. And besides these another, On the Sovereignty of God,  which he establishes not only from our Scriptures, but also from the books of the Greeks.</p>

<p>5. Still further, a work entitled Psaltes,  and another disputation On the Soul, in which, after propounding various questions concerning the problem under discussion, he gives the opinions of the Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, promising to refute it, and to present his own view in another work.</p>

<p>6. He composed also a dialogue against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,  which he held in the city of Ephesus with Trypho, a most distinguished man among the Hebrews of that day. In it he shows how the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> urged him on to the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and with what earnestness he had formerly pursued <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies, and how ardent a search he had made for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. </p>

<p>7. And he records of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the same work, that they were plotting against the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, asserting the same things against Trypho: <q>Not only did you not repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> which you had committed, but you selected at that time chosen men, and you sent them out from Jerusalem through all the land, to announce that the godless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had made its appearance, and to accuse them of those things which all that are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of us say against us, so that you become the causes not only of your own <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, but also of all other men's.</q> </p>

<p>8. He writes also that even down to his time <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> shone in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  And he mentions the Apocalypse of John, saying distinctly that it was the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">apostle's</a>.  He also refers to certain prophetic declarations, and accuses Trypho on the ground that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had cut them out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>.  A great many other works of his are still in the hands of many of the brethren. </p>

<p>9. And the discourses of the man were thought so worthy of study even by the ancients, that <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> quotes his words: for instance, in the fourth book of his work Against Heresies, where he writes as follows:  <q>And Justin well says in his work against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, that he would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> himself if he had preached another God besides the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a></q>; and again in the fifth book of the same work he says:  <q>And Justin well said that before the coming of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> never dared to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  because he did not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his condemnation.</q></p>

<p>10. These things I have deemed it necessary to say for the sake of stimulating the studious to peruse his works with diligence. So much concerning him.</p>

<h2 id="chapter19">Chapter 19. The Rulers of the Churches of Rome and Alexandria during the Reign of Verus.</h2>

<p>1. In the eighth year of the <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">above-mentioned reign</a>  <a href="../cathen/03144c.htm">Soter</a>  succeeded <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>  as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of the church of Rome</a>, after the latter had held office eleven years in all. But when Celadion  had presided over the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">church of Alexandria</a> for fourteen years he was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agripinnus</a>. </p>

<h2 id="chapter20">Chapter 20. The Rulers of the Church of Antioch.</h2>

<p>1. At that time also in the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">church of Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus</a>  was well known as the sixth from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For Cornelius,  who succeeded Hero,  was the fourth, and after him Eros,  the fifth in order, had held the office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter21">Chapter 21. The Ecclesiastical Writers that flourished in Those Days.</h2>

<p>1. At that time there flourished in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a>, whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from what has gone before,  and <a href="../cathen/05010a.htm">Dionysius</a>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Corinth, and another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Pinytus of Crete,  and besides these, Philip,  and Apolinarius,  and <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">Melito</a>,  and Musanus,  and Modestus,  and finally, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>.  From them has come down to us in writing, the sound and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> received from apostolic tradition. </p>

<h2 id="chapter22">Chapter 22. Hegesippus and the Events which he mentions.</h2>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a> in the five books of Memoirs  which have come down to us has left a most complete record of his own views. In them he states that on a journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he met a great many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and that he received the same doctrine from all. It is fitting to hear what he says after making some remarks about the epistle of Clement to the Corinthians.</p>

<p>2. His words are as follows: And the church of Corinth continued in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> until Primus  was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. I conversed with them on my way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and abode with the Corinthians many days, during which we were mutually refreshed in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine.</p>

<p>3. And when I had come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> I remained there until <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>,  whose <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> was <a href="../cathen/05378a.htm">Eleutherus</a>. And <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/03144c.htm">Soter</a>, and he by <a href="../cathen/05378a.htm">Eleutherus</a>. In every succession, and in every city that is held which is preached by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</p>

<p>4. The same author also describes the beginnings of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which arose in his time, in the following words: And after <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the Just</a> had suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> had also on the same account, Symeon, the son of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> uncle, Clopas,  was appointed the next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. All proposed him as second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> because he was a <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">cousin of the Lord</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore,  they called the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, for it was not yet corrupted by vain discourses.</p>

<p>5. But Thebuthis,  because he was not made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, began to corrupt it. He also was sprung from the seven <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>  among the people, like <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a>,  from whom came the <a href="../cathen/13797a.htm">Simonians</a>, and Cleobius,  from whom came the Cleobians, and Dositheus,  from whom came the <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheans</a>, and Gorth&aelig;us,  from whom came the Goratheni, and Masbotheus,  from whom came the Masboth&aelig;ans. From them sprang the Menandrianists,  and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionists</a>,  and Carpocratians, and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilidians</a>, and Saturnilians. Each introduced privately and separately his own peculiar opinion. From them came <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">false Christs</a>, <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who divided the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> by corrupt doctrines uttered against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and against his <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>6. The same writer also records the ancient <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which arose among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in the following words: <q>There were, moreover, various opinions in the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, among the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. The following were those that were opposed to the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>: <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a>, <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galileans</a>, Hemerobaptists,  Masboth&aelig;ans, <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>.</q> </p>

<p>7. And he wrote of many other matters, which we have in part already mentioned, introducing the accounts in their appropriate places. And from the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to the Hebrews he quotes some passages in the Hebrew tongue,  showing that he was a <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>,  and he mentions other matters as taken from the unwritten tradition of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>8. And not only he, but also <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> and the whole company of the ancients, called the Proverbs of Solomon All-virtuous Wisdom.  And when speaking of the books called Apocrypha, he records that some of them were composed in his day by certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But let us now pass on to another.</p>

<h2 id="chapter23">Chapter 23. Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, and the Epistles which he wrote.</h2> 

<p>1. And first we must speak of <a href="../cathen/05010a.htm">Dionysius</a>, who was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> in <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, and communicated freely of his inspired labors not only to his own people, but also to those in foreign lands, and rendered the greatest service to all in the catholic epistles which he wrote to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>.</p>

<p>2. Among these is the one addressed to the Laced&aelig;monians,  containing instruction in the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and an admonition to peace and unity; the one also addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, exciting them to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to the life prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which he accuses them of esteeming lightly, as if they had almost <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> since the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of their ruler Publius,  which had taken place during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of those days.</p>

<p>3. He mentions <a href="../cathen/12589b.htm">Quadratus</a>  also, stating that he was appointed their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> after the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Publius, and testifying that through his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> they were brought together again and their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> revived. He records, moreover, that <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>,  who was <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, according to the statement in the Acts of the Apostles,  first obtained the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of the church at Athens.</p>

<p>4. And there is extant another epistle of his addressed to the <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedians</a>,  in which he attacks the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and stands fast by the canon of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>5. Writing also to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/06654a.htm">Gortyna</a>,  together with the other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">parishes</a> in Crete, he commends their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Philip,  because of the many acts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which are testified to as performed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> under him, and he warns them to be on their guard against the aberrations of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>6. And writing to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/01380d.htm">Amastris</a>,  together with those in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, he refers to Bacchylides  and Elpistus, as having urged him to write, and he adds explanations of passages of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, and mentions their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Palmas  by name. He gives them much advice also in regard to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriage</a> and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and commands them to receive those who come back again after any fall, whether it be delinquency or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. </p>

<p>7. Among these is inserted also another epistle addressed to the Cnosians,  in which he exhorts Pinytus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">parish</a>, not to lay upon the brethren a grievous and compulsory burden in regard to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, but to have regard to the weakness of the multitude.</p>

<p>8. Pinytus, replying to this epistle, admires and commends Dionysius, but exhorts him in turn to impart some time more solid food, and to feed the people under him, when he wrote again, with more advanced teaching, that they might not be fed continually on these milky doctrines and imperceptibly grow old under a training calculated for children. In this epistle also Pinytus' <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and his care for the welfare of those placed under him, his learning and his comprehension of divine things, are revealed as in a most perfect image.</p>

<p>9. There is extant also another epistle written by Dionysius to the Romans, and addressed to <a href="../cathen/03144c.htm">Soter</a>,  who was <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop</a> at that time. We cannot do better than to subjoin some passages from this epistle, in which he commends the practice of the Romans which has been retained down to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in our own days. His words are as follows:</p>

<p>10. <q>For from the beginning it has been your practice to do good to all the brethren in various ways, and to send <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">contributions</a> to many <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> in every city. Thus relieving the want of the needy, and making provision for the brethren in the mines by the gifts which you have sent from the beginning, you Romans keep up the hereditary customs of the Romans, which your blessed <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/03144c.htm">Soter</a> has not only maintained, but also added to, furnishing an abundance of supplies to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and encouraging the brethren from abroad with blessed words, as a loving father his children.</q></p>

<p>11. In this same epistle he makes mention also of Clement's epistle to the Corinthians,  showing that it had been the custom from the beginning to read it in the church. His words are as follows: <q>Today we have passed the Lord's holy day, in which we have read your epistle. From it, whenever we read it, we shall always be able to draw advice, as also from the former epistle, which was written to us through Clement.</q></p>

<p>12. The same writer also speaks as follows concerning his own epistles, alleging that they had been mutilated: <q>As the brethren desired me to write epistles, I wrote. And these epistles the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> have filled with tares, cutting out some things and adding others.  For them a woe is reserved.  It is, therefore, not to be wondered at if some have attempted to adulterate the Lord's writings also,  since they have formed designs even against writings which are of less account.</q> </p>

<p>There is extant, in addition to these, another epistle of Dionysius, written to Chrysophora,  a most faithful sister. In it he writes what is suitable, and imparts to her also the proper spiritual food. So much concerning Dionysius.</p>

<h2 id="chapter24">Chapter 24. Theophilus Bishop of Antioch.</h2>

<p>1. Of <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus</a>,  whom we have mentioned as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">church of Antioch</a>,  three elementary works addressed to Autolycus are extant; also another writing entitled <em>Against the Heresy of Hermogenes</em>,  in which he makes use of testimonies from the Apocalypse of John, and finally certain other <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> books. </p>

<p>2. And as the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, no less then than at other times, were like tares, destroying the pure harvest of apostolic teaching, the pastors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> everywhere hastened to restrain them as wild beasts from the fold of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, at one time by <a href="../cathen/01144b.htm">admonitions</a> and exhortations to the brethren, at another time by contending more openly against them in oral discussions and refutations, and again by correcting their opinions with most accurate <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> in written works.</p>

<p>3. And that <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus</a> also, with the others, contended against them, is manifest from a certain discourse of no common merit written by him against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>.  This work too, with the others of which we have spoken, has been preserved to the present day.</p>

<p>Maximinus,  the seventh from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">church of Antioch</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter25">Chapter 25. Philip and Modestus.</h2>

<p>Philip who, as we learn from the words of Dionysius,  was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the parish of <a href="../cathen/06654a.htm">Gortyna</a>, likewise wrote a most elaborate work against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>,  as did also <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>  and Modestus.  The last named has exposed the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the man more clearly than the rest to the view of all. There are a number of others also whose works are still presented by a great many of the brethren.</p>

<h2 id="chapter26">Chapter 26. Melito and the Circumstances which he records.</h2>

<p>1. In those days also <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">Melito</a>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the parish in <a href="../cathen/13472a.htm">Sardis</a>, and Apolinarius,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Hierapolis, enjoyed great distinction. Each of them on his own part addressed apologies in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the above-mentioned emperor  of the Romans who was reigning at that time.</p>

<p>2. The following works of these writers have come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Of <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">Melito</a>,  the two books  <em>On the Passover</em>,  and one <em>On the Conduct of Life and the Prophets</em>,  the discourse <em>On the Church</em>,  and one <em>On the Lord's Day</em>,  still further one <em>On the Faith of Man</em>,  and one <em>On his Creation</em>,  another also <em>On the Obedience of Faith</em>, and one <em>On the Senses</em>;  besides these the work <em>On the Soul and Body</em>,  and that <em>On Baptism</em>,  and the one <em>On Truth</em>,  and <em>On the Creation and Generation of Christ</em>;  his discourse also <em>On Prophecy</em>,  and that <em>On Hospitality</em>;  still further, <em>The Key</em>,  and the books <em>On the Devil and the Apocalypse of John</em>,  and the work <em>On the Corporeality of God</em>,  and finally the book addressed to <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a>. </p>

<p>3. In the books <em>On the Passover</em> he indicates the time at which he wrote, beginning with these words: <q>While Servilius Paulus was proconsul of Asia, at the time when Sagaris suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, there arose in <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> a great strife concerning the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, which fell according to rule in those days; and these were written.</q> </p>

<p>4. And <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> refers to this work in his own discourse <em>On the Passover</em>,  which, he says, he wrote on occasion of <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">Melito's</a> work.</p>

<p>5. But in his book addressed to the emperor he records that the following events happened to us under him: <q>For, what never before happened,  the race of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> is now suffering <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, being driven about in Asia by new decrees. For the shameless informers and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveters</a> of the property of others, taking occasion from the decrees, openly carry on <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> night and day, despoiling those who are guilty of no wrong.</q> And a little further on he says: If these things are done by your command, well and good. For a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> ruler will never take <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> measures; and we indeed gladly accept the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of such a death.</p>

<p>6. But this request alone we present to you, that you would yourself first examine the authors of such strife, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> judge whether they be worthy of death and punishment, or of safety and quiet. But if, on the other hand, this counsel and this new decree, which is not fit to be executed even against barbarian enemies, be not from you, much more do we beseech you not to leave us exposed to such lawless plundering by the populace.</p>

<p>7. Again he adds the following:  For our <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> formerly flourished among the Barbarians; but having sprung up among the nations under your rule, during the great reign of your ancestor <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, it became to your empire especially a blessing of auspicious omen. For from that time the power of the Romans has grown in greatness and splendor. To this power you have succeeded, as the desired possessor,  and such shall you continue with your son, if you guard the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which grew up with the empire and which came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> with <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>; that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which your ancestors also <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> along with the other <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a>.</p>

<p>8. And a most convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that our doctrine flourished for the good of an empire happily begun, is this &mdash; that there has no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> happened since <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus'</a> reign, but that, on the contrary, all things have been splendid and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of all.</p>

<p>9. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> and <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, alone, persuaded by certain <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a>, have wished to <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> our doctrine, and from them it has come to pass that the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>  has been handed down, in consequence of an unreasonable practice which prevails of bringing <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> accusations against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. </p>

<p>10. But your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> fathers corrected their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, having frequently rebuked in writing  many who dared to attempt new measures against them. Among them your grandfather Adrian appears to have written to many others, and also to Fundanus,  the proconsul and governor of Asia. And your father, when you also were ruling with him, wrote to the cities, forbidding them to take any new measures against us; among the rest to the <a href="../cathen/09004b.htm">Lariss&aelig;ans</a>, to the Thessalonians, to the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, and to all the Greeks. </p>

<p>11. And as for you&mdash;since your opinions respecting the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>  are the same as theirs, and indeed much more benevolent and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> &mdash; we are the more persuaded that you will do all that we ask of you. These words are found in the above-mentioned work.</p>

<p>12. But in the Extracts  made by him the same writer gives at the beginning of the introduction a catalogue of the acknowledged books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which it is necessary to quote at this point. He writes as follows:</p>

<p>13. <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">Melito</a> to his brother Onesimus,  greeting: Since you have often, in your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the word, expressed a wish to have extracts made from the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> and concerning our entire <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and has also desired to have an accurate statement of the ancient book, as regards their number and their order, I have endeavored to perform the task, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and your desire to gain information in regard to the word, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you, in your yearning after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, esteem these things above all else, struggling to attain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>14. Accordingly when I went East and came to the place where these things were preached and done, I learned accurately the <a href="../cathen/03267a.htm">books of the Old Testament</a>, and send them to you as written below. Their names are as follows: Of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">five books</a>: Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, <a href="../cathen/09207a.htm">Leviticus</a>,  <a href="../cathen/04761b.htm">Deuteronomy</a>; <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Jesus Nave</a>, Judges, Ruth; of <a href="../cathen/08647b.htm">Kings</a>, four books; of Chronicles, two; the Psalms of David,  the Proverbs of Solomon, Wisdom also,  Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Job; of Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah; of the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, one book ; Daniel, Ezekiel, Esdras.  From which also I have made the extracts, dividing them into six books. Such are the words of <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">Melito</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter27">Chapter 27. Apolinarius, Bishop of the Church of Hierapolis.</h2>

<p>A number of works of Apolinarius  have been preserved by many, and the following have reached us: the Discourse addressed to the above-mentioned emperor,  five books Against the Greeks,  On Truth, a first and second book,  and those which he subsequently wrote against the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">heresy of the Phrygians</a>,  which not long afterwards came out with its innovations,  but at that time was, as it were, in its incipiency, since <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, with his <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophetesses</a>, was then laying the foundations of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter28">Chapter 28. Musanus and His Writings.</h2>

<p>And as for Musanus,  whom we have mentioned among the foregoing writers, a certain very elegant discourse is extant, which was written by him against some brethren that had gone over to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the so-called <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>,  which had recently sprung up, and which introduced a strange and pernicious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. It is said that <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> was the author of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter29">Chapter 29. The Heresy of Tatian.</h2> 

<p>1. He is the one whose words we quoted a little above  in regard to that admirable man, Justin, and whom we stated to have been a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> declares this in the first book of his work  <em>Against Heresies</em>, where he writes as follows concerning both him and his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>: </p>

<p>2. Those who are called <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>,  and who sprung from Saturninus  and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, preached celibacy, setting aside the original arrangement of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and tacitly censuring him who made male and female for the propagation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. They introduced also abstinence from the things called by them animate,  thus showing ingratitude to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who made all things. And they deny the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a>. </p>

<p>3. But this has been only recently discovered by them, a certain <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> being the first to introduce this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. He was a hearer of Justin, and expressed no such opinion while he was with him, but after the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the latter he left the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and becoming exalted with the thought of being a teacher, and puffed up with the idea that he was superior to others, he established a peculiar type of doctrine of his own, inventing certain invisible <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a> like the followers of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>,  while, like <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and Saturninus, he pronounced marriage to be corruption and fornication. His argument against the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, however, he devised for himself. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> at that time wrote thus.</p>

<p>4. But a little later a certain man named Severus  put new strength into the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and thus brought it about that those who took their origin from it were called, after him, Severians.</p>

<p>5. They, indeed, use the Law and Prophets and <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, but interpret in their own way the utterances of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>. And they abuse <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul the apostle</a> and reject his epistles, and do not accept even the Acts of the Apostles.</p>

<p>6. But their original founder, <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, formed a certain combination and collection of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how,  to which he gave the title  <em>Diatessaron</em>,  and which is still in the hands of some. But they say that he ventured to paraphrase certain words of the apostle,  in order to improve their style.</p>

<p>7. He has left a great many writings. Of these the one most in use among many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is his celebrated  <em>Address to the Greeks</em>,  which also appears to be the best and most useful of all his works. In it he deals with the most ancient times, and shows that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were older than all the celebrated men among the Greeks.  So much in regard to these men.</p>

<h2 id="chapter30">Chapter 30. Bardesanes the Syrian and his Extant Works.</h2>

<p>1. In the same reign, as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> were abounding in the region between the rivers,  a certain <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a>,  a most able man and a most skillful disputant in the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac tongue</a>, having composed dialogues against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> followers and against certain others who were authors of various opinions, committed them to writing in his own language, together with many other works. His pupils,  of whom he had very many (for he was a powerful defender of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>), translated these productions from the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a> into Greek.</p>

<p>2. Among them there is also his most able dialogue <em>On Fate</em>,  addressed to <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a>, and other works which they say he wrote on occasion of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which arose at that time. </p>

<p>3. He indeed was at first a follower of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>,  but afterward, having rejected his teaching and having refuted most of his fictions, he fancied that he had come over to the more correct opinion. Nevertheless he did not entirely wash off the filth of the old <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. </p>

<p>About this time also <a href="../cathen/03144c.htm">Soter</a>,  <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of the Church of Rome</a>, departed this life.</p>
