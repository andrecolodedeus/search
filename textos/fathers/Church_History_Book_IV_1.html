<h1>Church History (Book IV)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. After Jovian's Death, Valentinian is proclaimed Emperor, and takes his Brother Valens as Colleague in the Empire; Valentinian holds the Orthodox Faith, but Valens is an Arian.</h2>

<p>The Emperor Jovian having died, as we have said, at Dadastana, in his own consulate and that of Varronian his son on the 17th of February, the army leaving Galatia arrived at Nic&aelig;a in Bithynia in seven days' march, and there unanimously proclaimed Valentinian emperor, on the 25th of February, in the same consulate. He was a Pannonian by race, a native of the city of Cibalis, and being entrusted with a military command, had displayed great skill in tactics. He was moreover endowed with such greatness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that he always appeared superior to any degree of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> he might have attained. As soon as they had created him emperor, he proceeded immediately to Constantinople; and thirty days after his own possession of the imperial dignity, he made his brother Valens his colleague in the empire. They both professed <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but did not hold the same <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> creed: for Valentinian respected the Nicene Creed; but Valens was prepossessed in favor of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> opinions. And this prejudice was caused by his having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Eudoxius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople. Each of them was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the views of his own party; but when they had attained sovereign power, they manifested very different dispositions. For previously in the reign of Julian, when Valentinian was a military tribune, and Valens held a command in the emperor's guards, they both <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for being constrained to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, they chose rather to give up their military rank than to do so and renounce <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.  Julian, however, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the men to the state, retained them in their respective places, as did also Jovian, his successor in the empire. Later on, being invested with imperial authority, they were in accord in the management of public affairs, but as regards <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, as I have said, they behaved themselves very differently: for Valentinian while he favored those who agreed with him in sentiment, offered no <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>; but Valens, in his anxiety to promote the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, grievously disturbed those who differed from them, as the course of our history will show. Now at that time Liberius presided over the Roman church; and at Alexandria Athanasius was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Homoousians, while Lucius had been constituted George's successor by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. At <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> Euzo&iuml;us was at the head of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>: but the Homoousians were divided into two parties, of one of which Paulinus was chief, and Melitius of the other. Cyril was again constituted over the church at Jerusalem. The churches at Constantinople were under the government of Eudoxius, who openly taught the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, but the Homoousians had but one small edifice in the city wherein to hold their assemblies. Those of the Macedonian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> who had dissented from the <a href="../cathen/01079b.htm">Acacians</a> at Seleucia, then retained their churches in every city. Such was the state of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs at that time.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Valentinian goes into the West; Valens remains at Constantinople, and grants the Request of the Macedonians to hold a Synod, but persecutes the Adherents of the 'Homoousion.'</h2>

<p>Of the emperors one, i.e. Valentinian, speedily went to the western parts of the empire; for the exigencies of affairs required his presence there: meanwhile Valens, residing at Constantinople, was addressed by most of the prelates of the Macedonion <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, requesting that another Synod might be convened for the correction of the creed. The emperor supposing they agreed in sentiment with Eudoxius and Acacius, gave them permission to do so: they therefore made preparations for assembling in the city of Lampsacus. But Valens proceeded with the utmost dispatch toward <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, fearing lest the Persians should violate the treaty into which they had entered for thirty years in the reign of Jovian, and invade the Roman territories. They however remained quiet; and Valens employed this season of external tranquillity to prosecute a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of extermination against all who acknowledged the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a>.</em> Paulinus their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, because of his eminent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, he left unmolested. Melitius he punished with exile: and all the rest, as many as refused to communicate with Euzo&iuml;us, he drove out from the churches in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and subjected to various losses and punishments. It is even affirmed that he caused many to be drowned in the river Orontes, which flows by that city.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. While Valens persecutes the Orthodox Christiansin the East, a Usurper arises at Constantinople named Procopius: and at the Same Time an Earthquake and Inundation take Place and injure Several Cities.</h2>

<p>While Valens was thus occupied in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, there arose a usurper at Constantinople named Procopius; who having collected a large body of troops in a very short time, meditated an expedition against the emperor. This intelligence created extreme solicitude in the emperor's mind and checked for a while the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> he had commenced against all who dared to differ from him in opinion. And while the commotions of a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> were painfully anticipated, an earthquake occurred which did much damage to many cities. The sea also changed its accustomed boundaries, and overflowed to such an extent in some places, that vessels might sail where roads had previously <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>; and it retired so much from other places, that the ground became dry. These events happened in the first consulate of the two emperors.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Macedonians hold a Synod at Lampsacus, during a Period of Both Secular and Ecclesiastical Agitation; and after confirming the Antiochian Creed, and anathematizing that promulgated at Ariminum, they again ratify the Deposition of Acacius and Eudoxius.</h2>

<p>While these events were taking place there could be no peace either in the church or in the state. Now those who had been empowered by the emperor to hold a council assembled at Lampsacus in the consulate just mentioned: this was seven years after the council of Seleucia. There, after confirming the <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antiochian</a> Creed, to which they had subscribed at Seleucia,  they <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> that which had been set forth at Ariminum  by their former associates in opinion. They moreover again condemned the party of Acacius and Eudoxius, and declared their deposition to have been just.  The civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which was then impending prevented Eudoxius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople from either gainsaying or revenging these determinations. Wherefore Eleusius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a> and his adherents became for a little while the stronger party; inasmuch as they supported the views of Macedonius, which although before but obscurely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, acquired great publicity through the Synod at Lampsacus. This Synod, I think, was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the increase of the Macedonians in the Hellespont; for Lampsacus is situated in one of the narrow bays of the Hellespont. Such was the issue of this council.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Engagement between Valens and Procopius near Nacolia in Phrygia; after which the Usurper is betrayed by his Chief Officers, and with them put to Death.</h2>

<p>Under the consulate  of Gratian and Dagala&iuml;fus in the following year, the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was begun. For as soon as the usurper Procopius, leaving Constantinople, began his march at the head of his army toward the emperor, Valens hastened from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and came to an engagement with him near a city of Phrygia, called Nacolia. In the first encounter he was defeated; but soon after he took Procopius alive, through the treachery of Agilo and Gomarius, two of his generals, whom he subjected to the most extraordinary punishments.  The traitors he caused to be executed by being sawn asunder, disregarding the oaths he had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> to them. Two trees standing near each other being forcibly bowed down, one of the usurper's legs was fastened to each of them, after which the trees being suddenly permitted to recover their erect position, by their rise rent the tyrant into two parts; and thus torn apart the usurper perished.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 6. After the Death of Procopius Valens constrains those who composed the Synod, and All Christians, to profess Arianism.</h2>

<p>The emperor having thus successfully terminated the conflict, immediately began to move against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, with the design of converting every <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> to <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. But he was especially incensed against those who had composed the Synod at Lampsacus, not only on account of their deposition of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but because they had <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> the creed published at Ariminum. On arriving therefore at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> in Bithynia, he sent for Eleusius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, who, as I have before said,  closely adhered to the opinions of Macedonius. Therefore the emperor having convened a council of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, commanded Eleusius to give his assent to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. At first he refused to do so, but on being terrified with threats of banishment and confiscation of property, he was intimidated and assented to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> belief. Immediately afterwards, however, he repented; and returning to <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, bitterly complained in presence of all the people, asserting that his quiescence was due to <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and not of his own choice. He then exhorted them to seek another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for themselves, since he had been compelled to renounce his own opinion. But the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a> loved and venerated him too much to think of losing him; they therefore refused to be subject to any other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, nor would they permit him to retire from his own church: and thus continuing under his oversight, they remained steadfast in their own <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Eunomius supersedes Eleusius the Macedonian in the See of Cyzicus, His Origin and Imitation of A&euml;tius, whose Amanuensis he had been.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople being informed of these circumstances, constituted Eunomius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, inasmuch as he was a person able by his eloquence to win over the minds of the multitude to his own way of thinking. On his arrival at <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a> an imperial edict was published in which it was ordered that Eleusius should be ejected, and Eunomius installed in his place. This being carried into effect, those who attached themselves to Eleusius, after erecting a sacred edifice without the city, assembled there with him. But enough has been said of Eleusius: let us now give some account of Eunomius. He had been secretary to A&euml;tius, surnamed Atheus, of whom we have before spoken,  and had learned from conversing with him, to imitate his sophistical mode of reasoning; being little aware that while exercising himself in framing fallacious arguments, and in the use of certain insignificant terms, he was really deceiving himself. This habit however inflated him with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and he fell into <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and so became an advocate of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and in various ways an adversary to the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And as he had but a very slender <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the letter of Scripture, he was wholly unable to enter into the spirit of it. Yet he abounded in words, and was accustomed to repeat the same thoughts in different terms, without ever arriving at a clear explanation of what he had proposed to himself. Of this his seven books <em>On the Apostle's Epistle to the Romans</em>, on which he bestowed a quantity of vain labor, is a remarkable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>: for although he has employed an immense number of words in the attempt to expound it, he has by no means succeeded in apprehending the scope and object of that epistle. All other works of his extant are of a similar character, in which he that would take the trouble to examine them, would find a great scarcity of sense, amidst a profusion of verbiage. This Eunomius Eudoxius promoted to the see of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>;  who having come there, astonished his auditors by the extraordinary display of his 'dialectic' art, and thus a great sensation was produced at <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>. At length the people unable to endure any longer the empty and assumptions parade of his language, drove him out of their city. He therefore withdrew to Constantinople, and taking up his abode with Eudoxius, was regarded as a titular  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But lest we should seem to have said these things for the sake of detraction, let us hear what Eunomius himself has the hardihood to utter in his sophistical discourses concerning the Deity himself, for he uses the following language: 'God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no more of his own substance than we do; nor is this more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him, and less to us: but whatever we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about the Divine substance, that precisely is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and on the other hand, whatever he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, the same also you will find without any difference in us.' This and many other similar tedious and absurd fallacies Eunomius was accustomed to draw up in utter insensibility to his own folly. On what account he afterwards separated from the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, we shall state in its proper place.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Of the Oracle found inscribed an a Stone, when the Walls of Chalcedon were demolished by Order of the Emperor Valens.</h2>

<p>An order was issued by the emperor that the walls of Chalcedon, a city opposite to Byzantium, should be demolished: for he had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> to do this, after he should have conquered the usurper, because the Chalcedonians had sided with the usurper, and had used insulting language toward Valens,  and shut their gates against him as he passed by their city. In consequence of the imperial decree, therefore, the walls were razed and the stones were conveyed to Constantinople to serve for the formation of the public baths which are called Constantian&aelig;.  On one of these stones an oracle was found engraven, which had lain concealed for a long time, in which it was predicted that when the city should be supplied with abundance of water, then should the wall serve for a bath; and that innumerable hordes of barbarous nations having overrun the provinces of the Roman empire, and done a great deal of mischief, should themselves at length be destroyed. We shall here insert this oracle for the gratification of the studious:  <br><br></p>

<blockquote><p>'When nymphs their mystic dance with wat'ry feet

<br>Shall tread through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> Byzantium's stately street;

<br>When rage the city wall shall overthrow,

<br>Whose stones to fence a bathing-place shall go:

<br>Then savage lands shall send forth myriad swarms,

<br>Adorned with golden locks aud burnished arms,

<br>That having Ister's silver streams o'erpast,

<br>Shall Scythian fields and M&oelig;sia's meadows waste.

<br>But when with conquest flushed they enter Thrace,

<br>Fate shall assign them there a burial-place.'
</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. And indeed it afterwards happened, that when Valens by building an aqueduct supplied Constantinople with abundance of water, the barbarous nations made various irruptions, as we shall hereafter see. But it happened that some explained the prediction otherwise. For when that aqueduct was completed, Clearchus the prefect of the city built a stately bath, to which the name of 'the Plentiful Water'  was given, in that which is now called the Forum of Theodosius: on which account the people celebrated a festival with great rejoicings, whereby there was, say they, an accomplishment of those words of the oracle,</p>

<blockquote><p>'their mystic dance with wat'ry feet
<br>Shall tread through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> Byzantium's stately street.'
</p></blockquote>

<p>But the completion of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> took place afterwards. While the demolition was in progress the Constantinopolitans besought the emperor to suspend the destruction of the walls; and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> and Nic&aelig;a sending from Bithynia to Constantinople, made the same request. But the emperor being exceedingly exasperated against the Chalcedonians, was with difficulty prevailed upon to listen to these petitions in their favor: but that he might perform his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, he commanded that the walls should be pulled down, while at the same time the breaches should be repaired by being filled up with other small stones. Whence it is that in the present day one may see in certain parts of the wall very inferior materials laid upon prodigiously large stones, forming those unsightly patches which were made on that occasion. So much will be sufficient on the walls of Chalcedon.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Valens persecutes the Novatians, because they accepted the Orthodox Faith.</h2>

<p>The emperor however did not cease his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of those who embraced the doctrine of the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em>, but drove them away from Constantinople: and as the Novatians acknowledged the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they also were subjected to similar treatment. He commanded that their churches should be shut up, also their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> they sent into exile. His name was Agelius, a person that had presided over their churches from the time of Constantine, and had led an apostolic life: for he always walked barefoot, and used but one coat, observing the injunction of the gospel. <span class="stiki" id="note260586"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;10:10</a></span> But the emperor's displeasure against this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was moderated by the efforts of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and eloquent man named Marcian, who had formerly been in military service at the imperial palace, but was at that time a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> church, and taught Anastasia and Carosa, the emperor's daughters, grammar; from the former of whom the public baths yet standing, which Valens erected at Constantinople, were named.  From respect for this person therefore the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> churches which had been for some time closed, were again opened. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> however would not suffer this people to remain undisturbed, for they disliked them on account of the sympathy and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Novatians manifested toward the Homoousians, with whom they agreed in sentiment. Such was the state of affairs at that time. We may here remark that the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the usurper Procopius was terminated about the end of May, in the consulate  of Gratian and Dagala&iuml;fus.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Birth of Valentinian the Younger.</h2>

<p>Soon after the conclusion of this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and under the same consulate,  a son was born to Valentinian, the emperor in the Western parts, to whom the same name as his father's was given. For Gratian had been born previously to his becoming emperor.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Hail of Extraordinary Size; and Earthquakes in Bithynia and the Hellespont.</h2>

<p>On the 2d of June of the following year, in the consulate  of Lupicin and Jovian, there fell at Constantinople hail of such a size as would fill a man's hand. Many affirmed that this hail had fallen as a consequence of the Divine displeasure, because of the emperor's having banished several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> engaged in the sacred ministry, those, that is to say, who refused to communicate with Eudoxius.  During the same consulate, on the 24th of August, the emperor Valentinian proclaimed his son Gratian Augustus. In the next year,  when Valentinian and Valens were a second time consuls, there happened on the 11th of October, an earthquake in Bithynia which destroyed the city of Nic&aelig;a on the eleventh day of October. This was about twelve years after <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> had been visited by a similar catastrophe. Soon afterwards the largest portion of Germa in the Hellespont was reduced to ruins by another earthquake. Nevertheless no impression was made on the mind of either Eudoxius the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or the emperor Valens, by these occurrences; for they did not desist from their relentless <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of those who dissented from them in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Meanwhile these convulsions of the earth were regarded as typical of the disturbances which agitated the churches: for many of the clerical body were sent into exile, as we have stated; Basil and Gregory alone, by a special dispensation of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, being on account of their eminent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> exempted from this punishment. The former of these individuals was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia; while Gregory presided over Nazianzus,  a little city in the vicinity of C&aelig;sarea. But we shall have occasion to mention both Basil and Gregory again in the course of our history.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 12. The Macedonians, pressed by the Emperor's Violence toward them, send a Deputation to Liberius Bishop of Rome, and subscribe the Nicene Creed.</h2>

<p>When the maintainers of the 'homoousian' doctrine had been thus severely dealt with, and put to flight, the persecutors began afresh to harass the Macedonians; who impelled by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, send deputations to one another from city to city, declaring the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of appealing to the emperor's brother, and also to Liberius <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>: and that it was far better for them to embrace their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, than to communicate with the party of Eudoxius. They sent for this purpose Eustathius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Sebastia, who had been several times deposed, Silvanus of Tarsus in Cilicia, and Theophilus of Castabala in the same province; charging them to dissent in nothing from Liberius concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but to enter into communion with the Roman church, and confirm the doctrine of the <em>homoousian.</em> These <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> therefore proceeded to Old Rome, carrying with them the letters of those who had separated themselves from Acacius at Seleucia. To the emperor they could not have access, he being occupied in the Gauls with a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the Sarmat&aelig;; but they presented their letters to Liberius. He at first refused to admit them; saying they were of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> faction, and could not possibly be received into communion by the church, inasmuch as they had rejected the Nicene Creed. To this they replied that by change of sentiment they had acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, having long since renounced the Anom&oelig;an  Creed, and avowed the Son to be in every way 'like the Father?': moreover that they considered the terms 'like' (<em>homoios</em>) and <em>homoousios</em> to have precisely the same import. When they had made this statement, Liberius demanded of them a written confession of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and they accordingly presented him a document in which the substance of the Nicene Creed was inserted. I have not introduced here, because of their length, the letters from Smyrna, Asia, and from Pisidia, Isauria, Pamphylia, and Lycia, in all which places they had held Synods. The written profession which the deputies sent with Eustathius, delivered to Liberius, is as follows:<br> <br></p>

<p>'To our Lord, Brother, and fellow-Minister Liberius: Eustathius, Theophilus, and Silvanus, salutations in the Lord.</p>

<p>'On account of the insane opinion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who cease not to introduce occasions of offense into the catholic churches, we being desirous of checking their career, come forward to express our approbation of the doctrines recognized the Synod of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> which has been convened at Lampsacus, Smyrna, and various other places: from which Synod we being constituted a deputation, bring a letter to your benignity and to all the Italian and Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, by which we declare that we hold and maintain the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was established in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council at Nic&aelig;a under the reign of Constantine of blessed memory, by three hundred and eighteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and has hitherto continued entire and unshaken; in which creed the term <em>homoousios</em> is holily and devoutly employed in opposition to the pernicious doctrine of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>. We therefore, together with the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom we represent, profess under our own hand, that we have held, do hold, and will maintain the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> even unto the end. We condemn <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and his impious doctrine, with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and those who agree with his sentiments; as also the same <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Sabellius,  the Patripassians,  the Marcionites,  the <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a>,  the Marcellians,  that of <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>,  and those who countenance such tenets; in short all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which are opposed to the aforesaid sacred creed, which was piously and in a catholic spirit set forth by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers at Nic&aelig;a. But we especially <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> that form of the creed which was recited at the Synod of Ariminum,  as altogether contrary to the before-mentioned creed of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod of Nic&aelig;a, to which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Constantinople affixed their signatures, being deceived by artifice and <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, by reason of its having been brought from Nice,  a town of Thrace. Our own creed, and that of those whose delegates we are, is this:<br> <br></p>

<p>'We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty, the Maker of all things visible and invisible: and in one only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; begotten of the Father; that is of the substance of the Father; God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Light of Light, very God of very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; begotten not made, of the same substance with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, through whom all things were made which are in heaven, and which are upon the earth: who for us men, and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, descended, became incarnate, and was made man; suffered, and rose again the third day; ascended into the heavens, and will come to judge the living and the dead. [We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>] also in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a> those who assert that 'there was a time when he was not,' and 'that he was not before he was begotten,' and that 'he was made of things which are not'; or those that say 'the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is of another hypostasis' or 'substance than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,' or that 'he is mutable, or susceptible of change.'</p>

<p>'<q>I, Eustathius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Sebastia, with Theophilus and Silvanus, delegates of the Synod of Lampsacus, Smyrna, and other places, have voluntarily subscribed this confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with our own hands. And if, after the publication of this creed, any one shall presume to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> either us, or those who sent us, let him come with the letters of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> before such <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> shall approve of, and bring the matter to an issue with us before them; and if any charge shall be substantiated, let the guilty be punished.</q>'</p>

<p>Liberius having securely pledged the delegates by this document, received them into communion, and afterwards dismissed them with this letter:</p>

<blockquote><p> <em>The Letter of Liberius Bishop of Rome, to the Bishops of the Macedonians.</em></p>

<p>To our beloved brethren and fellow-ministers, Evethius, Cyril, Hyperechius, Uranius, Heron, Elpidius, Maximus, Eusebius, Eucarpius, Heortasius, Neon, Eumathius, Faustinus, Proclinus, Pasinicus, Arsenius, Severus, Didymion, Brittanius, Callicrates, Dalmatius, &AElig;desius, Eustochius, Ambrose, Gelonius, Pardalius, Macedonius, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Marcellus, Heraclius, Alexander, Adolius, Marcian, Sthenelus, John, Macer, Charisius, Silvanus, Photinus, Anthony, Aythus, Celsus, Euphranon, Milesius, Patricius, Severian, Eusebius, Eumolpius, Athanasius, Diophantus, Menodorus, Diocles, Chrysampelus, Neon, Eugenius, Eustathius, Callicrates, Arsenius, Eugenius, Martyrius, Hieracius, Leontius, Philagrius, Lucius, and to all the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the East, Liberius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> throughout the West, salutations always in the Lord.</p>

<p>Your letters, beloved brethren, resplendent with the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, delivered to us by our highly esteemed brethren, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Eustathius, Silvanus, and Theophilus, brought to us the much longed-for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of peace and concord: and this chiefly because they have demonstrated and assured us that your opinion and sentiments are in perfect harmony with those both of our insignificance, and also with those of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the Western parts. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> this to be the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which until the time of the Synod at Nic&aelig;a had continued unadulterated and unshaken. This creed your legates have professed that they themselves hold, and to our great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> have obliterated every vestige and impression of an injurious suspicion, by attesting it not only in word, but also in writing. We have deemed it proper to subjoin to these letters a copy of this their declaration, lest we should leave any pretext to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> for entering into a fresh conspiracy, by which they might stir up the smouldering embers of their own <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and according to their custom, rekindle the flames of discord. Moreover our most esteemed brethren, Eustathius, Silvanus, and Theophilus, have professed this also, both that they themselves, and also your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, have always held, and will maintain unto the last, the creed approved of at Nic&aelig;a by 318 Orthodox Bishops; which contains the perfect <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and both confutes and overthrows the whole swarm of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For it was not of their own will, but by Divine appointment that so great a number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was collected against the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, as equaled that of those by whose assistance blessed <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> destroyed so many thousand of his enemies. <span class="stiki" id="note260604"><a href="../bible/gen014.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;14:14</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> being comprehended in the terms <em>hypostasis</em> and <em>homoousios</em>, like a strong and impregnable fortress checks and repels all the assaults and vain machinations of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> perverseness. Wherefore when all the Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were assembled at Ariminum, whither the craft of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> had drawn them, in order that either by deceptive persuasions, or to speak more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, by the coercion of the secular power, they might erase, or indirectly revoke what had been introduced into the creed with so much <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, their subtlety was not of the least avail. For almost all those who at Ariminum were either allured into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, or at that time deceived, have since taken a right view of the matter; and after <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> the exposition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> set forth by those who were convened at Ariminum, have subscribed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Creed which was promulgated at Nic&aelig;a. They have entered into communion with us, and regard the dogma of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with increased aversion, and are even indignant against it. Of which fact when the legates of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> saw the indubitable evidences, they annexed yourselves to their own subscription; <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and what was transacted at Ariminum against the creed ratified at Nic&aelig;a, to which even you yourselves, beguiled by <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, were induced to subscribe. Whence it appeared suitable to us to write to your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and to accede to your just request, especially since we are assured by the profession of your legates that the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have recovered their senses, and now concur in opinion with the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> of the West. We further give you to understand, lest ye should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it, that the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of the Synod of Ariminum have been <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> by those who seem to have been at that time deceived by fraud, and that all have acknowledged the Nicene Creed. It is fit therefore that it should be made generally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by you that such as have had their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> vitiated by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> or guile, may now emerge from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> darkness into the Divine light of catholic liberty. Moreover whosoever of them, after this council, shall not disgorge the poison of corrupt doctrine, by abjuring all the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> them, let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are themselves, together with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and the rest of the serpents, whether Sabellians, Patripassians, or the followers of any other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, dissevered and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> from the assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which does not admit of illegitimate children. May God preserve you steadfast, beloved brethren.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the adherents of Eustathius had received this letter, they proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, where they caused a Synod of Sicilian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to be convened, and in their presence avowed the homoousian <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and professed their adherence to the Nicene Creed: then having received from them also a letter to the same effect as the preceding, they returned to those who had sent them. They on their part, on the receipt of the letters of Liberius, sent delegates from city to city to the prominent supporters of the doctrine of the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em>, exhorting them to assemble simultaneously at Tarsus in Cilicia, in order to confirm the Nicene Creed, and terminate  all the contentions which had subsequently arisen. And indeed this would probably have been accomplished had not the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Eudoxius, who at that time possessed great influence with the emperor, thwarted their purpose; for on learning of the Synod that had been summoned to meet [at Tarsus], he became so exasperated that he redoubled his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against them. That the Macedonians by sending legates to Liberius were admitted to communion with him, and professed the Nicene Creed, is attested by Sabinus himself, in his <em>Collection of Synodical Transactions.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Eunomius separates from Eudoxius; a Disturbance is raised at Alexandria by Eudoxius, and Athanasius flees into Voluntary Exile again, but in Consequence of the Clamors of the People the Emperor recalls and re-establishes him in his See.</h2>

<p>About the same time Eunomius  separated himself from Eudoxius, and held assemblies apart, because after he had repeatedly entreated that his preceptor A&euml;tius might be received into communion, Eudoxius continued to oppose it. Now Eudoxius did this against his preference, for he did not reject the opinion with A&euml;tius since it was the same as his own;  but he yielded to the prevailing sentiment of his own party, who objected to A&euml;tius as heterodox. This was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the division between Eunomius and Eudoxius, and such was the state of things at Constantinople. But the church at Alexandria was disturbed by an edict of the pr&aelig;torian prefects, sent hither by means of Eudoxius. Whereupon Athanasius, dreading the irrational impetuosity of the multitude, and fearing lest he should be regarded as the author of the excesses that might be committed, concealed himself for four entire months in an ancestral tomb. Inasmuch however as the people, on account of their affection for him, became seditious in impatience of his absence, the emperor, on ascertaining that on this account agitation prevailed at Alexandria, ordered by his letters that Athanasius should be suffered to preside over the churches without molestation; and this was the reason why the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> church enjoyed tranquillity until the death of Athanasius. How the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> faction became possessed of the churches after his decease, we shall unfold in the course of our history. </p>

<h2>Chapter 14. The Ariansordain Demophilus after the Death of Eudoxius at Constantinople; but the Orthodox Party constitute Evagrius his Successor.</h2>

<p>The Emperor Valens leaving Constantinople again set out towards <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; but on his arrival at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, a city of Bithynia, his progress was arrested by the following circumstances. Eudoxius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> church who has been in possession of the seat of the Constantinopolitan church for nineteen  years, died soon after the emperor's departure from that city, in the third consulate  of Valentinian and Valens. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> therefore appointed Demophilus to succeed him; but the Homoousians considering that an opportunity was afforded them, elected a certain Evagrius, a person who maintained their own principles; and Eustathius, who had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, formally ordained him. He had been recalled from exile by Jovian, and had at this time privately come to Constantinople, for the purpose of confirming the adherents to the doctrine of the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 15. The Emperor banishes Evagrius and Eustathius. The Arianspersecute the Orthodox.</h2>

<p>When this had been accomplished the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> renewed their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the Homoousians: and the emperor was very soon informed of what had taken place, and apprehending the subversion of the city in consequence of some popular tumult, immediately sent troops from <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> to Constantinople; ordering that both he who had been ordained, and the one who had ordained him, should be apprehended and sent into exile in different regions. Eustathius therefore was banished to Bizya a city of Thrace; and Evagrius was conveyed to another place. After this the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, becoming bolder, grievously harassed the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> party, frequently beating them, reviling them, causing them to be imprisoned, and fined; in short they practiced distressing and intolerable annoyances against them. The sufferers were induced to appeal to the emperor for protection against their adversaries if haply they might obtain some relief from this oppression. But whatever hope of redress they might have cherished from this quarter, was altogether frustrated, inasmuch as they thus merely spread their grievances before him who was the very author of them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Certain Presbyters burnt in a Ship by Order of Valens. Famine in Phrygia.</h2>

<p>Certain <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men of the clerical order, eighty in number, among whom Urbanus, Theodore, and Menedemus were the leaders, proceeded to <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, and there presented to the emperor a supplicatory petition, informing him and complaining of the ill-usage to which they had been subjected. The emperor was filled with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; but dissembled his displeasure in their presence, and gave Modestus the prefect a secret order to apprehend these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and put them to death. The manner in which they were destroyed being unusual, deserves to be recorded. The prefect fearing that he should excite the populace to a seditious movement against himself, if he attempted the public execution of so many, pretended to send the men away into exile. Accordingly as they received the intelligence of their destiny with great firmness of mind the prefect ordered that they should be embarked as if to be conveyed to their several places of banishment, having meanwhile enjoined on the sailors to set the vessel on fire, as soon as they reached the mid sea, that their victims being so destroyed, might even be deprived of burial. This injunction was <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>; for when they arrived at the middle of the Astacian Gulf, the crew set fire to the ship, and then took refuge in a small barque which followed them, and so escaped. Meanwhile it came to pass that a strong easterly wind blew, and the burning ship was roughly driven but moved faster and was preserved until it reached a port named Dacidizus, where it was utterly consumed together with the men who were shut up in it. Many have asserted that this impious deed was not suffered to go unpunished: for there immediately after arose so great a famine throughout all Phrygia, that a large proportion of the inhabitants were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to abandon their country for a time, and betake themselves some to Constantinople and some to other provinces. For Constantinople, notwithstanding the vast population it supplies, yet always abounds with the necessaries of life, all manner of provisions being imported into it by sea from various regions; and the Euxine which lies near it, furnishes it with wheat to any extent it may require.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 17. The Emperor Valens, while at Antioch, again persecutes the Adherents of the 'Homoousion.'</h2>

<p>The Emperor Valens, little affected by the calamities resulting from the famine, went to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and during his residence there cruelly <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> such as would not embrace <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. For not content with ejecting out of almost all the churches of the East those who maintained the 'homoousian' opinion, he inflicted on them various punishments besides. He destroyed a greater number even than before, delivering them up to many different kinds of death, but especially drowning in the river.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Events at Edessa: Constancy of the Devout Citizens, and Courage of a Pious Woman.</h2>

<p>But we must here mention certain circumstances that occurred at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> in Mesopotamia. There is in that city a magnificent church  dedicated to St. Thomas the Apostle, wherein, on account of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the place, religious assemblies are incessantly held. The Emperor Valens wishing to inspect this edifice, and having learned that all who usually congregated there were opposed to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which he favored, he is said to have struck the prefect with his own hand, because he had neglected to expel them thence also. As the prefect after submitting to this ignominy, was most unwillingly constrained to subserve the emperor's indignation against them&mdash;for he did not desire to effect the slaughter of so great a number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>&mdash;he privately suggested that no one should be found there. But no one gave heed either to his admonitions or to his menaces; for on the following day they all crowded to the church.  And when the prefect was going towards it with a large military force in order to satisfy the emperor's rage, a poor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> leading her own little child by the hand hurried hastily by, on her way to the church, breaking through the ranks of the prefect's company of soldiers. The prefect irritated at this, ordered her to be brought to him, and thus addressed her: 'Wretched <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>! Whither are you running in so disorderly a manner?' She replied, 'To the same place that others are hastening.' 'Have you not heard,' said he, 'that the prefect is about to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> all that shall be found there?' 'Yes,' said the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, 'and therefore I hasten that I may be found there.' 'And whither are you dragging that little child?' said the prefect: the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> answered, 'That he also may be made worthy of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.'  The prefect on hearing these things, conjecturing that a similar resolution actuated the others who were assembled there, immediately went back to the emperor, and informed him that all were ready to die in behalf of their own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He added that it would be preposterous to destroy so many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> at one time, and thus persuaded the emperor to control his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. In this way were the <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessenes</a> preserved from being massacred by order of their sovereign.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Slaughter of Many Persons by Valens an Account of their Names, in Consequence of a Heathen Prediction </h2>

<p>The cruel disposition of the emperor was at this time abused by an execrable <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, who induced certain curious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to institute an inquiry by means of necromancy as to who should succeed Valens on the throne. To their magical incantations the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> gave responses not distinct and unequivocal, but as the general practice is, full of ambiguity; for displaying the four letters <span class="greek">q, e, o, and d</span>, he declared that the name of the successor of Valens began with these; and that it was a compound name. When the emperor was apprised of this oracle, instead of committing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who alone can penetrate futurity, the decision of this matter, in contravention of those <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> principles to which he pretended the most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> adherence, he <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> very many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of whom he had the suspicion that they aimed at the sovereign power: thus such as were named 'Theodore,' 'Theodotus,' 'Theodosius,' 'Theodulus,' and the like, were <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to the emperor's fears; and among the rest was Theodosiolus, a very brave man, descended from a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> therefore, to avoid the danger to which they were exposed, changed their names, giving up those which they had received from their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in infancy as dangerous. This will be enough on that subject.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Death of Athanasius, and Elevation of Peter to His See </h2>

<p>It must be said that as long as Athanasius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, was alive, the emperor, restrained by the Providence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, abstained from molesting Alexandria and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: indeed he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> very well that the multitude of those who were attached to Athanasius was very great; and on that account he was careful lest the public affairs should be hazarded, by the Alexandrians, who are an irritable race, being excited to sedition. But Athanasius, after being engaged in so many and such severe conflicts on behalf of the church, departed this life in the second consulate  of Gratian and Probus, having governed that church amidst the greatest perils forty-six years. He left as his successor Peter, a devout and eloquent man.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 21. The Ariansare allowed by the Emperor to imprison Peter and to set Lucius over the See of Alexandria.</h2>

<p>Upon this the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, emboldened by their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the emperor's religious sentiments, again took <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and without delay informed him of the circumstance. He was then residing at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. Then indeed Euzo&iuml;us who presided over the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> of that city, eagerly embracing the favorable opportunity thus presented, begged permission to go to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, for the purpose of putting Lucius the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> in possession of the churches there. The emperor acceded to this request, and as speedily as possible Euzo&iuml;us proceeded immediately to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, attended by the imperial troops. Magnus, also, the emperor's treasurer, went with him. Moreover an imperial mandate had been issued to Palladius, the governor of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, enjoining him to aid them with a military force. Wherefore having apprehended Peter, they cast him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; and after dispersing the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, they placed Lucius in the episcopal chair.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Silence of Sabinus on the Misdeeds of the Arians; Flight of Peter to Rome; Massacre of the Solitaries at the Instigation of the Arians.</h2>

<p>Of the outrages perpetrated upon the installation of Lucius, and the treatment of those who were ejected, both in the courts and outside of the courts, and how some were subjected to a variety of tortures, and others sent into exile even after this excruciating process, Sabinus takes not the slightest notice. In fact, being half disposed to <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> himself, he purposely veils the atrocities of his friends. Peter, however, has exposed them, in the letters he addressed to all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, when he had escaped from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. For this [<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>] having managed to escape from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, fled to Damasus, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> though not very numerous, becoming thus possessed of the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> churches soon after obtained an imperial edict directing the governor of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to expel not only from <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> but even out of the country, the favorers of the 'homoousian' doctrine, and all such as were obnoxious to Lucius. After this they assailed and disturbed and terribly harassed the monastic institutions in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>; armed men rushed in the most ferocious manner upon those who were utterly defenceless, and who would not lift an arm to repel their <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>: so that numbers of unresisting victims were in this manner slaughtered with a degree of wanton cruelty beyond description.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. The Deeds of Some Holy Persons who devoted themselves to a Solitary Life </h2>

<p>Since I have referred to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, it may be proper here to give a brief account of them. They were founded probably at a very early period, but were greatly enlarged and augmented by a devout man whose name was Ammoun. In his youth this person had an aversion to matrimony; but when some of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> urged him not to contemn marriage, but to take a wife to himself, he was prevailed upon and was married. On leading the bride with the customary ceremonies from the banquet-room to the nuptial couch, after their mutual friends had withdrawn, he took a book  containing the epistles of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and read to his wife <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> Epistle to the Corinthians, explaining to her the apostle's admonitions to married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.  Adducing many external considerations besides, he descanted on the inconveniences and discomforts attending matrimonial intercourse, the pangs of child-bearing, and the trouble and anxiety connected with rearing a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. He contrasted with all this the advantages of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; described the liberty, and immaculate purity of a life of continence; and affirmed that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> places <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the nearest relation to the Deity. By these and other arguments of a similar kind, he persuaded his virgin bride to renounce with him a secular life, prior to their having any conjugal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of each other. Having taken this resolution, they retired together to the mountain of Nitria, and in a hut there inhabited for a short time one common <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> apartment, without regarding their difference of sex, being according to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, 'one in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.'  But not long after, the recent and unpolluted bride thus addressed Ammoun: 'It is unsuitable,' said she, 'for you who practice <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, to look upon a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in so confined a dwelling; let us therefore, if it is agreeable to you, perform our exercise apart.' This agreement again was satisfactory to both, and so they separated, and spent the rest of their lives in abstinence from wine and oil, eating dry bread alone, sometimes passing over one day, at others <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> two, and sometimes more. Athanasius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, asserts in his <em>Life of Anthony</em>,  that the subject of his memoir who was contemporary with this Ammoun, saw his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> taken up by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> after his decease. Accordingly, a great number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> emulated Ammoun's manner of life, so that by degrees the mountains of Nitria and Scitis were filled with <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, an account of whose lives would require an express work. As, however, there were among them <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of eminent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, distinguished for their strict discipline and apostolic lives, who said and did many things worthy of being recorded, I deem it useful to interweave with my history a few particulars selected out of the great number for the information of my readers. It is said that Ammoun never saw himself naked, being accustomed to say that 'it became not a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> to see even his own person exposed.' And when once he wanted to pass a river, but was unwilling to undress, he besought God to enable him to cross without his being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to break his resolution; and immediately an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> transported him to the other side of the river. Another <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> named Didymus  lived entirely alone to the day of his death, although he had reached the age of ninety years. Arsenius, another of them, would not separate young delinquents from communion, but only those that were advanced in age: 'for,' said he, 'when a young person is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> he becomes hardened; but an elderly one is soon sensible of the misery of excommunication.' Pior was accustomed to take his food as he walked along. As a certain one asked him, 'Why do you eat thus?' 'That I may not seem,' said he, 'to make eating serious business but rather a thing done by the way.' To another putting the same question he replied, 'Lest even in eating my mind should be sensible of corporeal enjoyment.' Isidore affirmed that he had not been conscious of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> even in thought for forty years; and that he had never consented either to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Pambos being an illiterate man went to some one for the purpose of being taught a psalm; and having heard the first verse of the thirty-eighth psalm, 'I said I will take heed to my ways, that I offend not with my tongue,'  he departed without staying to hear the second verse, saying, 'this one will suffice, if I can practically acquire it.' And when the person who had given him the verse reproved him because he had not seen him for the space of six months, he answered that he had not yet learned to practice the verse of the psalm. After a considerable lapse of time, being asked by one of his friends whether he had made himself master of the verse, his answer was, 'I have scarcely succeeded in accomplishing it during nineteen years.' A certain individual having placed gold in his hands for distribution to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, requested him to reckon what he had given him. 'There is no need of counting,' said he, 'but of integrity of mind.' This same Pambos, at the desire of Athanasius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, came out of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> and on beholding an actress there, he wept. When those present asked him why he wept, he replied, 'Two causes have affected me: one is the destruction of this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; the other is that I exert myself less to please my God than she does to please obscene characters.' Another said that 'a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who did not work ought to be regarded as on a level with the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man.' Piterus was well-informed in many branches of natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and was accustomed frequently to enter into expositions of the principles sometimes of one and sometimes of another department of science, but he always commenced his expositions with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. There were also among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of that period, two of the same name, of great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, each being called Macarius; one of whom was from Upper <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the other from the city of Alexandria. Both were celebrated for their <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> discipline, the purity of their life and conversation, and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which were wrought by their hands. The <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Macarius performed so many cures, and cast out so many devils, that it would require a distinct treatise to record all that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God enabled him to do. His manner toward those who resorted to him was austere, yet at the same time calculated to inspire veneration. The <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> Macarius, while in all respects resembling his <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> namesake, differed from him in this, that he was always cheerful to his visitors; and by the affability of his manners led many young men to <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>. Evagrius  became a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of these men, acquired from them the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, whereas he had previously <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that which consisted in words only. He was ordained <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at Constantinople by Gregory of Nazianzus, and afterwards went with him into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where he became acquainted with these eminent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and emulated their course of conduct, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were done by his hands as numerous and important as those of his preceptors. Books were also composed by him of very valuable nature, one of which is entitled <em>The Monk</em>, or, <em>On Active Virtue;</em> another <em>The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a></em>,  or, <em>To him who is deemed worthy of Knowledge:</em> this book is divided into fifty chapters. A third is designated <em>Antirrheticus</em>, and contains selections from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> against tempting spirits, distributed into eight parts, according to the number of the arguments. He wrote moreover <em>Six Hundred Prognostic Problems</em>, and also two compositions in verse, one addressed <em>To the Monks living in Communities</em>, and the other <em>To the Virgin.</em> Whoever shall read these productions will be convinced of their excellence. It will not be out of place here, I conceive, to subjoin to what has been before stated, a few things mentioned by him respecting the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. These are his words:  <br><br></p>

<p>It becomes us to enquire into the habits of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who have preceded us, in order that we may correct ourselves by their example: for undoubtedly very many excellent things have been said and done by them. One of them was accustomed to say, that 'a drier and not irregular diet combined with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, would quickly conduct a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> into the haven of tranquillity.' The same individual freed one of his brethren from being troubled by apparitions at night, by enjoining him to minister while <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> to the sick. And being asked why he prescribed this: 'Such affections,' said he, 'are by nothing so effectually dissipated as by the exercise of compassion.' A certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> of those times coming to Anthony the Just, said to him, 'How can you endure, father, being deprived of the comfort of books?' 'My book, O <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>,' replied Anthony, 'is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things that are made, and it is present whenever I wish to read the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.' That 'chosen vessel,' <span class="stiki" id="note260627"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;9:15</a></span> the aged <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Macarius, asked me, why the strength of the faculty of memory is impaired by cherishing the remembrance of injury received from men; while by remembering those done us by devils it remains uninjured? And when I hesitated, scarcely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what answer to make, and begged him to account for it: 'Because,' said he, 'the former is an affection contrary to nature, and the latter is conformable to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the mind.' Going on one occasion to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> father Macarius about mid-day, and being overcome with the heat and thirst, I begged for some water to drink: 'Content yourself with the shade,' was his reply, 'for many who are now journeying by land, or sailing on the deep, are deprived even of this.' Discussing with him afterwards the subject of abstinence, 'Take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, my son,' said he: 'for twenty years I have neither eaten, drunk, nor slept to satiety; my bread has always been weighed, my water measured, and what little sleep I have had has been stolen by reclining myself against a wall.' <span class="stiki" id="note260628"><a href="../bible/ezr004.htm#verse10">Ezra&nbsp;4:10-11</a></span> The death of his father was announced to one of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>: 'Cease your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>,' said he to the person that told him; 'my father is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.' One of the brethren who possessed nothing but a copy of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, sold it, and distributed the price in food to the hungry, uttering this memorable saying&mdash; 'I have sold the book which says, <q>Sell that you have and give to the poor.</q>' <span class="stiki" id="note260629"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21</a></span> There is an island about the northern part of the city of Alexandria, beyond the lake called Maria, where a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> from Parembole  dwells, in high repute among the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>. This person was accustomed to say, that all the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were done for one of these five reasons;&mdash; on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nature, custom, necessity, or manual labor. The same also said that there was only one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in nature, but that it assumes various characteristics according to the dispositions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: just as the light of the sun is itself without <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but accommodates itself to the figure of that which receives it. Another of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> said, 'I withdraw myself from pleasures, in order to cut off the occasions of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it always contends for pleasures, disturbing my tranquillity of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and unfitting me for the attainment of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.' One of the aged <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> said that 'Love <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not how to keep a deposit either of provisions or money.' He added, 'I never remember to have been twice deceived by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in the same thing.' Thus wrote Evagrius in his book entitled <em>Practice</em>.  And in that which he called <em>The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a></em> he says, 'We have learned from Gregory the Just, that there are four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, having distinct characteristics:&mdash; <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. That it is the province of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to contemplate the sacred and intelligent powers apart from expression, because these are unfolded by wisdom: of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to adhere to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> against all opposition, and never to turn aside to that which is unreal: of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to receive seed from the chief husbandman, <span class="stiki" id="note260632"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;13:24</a></span> but to repel him who would sow over it seed of another kind: and finally, of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to adapt discourse to every one, according to their condition and capacity; stating some things obscurely, others in a figurative manner, and explaining others clearly for the instruction of the less intelligent.' That pillar of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Basil of Cappadocia, used to say that 'the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which men teach is perfected by constant study and exercise; but that which proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the practice of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, patience, and mercy.' That the former indeed is often developed in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are still subject to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; whereas the latter is the portion of those only who are superior to their influence, and who during the season of devotion, contemplate that peculiar light of the mind which illumines them. That luminary of the Egyptians, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Athanasius, assures us 'that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was commanded to place the table on the north <span class="stiki" id="note260633"><a href="../bible/exo026.htm#verse35">Exodus&nbsp;26:35</a></span> side. Let the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> therefore understand what wind is contrary to them, and so nobly endure every <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, and minister nourishment with a willing mind to those who apply to them.' Serapion, the <a href="../cathen/01486a.htm">angel of the church</a> of the Thmu&iuml;tae, declared that 'the mind is completely purified by drinking in spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>': that 'charity cures the inflammatory tendencies of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>'; and that 'the depraved <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> which spring up in it are restrained by abstinence.' 'Exercise yourself continually,' said the great and enlightened teacher Didymus, 'in reflecting on <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and judgment; and endeavor to bear in memory the material of whatever discourses you may have heard on these topics, for almost all fail in this respect. You will find reasonings concerning judgment in the difference of created forms, and the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>: sermons on <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> comprehended in those means by which we are led from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.'<br> <br></p>

<p>These few extracts from Evagrius we thought it would be appropriate to insert here. There was another excellent man among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, named Ammonius, who had so little interest in secular matters, that when he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with Athanasius, he chose to investigate none of the magnificent works of that city, contenting himself with examining the Cathedral of Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> only. This same Ammonius on being urged to enter upon the episcopal office, cut off his own right ear, that by mutilation of his person he might disqualify himself for ordination. But when long afterwards Evagrius, whom Theophilus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, wished to make a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, having effected his escape without maiming himself in any way, afterwards happened to meet Ammonius, and told him jocosely, that he had done wrong in cutting off his own ear, as he had by that means rendered himself criminal in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To which Ammonius replied, 'And do you think, Evagrius, that you will not be punished, who from self-<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> have cut out your own tongue, to avoid the exercise of that gift of utterance which has been committed to you?' There were at the same time in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> very many other admirable and devout characters whom it would be too tedious to enumerate in this place, and besides if we should attempt to describe the life of each, and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> they did by means of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> with which they were endowed, we should necessarily digress too far from the object we have in view. Should any one desire to become acquainted with their history, in reference both to their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and experiences and discourses for the edification of their auditors, as well as how wild beasts became subject to their authority, there is a specific treatise  as on the subject, composed by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Palladius, who was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Evagrius, and gives all these particulars in minute detail. In that work he also mentions several <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who practiced the same kind of austerities as the men that have been referred to. Both Evagrius and Palladius flourished a short time after the death of Valens. We must now return to the point whence we diverged.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Assault upon the Monks, and Banishment of their Superiors, who exhibit Miraculous Power.</h2>

<p>The emperor Valens having issued an edict commanding that the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> should be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> both in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> and in the rest of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, depopulation and ruin to an immense extent immediately followed: some were dragged before the tribunals, others cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and many tortured in various ways, and in fact all sorts of punishments were inflicted upon <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who aimed only at peace and quiet. When these outrages had been perpetrated at Alexandria just as Lucius thought proper, Euzo&iuml;us returned to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and Lucian the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, attended by the commander-in-chief of the army with a considerable body of troops, immediately proceeded to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where the general in person assailed the assemblage of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men with greater fury even than the ruthless soldiery. On reaching these solitudes they found the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> engaged in their customary exercises, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, healing diseases, and casting out devils. Yet they, regardless of these extraordinary evidences of Divine power, suffered them not to continue their solemn devotions, but drove them out of the <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> by force. Rufinus declares that he was not only a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of these cruelties, but also one of the sufferers. Thus in them were renewed those things which are spoken of by the apostle: <span class="stiki" id="note260635"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse36">Hebrews&nbsp;11:36-38</a></span> 'for they were mocked, and had trial of scourgings, were stripped naked, put in bonds, <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, slain with the sword, went about in the wilderness clad in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy, wandering in deserts, in mountains, in dens and caves of the earth.' In all these things 'they obtained a good report' for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and their works, and the cures which the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ wrought by their hands. But as it appears <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> permitted them to endure these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, 'having for them provided something better,' <span class="stiki" id="note260636"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse40">Hebrews&nbsp;11:40</a></span> that through their sufferings others might obtain the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this subsequent events seem to prove. When therefore these wonderful men <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> superior to all the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> which was exercised toward them, Lucius in despair advised the military chief to send the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> into exile: these were the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Macarius, and his namesake of Alexandria, both of whom were accordingly banished to an island where there was no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> inhabitant, and in this island there was an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> temple, and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whom the inhabitants worshipped as a god. On the arrival of these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men at the island, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> of that place were filled with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trepidation. Now it happened at the same time that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> daughter became suddenly possessed by a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, and began to act with great fury, and to overturn everything that came in her way; nor was any force sufficient to restrain her, but she cried with a loud voice to these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying:&mdash; 'Why are you come here to cast us out from hence also?' <span class="stiki" id="note260637"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;8:29</a></span> Then did the men there also display the peculiar power which they had received through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>: for having cast out the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> from the maid, and presented her cured to her father, they led the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> himself, and also all the inhabitants of the island to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Whereupon they immediately broke their images in pieces, and changed the form of their temple into that of a church; and having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, they joyfully received instruction in the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Thus these marvelous individuals, after enduring <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> on account of the 'homoousian' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, were themselves more approved, became the means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to others, and confirmed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 25. Of Didymus the Blind Man </h2>

<p>About the same period God brought into observation another faithful person, deeming it worthy that through him <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might be witnessed unto: this was Didymus, a most admirable and eloquent man, instructed in all the learning of the age in which he flourished. At a very early age, when he had scarcely acquired the first elements of learning, he was attacked by disease in the eyes which deprived him of sight. But God compensated to him the loss of corporeal vision, by bestowing increased intellectual acumen. For what he could not learn by seeing, he was enabled to acquire through the sense of hearing; so that being from his childhood endowed with excellent abilities, he soon far surpassed his youthful companions who possessed the keenest sight. He made himself master of the principles of grammar and rhetoric with astonishing facility; and proceeded thence to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies, dialectics, arithmetic, music, and the various other departments of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to which his attention was directed; and he so treasured up in his mind these branches of science, that he was prepared with the utmost readiness to enter into a discussion of these subjects with those who had become conversant therewith by reading books. Not only this, but he was so well acquainted with the Divine oracles contained in the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> that he composed several treatises in exposition of them, besides three books on the <em>Trinity.</em> He published also commentaries  on <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> book <em>Of Principles</em>, in which he commends these writings, saying that they are excellent, and that those who <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> their author, and speak slightingly of his works, are mere cavilers. 'For,' says he, 'they are destitute of sufficient penetration to comprehend the profound wisdom of that extraordinary man.' Those who may desire to form a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> idea of the extensive erudition of Didymus, and the intense ardor of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, must peruse with attention his diversified and elaborate works. It is said that after Anthony had conversed for some time with this Didymus, long before the reign of Valens, when he came from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, perceiving the learning and intelligence of the man, he said to him, 'Didymus, let not the loss of your bodily eyes distress you: for you are deprived of such eyes merely as are the common possession of gnats and flies; rather <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that you have eyes such as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> see with, by which the Deity himself is discerned, and his light comprehended.' This address of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Anthony to Didymus was made long before the times we are describing: in fact Didymus was then regarded as the great bulwark of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, answering the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, whose sophistic cavilings he fully exposed, triumphantly refuting all their vain subtleties and deceptive reasonings.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Of Basil of C&aelig;sarea, and Gregory of Nazianzus </h2>

<p>Now Providence opposed Didymus to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> at Alexandria. But for the purpose of confuting them in other cities, it raised up Basil of C&aelig;sarea and Gregory of Nazianzus; concerning these it will be reasonable to give a brief account in this place. Indeed the universally prevalent memory of the men would be enough as a token of their fame; and the extent of their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is sufficiently perceptible in their writings. Since, however, the exercise of their talents was of great service to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, tending in a high degree to the maintenance of the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of my history obliges me to take particular notice of these two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. If any one should compare Basil and Gregory with one another, and consider the life, morals, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of each, he would find it difficult to decide to which of them he ought to assign the pre-eminence: so equally did they both appear to excel, whether you regard the rectitude of their conduct, or their deep acquaintance with Greek literature and the sacred Scriptures. In their youth they were pupils at Athens of Himerius  and Proh&aelig;resius,  the most celebrated sophists of that age: subsequently they frequented the school of Libanius  at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, where they cultivated rhetoric to the utmost. Having been deemed worthy of the profession of sophistry, they were urged by many of their friends to enter the profession of teaching eloquence; others would have persuaded them to practice law: but despising both these pursuits, they abandoned their former studies, and embraced the monastic life. Having had some slight taste of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> science from him who then taught it at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, they procured <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> works, and drew from them the right interpretation of the sacred Scriptures; for the fame of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was very great and widespread throughout the whole world at that time; after a careful perusal of the writings of that great man, they contended against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> with manifest advantage. And when the defenders of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> quoted the same author in confirmation, as they imagined, of their own views, these two confuted them, and clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that their opponents did not at all understand the reasoning of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. Indeed, although Eunomius,  who was then their champion, and many others on the side of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> were considered men of great eloquence, yet whenever they attempted to enter into controversy with Gregory and Basil, they appeared in comparison with them <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and illiterate. Basil being ordained to the office of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, was by Meletius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, from that rank elevated to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia, which was his native country. Thither he therefore hastened, fearing lest these <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> should have infected the provinces of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>; and in order to counteract them, he founded several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, diligently instructed the people in his own doctrines, and confirmed the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those whose minds were wavering. Gregory being constituted <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nazianzus,  a small city of Cappadocia over which his own father had before presided, pursued a course similar to that which Basil took; for he went through the various cities, and strengthened the weak in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. To Constantinople in particular he made frequent visits, and by his ministrations there, comforted and assured the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, wherefore a short time after, by the suffrage of many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church at Constantinople. When intelligence of the proceedings of these two <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and devoted men reached the ears of the emperor Valens, he immediately ordered Basil to be brought from C&aelig;sarea to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>;  where being arraigned before the tribunal of the prefect, that functionary asked him 'why he would not embrace the emperor's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>?' Basil with much boldness condemned the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of that creed which his sovereign countenanced, and vindicated the doctrine of the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a>:</em> and when the prefect threatened him with death, 'Would,' said Basil, 'that I might be released from the bonds of the body for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> sake.' The prefect having exhorted him to reconsider the matter more seriously, Basil is reported to have said, 'I am the same today that I shall be tomorrow: but I wish that you had not changed yourself.' At that time, therefore, Basil remained in custody throughout the day. It happened, however, not long afterwards that Galates, the emperor's infant son, was attacked with a dangerous malady, so that the physicians despaired of his recovery; when the empress Dominica, his mother, assured the emperor that she had been greatly disquieted in her dreams by fearful visions, which led her to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the child's illness was a chastisement on account of the ill treatment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The emperor after a little reflection sent for Basil, and in order to prove his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> said to him, 'If the doctrine you maintain is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that my son may not die.' 'If your majesty should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> as I do,' replied Basil, 'and the church should be unified, the child shall live.' To these conditions the emperor would not agree: '<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> concerning the child will be done then,' said Basil; as Basil said this the emperor ordered him to be dismissed; the child, however, died shortly after. Such is an epitome of the history of these distinguished ecclesiastics, both of whom have left us many admirable works, some of which Rufinus says he has translated into Latin. Basil had two brothers, Peter and Gregory; the former of whom adopted Basil's monastic mode of life; while the latter emulated his eloquence in teaching, and completed after his death Basil's treatise on the <em>Six Days' Work</em>, which had been left unfinished. He also pronounced at Constantinople the funeral oration of Meletius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; and many other orations of his are still extant.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 27. Of Gregory Thaumaturgus (the Wonder-Worker).</h2>

<p>But since from the likeness of the name, and the title of the books attributed to Gregory, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are liable to confound very different parties, it is important to notice that Gregory of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> is a different person. He was a native of Neoc&aelig;sarea in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, of greater antiquity than the one above referred to, inasmuch as he was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>.  This Gregory's fame was celebrated at Athens, at Berytus, throughout the entire diocese of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and I might almost add in the whole world. When he had finished his education in the schools of Athens, he went to Berytus to study civil law, where hearing that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> expounded the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> at C&aelig;sarea, he quickly proceeded there; and after his understanding had been opened to perceive the grandeur of these Divine books, bidding adieu to all further cultivation of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, he became thenceforth inseparable from <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, from whom having acquired a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, he was recalled soon after by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and returned to his own country; and there, while still a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, he performed many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, healing the sick, and casting out devils even by his letters, insomuch that the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> were no less attracted to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by his acts, than by his discourses. Pamphilus Martyr mentions this person in the books which he wrote in defence of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>; to which there is added a commendatory oration of Gregory's, composed in praise of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, when he was under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of leaving him. There were then, to be brief, several Gregories: the first and most ancient was the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>; the second was the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nazianzus; the third was Basil's brother; and there was another Gregory  whom the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> constituted <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> during the exile of Athanasius. But enough has been said respecting them.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 28. Of Novatus and his Followers. The Novatians of Phrygia alter the Time of keeping Easter, following Jewish Usage.</h2>

<p>About this time the Novatians  inhabiting Phrygia changed the day for celebrating the Feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. How this happened I shall state, after first explaining the reason of the strict discipline which is maintained in their church, even to the present day, in the provinces of Phrygia and Paphlagonia. Novatus,  a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the Roman Church, separated from it, because Cornelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> received into communion <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> who had <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Emperor Decius</a>  had raised against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Having seceded on this account, on being afterwards elevated to the episcopacy by such <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as entertained similar sentiments, he wrote to all the churches  that 'they should not admit to the sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> those who had <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>; but exhorting them to repentance, leave the pardoning of their offense to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has the power to forgive all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.' Receiving such letters, the parties in the various provinces, to whom they were addressed, acted according to their several dispositions and judgments. As he asked that they should not receive to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> those who after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> had committed any deadly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <span class="stiki" id="note260653"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:16-17</a></span> this appeared to some a cruel and merciless course: but others received the rule as just and conducive to the maintenance of discipline, and the promotion of greater devotedness of life. In the midst of the agitation of this question, letters arrived from Cornelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, promising indulgence to delinquents after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Thus as these two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> wrote contrary to one another, and each confirmed his own procedure by the testimony of the Divine word, as it usually happens, every one identified himself with that view which favored his previous habits and inclinations. Those who had pleasure in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, encouraged by the license then granted them, took occasion from it to revel in every species of criminality. Now the Phrygians appear to be more temperate than other nations, and are seldom guilty of swearing. The Scythians, on the other hand, and the Thracians, are naturally of a very irritable disposition: while the inhabitants of the East are addicted to sensual pleasures. But the Paphlagonians and Phrygians are prone to neither of these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>; nor are the sports of the circus and theatrical exhibitions in much estimation among them even to the present day. And for this reason, it seems to me, these people, as well as others of the same character, so readily assented to the letters then written by Novatus. Fornication and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> are regarded among them as the grossest enormities: and it is well known that there is no race of men on the face of the earth who more rigidly govern their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in this respect than the Phrygians and Paphlagonians. The same reason I think had force with those who dwelt in the West and followed Novatus. Yet although for the sake of stricter discipline Novatus became a separatist, he made no change in the time of keeping <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>,  but invariably observed the practice that obtained in the Western churches. For they celebrate this feast after the equinox, according to the usage which had of old been delivered to them when first they embraced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. He himself indeed afterwards suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in the reign of Valerian,  during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which was then raised against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. But those in Phrygia  who are named after him Novatians, about this period changed the day of celebrating <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, being averse to communion with other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> even on this occasion. This was effected by means of a few obscure <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of that <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> convening a Synod at the village of Pazum, which is situated near the sources of the river Sangarius; for there they framed a canon appointing its observance on the same day as that on which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> annually keep the feast of Unleavened Bread. An aged man, who was the son of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and had been present with his father at this Synod, gave us our information on this matter. But both Agelius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Novatians at Constantinople, and Maximus of Nic&aelig;a, as also the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> and Coty&aelig;um, were absent, although the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs of the Novatians were for the most part under the control of these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. How the church of the Novatians soon after was divided into two parties in consequence of this Synod, shall be related in its proper course:  but we must now notice what took place about the same time in the Western parts.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 29. Damasus ordained Bishop of Rome. Sedition and Loss of Life caused by the Rivalry of Ursinus.</h2>

<p>While the emperor Valentinian governed in peace, and interfered with no <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, Damasus after Liberius undertook the administration of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>;  whereupon a great disturbance was caused on the following account.  A certain Ursinus, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of that church, had been nominated among others when the election of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> took place; as Damasus  was preferred, this Ursinus, unable to bear the disappointment of his hopes, held schismatic assemblies apart from the church, and even induced certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of little distinction to ordain him in secret. This ordination was made, not in a church,  but in a retired place called the Palace of Sicine, whereupon dissension arose among the people; their disagreement being not about any article of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but simply as to who should be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Hence frequent conflicts arose, insomuch that many lives were <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> in this contention; and many of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were punished on that account by Maximin, the prefect of the city. Thus was Ursinus <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to desist from his pretensions at that time, and those who were minded to follow him were reduced to order.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 30. Dissension about a Successor to Auxentius, Bishop of Milan. Ambrose, Governor of the Province, going to appease the Tumult, is by General Consent and with the Approval of the Emperor Valentinian elected to the Bishopric of that Church.</h2>

<p>About the same time it happened that  another event took place at Milan well worthy of being recorded. On the death of Auxentius, who had been ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that church by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, the people again were disturbed respecting the election of a successor; for as some proposed one person, and others favored another, the city was full of contention and uproar. In this state of things the governor of the province, Ambrose by name,  who was also of consular dignity, dreading some catastrophe from the popular excitement, ran into the church in order to quell the disturbance. As he arrived there and the people became quiet, he repressed the irrational fury of the multitude by a long and appropriate address, by urging such motives as they felt to be right, and all present suddenly came to an unanimous agreement, crying out 'that Ambrose was worthy of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>,' and demanding his ordination: 'for by that means only,' it was alleged, 'would the peace of the church be secured, and all be reunited in the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and judgment.' And inasmuch as such unanimity among the people appeared to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> then present to proceed from some Divine appointment, immediately they laid hands on Ambrose; and having <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> him&mdash; for he was then but a catechumen&mdash; they were about to invest him with the episcopal office. But although Ambrose willingly received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he with great earnestness refused to be ordained: upon which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> referred the matter to the Emperor Valentinian. This prince regarding the universal consent of the people as the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sent word to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by ordaining him; declaring that 'his choice was by the voice of God rather than by the votes of men.' Ambrose was therefore ordained; and thus the inhabitants of Milan who were divided among themselves, were once more restored to unity.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 31. Death of Valentinian.</h2>

<p>The Sarmat&aelig; after this having made incursions into the Roman territories, the emperor marched against them with a numerous army but when the barbarians understood the formidable nature of this expedition, they sent an embassy to him to sue for peace on certain conditions. As the ambassadors were introduced to the emperor's presence, and appeared to him to be not very dignified fellows, he enquired whether all the Sarmat&aelig; were such as these? As they replied that the noblest personages of their whole nation had come to him, Valentinian became excessively enraged, and exclaimed with great vehemence, that 'the Roman empire was indeed most wretched in devolving upon him at a time when a nation of such despicable barbarians, not content with being permitted to exist in safety within their own limits, dared to take up arms, invade the Roman territories, and break forth into open <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.' The <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of his manner and utterance of these words was so great, that all his veins were opened by the effort, and all the arteries ruptured; and from the quantity of blood which thereupon gushed forth he died. This occurred at Bergition Castle, after Gratian's third consulate  in conjunction with Equitius, on the seventeenth day of November, Valentinian having lived fifty-four years and reigned thirteen. Upon the decease of Valentinian, six days after his death the army in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> proclaimed his son Valentinian, then a young child, emperor, at Acincum, a city of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.  When this was announced to the other two emperors, they were displeased, not because the brother of the one and the nephew of the other had been declared emperor, but because the military presumed to proclaim him without consulting them, whom they themselves wished to have proclaimed. They both, however, ratified the transaction, and thus was Valentinian the younger seated on his father's throne. Now this Valentinian was born of Justina, whom Valentinian the elder married while Severa his former wife was alive, under the following circumstances. Justus the father of Justina, who had been governor of Picenum under the reign of Constantius, had a dream in which he seemed to himself to bring forth the imperial purple out of his right side. When this dream had been told to many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, it at length came to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Constantius, who conjecturing it to be a presage that a descendant of Justus would become emperor, caused him to be assassinated. Justina being thus bereft of her father, still continued a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Some time after she became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Severa, wife of the emperor Valentinian, and had frequent intercourse with the empress, until their intimacy at length grew to such an extent that they were accustomed to bathe together. When Severa saw Justina in the bath she was greatly struck with the beauty of the virgin, and spoke of her to the emperor; saying that the daughter of Justus was so lovely a creature, and possessed of such symmetry of form, that she herself, though a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, was altogether charmed with her. The emperor, treasuring this description by his wife in his own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, considered with himself how he could espouse Justina, without repudiating Severa, as she had borne him Gratian, whom he had created Augustus a little while before. He accordingly framed a law, and caused it to be published throughout all the cities, by which any man was permitted to have two lawful wives.  The law was promulgated and he married Justina, by whom he had Valentinian the younger, and three daughters, Justa, Grata, and Galla; the two former of these remained <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>: but Calla was afterwards married to the emperor Theodosius the Great, who had by her a daughter named Placidia. For that prince had Arcadius and Honorius by Flaccilla his former wife: we shall however enter into particulars respecting Theodosius and his sons in the proper place.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 32. The Emperor Valens, appeased by the Oration of Themistius the Philosopher, abates his Persecution of the Christians.</h2>

<p>In the meanwhile Valens, making his residence at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, was wholly undisturbed by foreign <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>; for the barbarians on every side restrained themselves within their own boundaries. Nevertheless, he himself waged a most cruel <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against those who maintained the 'homoousian' doctrine, inflicting on them more grievous punishments every day; until the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Themistius by his <em>Appealing Oration</em>  somewhat moderated his severity. In this speech he tells the emperor, 'That he ought not to be surprised at the difference of judgment on religious questions existing among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; inasmuch as that discrepancy was trifling when compared with the multitude of conflicting opinions current among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>; for these amount to above three hundred; that dissension indeed was an inevitable consequence of this disagreement; but that God would be the more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by a diversity of sentiment, and the greatness of his majesty be more venerated, from the fact of its not being easy to have a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him.' The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> having said these and similar things, the emperor became milder, but did not completely give up his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; for although he ceased to put ecclesiastics to death, he continued to send them into exile, until this fury of his also was repressed by the following event.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 33. The Goths, under the Reign of Valens, embrace Christianity.</h2>

<p>The barbarians, dwelling beyond the Danube, called the Goths,  having engaged in a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> among themselves, were divided into two parties, one of which was headed by Fritigernes, the other by Athanaric. When the latter had obtained an evident advantage over his rival, Fritigernes had recourse to the Romans, and implored their assistance against his adversary. This was reported to the Emperor Valens, and he ordered the troops which were garrisoned in Thrace to assist those barbarians who had appealed to him against their more powerful countrymen; and by means of this subsidy they won a complete victory over Athanaric beyond the Danube, totally routing the enemy. This became the occasion for the conversion of many of the barbarians to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>:  for Fritigernes, to express his sense of the obligation the emperor had conferred upon him, embraced the religion of his benefactor, and urged those who were under his authority to do the same. Therefore it is that so many of the Goths are even to the present time infected with the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, they having on the occasion preferred to become adherents to that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> on the emperor's account. Ulfilas, their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at that time, invented the Gothic letters,  and translating the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> into their own language, undertook to instruct these barbarians in the Divine oracles. And as Ulfilas did not restrict his labors to the subjects of Fritigernes, but extended them to those who acknowledged the sway of Athanaric also, Athanaric regarding this as a violation of the privileges of the religion of his ancestors, subjected those who professed <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to severe punishments; so that many of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Goths of that period became <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> indeed, failing in his attempt to refute the opinion of Sabellius the Libyan, fell from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and asserted the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be 'a new God?': <span class="stiki" id="note260672"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse7">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:7</a></span> but the barbarians embracing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with greater simplicity of mind despised the present life for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. With these remarks we shall close our notice of the Christianized Goths.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 34. Admission of the Fugitive Goths into the Roman Territories, which caused the Emperor's Overthrow, and eventually the Ruin of the Roman Empire.</h2>

<p>Not long after the barbarians had entered into a friendly alliance with one another, they were again vanquished by other barbarians, their neighbors, called the Huns; and being driven out of their own country, they fled into the territory of the Romans, offering to be subject to the emperor, and to execute whatever he should command them. When Valens was made acquainted with this, not having the least presentiment of the consequences, he ordered that the suppliants should be received with kindness; in this one instance alone showing himself compassionate. He therefore assigned them certain parts of Thrace for their habitation, deeming himself peculiarly fortunate in this matter: for he calculated that in future he should possess a ready and well-equipped army against all assailants; and hoped that the barbarians would be a more formidable guard to the frontiers of the empire even than the Romans themselves. For this reason he in the future neglected to recruit his army by Roman levies; and despising those veterans who had bravely straggled and subdued his enemies in former <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, he put a pecuniary value on the militia which the inhabitants of the provinces, village by village, had been accustomed to furnish, ordering the collectors of his tribute to demand eighty pieces of gold for every soldier, although he had never before lightened the public burdens. This change was the origin of many disasters to the Roman empire subsequently.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35. Abatement of Persecution against the Christiansbecause of the War with the Goths.</h2>

<p>The barbarians having been put into possession of Thrace, and securely enjoying that Roman province, were unable to bear their good fortune with moderation; but committing hostile aggressions upon their benefactors, devastated all Thrace and the adjacent countries. When these proceedings came to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Valens, he desisted from sending the adherents of the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em> into banishment; and in great alarm left <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and came to Constantinople, where also the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was for the same reason come to an end. At the same time Euzo&iuml;us, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, departed this life, in the fifth consulate  of Valens, and the first of Valentinian the younger; and Dorotheus was appointed in his place.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 36. The Saracens, under Mavia their Queen, embrace Christianity; and Moses, a Pious Monk, is consecrated their Bishop.</h2>

<p>No sooner had the emperor departed from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, than the Saracens,  who had before been in alliance with the Romans, revolted from them, being led by Mavia their queen, whose husband was then dead. All the regions of the East therefore were at that time ravaged by the Saracens: but a certain <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine Providence</a> repressed their fury in the manner I am about to describe. A person named <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, a Saracen by birth, who led a monastic life in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, became exceedingly eminent for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Mavia the queen of the Saracens was therefore desirous that this person should be constituted <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> over her nation, and promised on the condition to terminate the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The Roman generals considering that a peace founded on such terms would be extremely advantageous, gave immediate directions for its ratification. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was accordingly seized, and brought from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, in order that he might there be invested with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>: but on his presentation for that purpose to Lucius, who at that time presided over the churches in that city, he refused to be ordained by him, protesting against it in these words: 'I account myself indeed unworthy of the sacred office; but if the exigencies of the state require my bearing it, it shall not be by Lucius laying his hand on me, for it has been filled with blood.' When Lucius told him that it was his duty to learn from him the principles of religion, and not to utter reproachful language, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> replied, 'Matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are not now in question: but your <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> practices against the brethren sufficiently prove that your doctrines are not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is <q>no striker, reviles not, does not fight</q>; for <q>it becomes not a servant of the Lord to fight.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note260675"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse24">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:24</a></span> But your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> cry out against you by those who have been sent into exile, who have been exposed to the wild beasts, and who had been delivered up to the flames. Those things which our own eyes have beheld are far more convincing than what we receive from the report of another.' As <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> expressed these and other similar sentiments his friends took him to the mountains, that he might receive ordination from those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who lived in exile there. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> having thus been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, the Saracen <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was terminated; and so scrupulously did Mavia observe the peace thus entered into with the Romans that she gave her daughter in marriage to Victor the commander-in-chief of the Roman army. Such were the transactions in relation to the Saracens.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 37. After the Departure of Valens from Antioch, the Alexandrians expel Lucius, and restore Peter, who had come with Letters from Damasus Bishop of Rome.</h2>

<p>About the same time, as soon as the Emperor Valens left <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, all those who had anywhere been suffering <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> began again to take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and especially those of Alexandria. Peter returned to that city from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with letters from Damasus the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman bishop</a>, in which he confirmed the 'homoousian' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and sanctioned Peter's ordination. The people therefore resuming confidence, expelled Lucius, who immediately embarked for Constantinople: but Peter survived his re-establishment a very short time, and at his death appointed his brother Timothy to succeed him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38. The Emperor Valens is ridiculed by the People on Account of the Goths; undertakes an Expedition against them and is slain in an Engagement near Adrianople.</h2>

<p>The Emperor Valens arrived at Constantinople on the 30th of May, in the sixth year of his own consulate,  and the second of Valentinian the Younger, and found the people in a very dejected state of mind: for the barbarians, who had already desolated Thrace, were now laying waste the very suburbs of Constantinople, there being no adequate force at hand to resist them. But when they undertook to make near approaches, even to the walls of the city, the people became exceedingly troubled, and began to murmur against the emperor; accusing him of having brought on the enemy there, and then indolently prolonging the struggle there, instead of at once marching out against the barbarians. Moreover at the exhibition of the sports of the Hippodrome, all with one voice clamored against the emperor's negligence of the public affairs, crying out with great earnestness, 'Give us arms, and we ourselves will fight.' The emperor provoked at these seditious clamors, marched out of the city, on the 11th of June; threatening that if he returned, he would punish the citizens not only for their insolent reproaches, but for having previously favored the pretensions of the usurper Procopius; declaring also that he would utterly demolish their city, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the plough to pass over its ruins, he advanced against the barbarians, whom he routed with great slaughter, and pursued as far as Adrianople, a city of Thrace, situated on the frontiers of Macedonia. Having at that place again engaged the enemy, who had by this time rallied, he lost his life on the 9th of August, under the consulate just mentioned, and in the fourth year of the 289th Olympiad. Some have asserted that he was burnt to death in a village whither he had retired, which the barbarians assaulted and set on fire. But others affirm that having put off his imperial robe he ran into the midst of the main body of infantry; and that when the cavalry revolted and refused to engage, the infantry were surrounded by the barbarians, and completely destroyed in a body. Among these it is said the emperor fell, but could not be distinguished, in consequence of his not having on his imperial habit. He died in the fiftieth year of his age, having reigned in conjunction with his brother thirteen years, and three years after the death of the brother. This book therefore contains [the course of events during] the space of sixteen years.<br> <br></p>
