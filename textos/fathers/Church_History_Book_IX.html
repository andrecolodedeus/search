<h1>Church History (Book IX)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. The Pretended Relaxation.</h2>

<p>1. The imperial edict of recantation, which has been quoted above,  was posted in all parts of Asia and in the adjoining provinces. After this had been done, Maximinus, the tyrant in the East&mdash;a most impious man, if there ever was one, and most hostile to the religion of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>&mdash;being by no means satisfied with its contents,  instead of sending the above-quoted decree to the governors under him, gave them verbal commands to relax the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against us.</p>

<p>2. For since he could not in any other way oppose the decision of his superiors, keeping the law which had been already issued secret, and taking care that it might not be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the district under him, he gave an unwritten order to his governors that they should relax the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against us. They communicated the command to each other in writing.</p>

<p>3. Sabinus,  at least, who was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with the highest official rank among them, communicated the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the emperor to the provincial governors in a Latin epistle, the translation of which is as follows:</p>

<p>4. With continuous and most devoted earnestness their Majesties, our most divine masters, the emperors,  formerly directed the minds of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to follow the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and correct course of life, that those also who seemed to live in a manner foreign to that of the Romans, should render the worship due to the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods. But the obstinacy and most unconquerable determination of some went so far that they could neither be turned back from their purpose by the just reason of the command, nor be intimidated by the impending punishment.</p>

<p>5. Since therefore it has come to pass that by such conduct many have brought themselves into danger, their Majesties, our most powerful masters, the emperors, in the exalted nobility of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, esteeming it foreign to their Majesties' purpose to bring men into so great danger for such a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, have commanded their devoted servant, myself, to write to your wisdom,  that if any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> be found engaging in the worship of his own people, you should abstain from molesting and endangering him, and should not suppose it necessary to punish any one on this pretext. For it has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the experience of so long a time that they can in no way be persuaded to abandon such obstinate conduct.</p>

<p>6. Therefore it should be your care to write to the curators  and magistrates and district overseers  of every city, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is not necessary for them to give further attention to this matter. </p>

<p>7. Thereupon the rulers of the provinces,  thinking that the purpose of the things which were written was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them, declared the imperial will to the curators and magistrates and prefects of the various districts  in writing. But they did not limit themselves to writing, but sought more quickly to accomplish the supposed will of the emperor in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> also. Those whom they had imprisoned on account of their confession of the Deity, they set at liberty, and they released those of them who had been sent to the mines for punishment; for they erroneously supposed that this was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> will of the emperor.</p>

<p>8. And when these things had thus been done, immediately, like a light shining forth in a dark night, one could see in every city congregations gathered and assemblies thronged, and meetings held according to their custom. And every one of the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> was not a little astonished at these things, wondering at so marvelous a transformation, and exclaiming that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was great and alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</p>

<p>9. And some of our people, who had faithfully and bravely sustained the conflict of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, again became frank and bold toward all; but as many as had been diseased in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and had been shaken in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by the tempest, strove eagerly for healing, beseeching and imploring the strong to stretch out to them a saving hand, and supplicating God to be merciful unto them.</p>

<p>10. Then also the noble athletes of religion who had been set free from their sufferings in the mines returned to their own homes. Happily and joyfully they passed through every city, full of unspeakable pleasure and of a boldness which cannot be expressed in words.</p>

<p>11. Great crowds of men pursued their journey along the highways and through the market-places, praising God with <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and psalms. And you might have seen those who a little while before had been driven in bonds from their native countries under a most cruel sentence, returning with bright and joyful faces to their own firesides; so that even they who had formerly thirsted for our blood, when they saw the unexpected wonder, congratulated us on what had taken place.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The Subsequent Reverse.</h2>

<p>1. But the tyrant who, as we have said, ruled over the districts of the Orient, a thorough hater of the good and an enemy of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> person, as he was, could no longer bear this; and indeed he did not permit matters to go on in this way quite six months.  Devising all possible means of destroying the peace, he first attempted to restrain us, under a pretext,  from meeting in the cemeteries.</p>

<p>2. Then through the agency of some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men he sent an embassy to himself against us,  inciting the citizens of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> to ask from him as a very great favor that he would by no means permit any of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to dwell in their country; and others were secretly induced to do the same thing. The author of all this in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> was Theotecnus,  a violent and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man, who was an <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a>, and whose character was foreign to his name.  He appears to have been the curator  of the city.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. The Newly Erected Statue at Antioch.</h2>

<p>After this man had carried on all kinds of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against us and had caused our people to be diligently hunted up in their retreats, as if they were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> thieves, and had devised every sort of <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> and accusation against us, and become the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death to vast numbers, he finally erected a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Jupiter Philius  with certain juggleries and magic <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. And after inventing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> forms of initiation and ill-omened <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> in connection with it, and abominable means of purification,  he exhibited his jugglery, by oracles which he pretended to utter, even to the emperor; and through a flattery which was pleasing to the ruler he aroused the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and said that the god had given command to expel the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as his enemies beyond the confines of the city and the neighboring districts.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Memorials against us.</h2> 

<p>1. The fact that this man, who took the lead in this matter, had succeeded in his purpose was an incitement to all the other officials in the cities under the same government to prepare a similar memorial.  And the governors of the provinces perceiving that this was agreeable to the emperor suggested to their subjects that they should do the same.</p>

<p>2. And as the tyrant by a rescript declared himself well pleased with their measures,  <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was kindled anew against us. Priests for the images were then appointed in the cities, and besides them <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> by Maximinus himself.  The latter were taken from among those who were most distinguished in public life and had gained celebrity in all the offices which they had filled; and who were imbued, moreover, with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the service of those whom they worshipped.</p>

<p>3. Indeed, the extraordinary <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of the emperor, to speak in brief, led all his subjects, both rulers and private citizens, for the sake of gratifying him, to do everything against us, supposing that they could best show their gratitude to him for the benefits which they had received from him, by plotting <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> against us and exhibiting toward us any new signs of malignity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The Forged Acts.</h2>

<p>1. Having therefore forged Acts of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>  and our Saviour full of every kind of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they sent them with the emperor's approval to the whole of the empire subject to him, with written commands that they should be openly posted to the view of all in every place, both in country and city, and that the schoolmasters should give them to their scholars, instead of their customary lessons, to be studied and learned by heart.</p>

<p>2. While these things were taking place, another military commander, whom the Romans call Dux,  seized some <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the market-place at Damascus in <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>,  and by threatening to inflict tortures upon them compelled them to make a written declaration that they had once been <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and that they were acquainted with their impious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>&mdash;that in their very churches they committed licentious acts; and they uttered as many other <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> against our religion as he wished them to. Having taken down their words in writing, he communicated them to the emperor, who commanded that these documents also should be published in every place and city.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Those who suffered Martyrdom at this Time.</h2>

<p>1. Not long afterward, however, this military commander became his own murderer and paid the penalty for his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. But we were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> again to endure exile and severe <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, and the governors in every province were once more terribly stirred up against us; so that even some of those illustrious in the Divine Word were seized and had sentence of death pronounced upon them without mercy. Three of them in the city of Emesa  in <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, having confessed that they were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, were thrown as food to the wild beasts. Among them was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Silvanus,  a very old man, who had filled his office full forty years.</p>

<p>2. At about the same time Peter  also, who presided most illustriously over the parishes in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, a divine example of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on account of the excellence of his life and his study of the sacred Scriptures, being seized for no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and quite unexpectedly, was, as if by command of Maximinus, immediately and without explanation, beheaded. With him also many other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> suffered the same <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>.</p>

<p>3. And Lucian,  a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the parish at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and a most excellent man in every respect, temperate in life and famed for his learning in sacred things, was brought to the city of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, where at that time the emperor happened to be staying, and after delivering before the ruler an apology for the doctrine which he professed, was committed to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</p>

<p>4. Such trials were brought upon us in a brief time by Maximinus, the enemy of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so that this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which was stirred up against us seemed far more cruel than the former.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Decree against us which was engraved on Pillars.</h2>

<p>1. The memorials against us  and copies of the imperial edicts issued in reply to them were engraved and set up on brazen pillars in the midst of the cities, &mdash; a course which had never been followed elsewhere. The children in the schools had daily in their mouths the names of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and the Acts which had been forged in wanton insolence. </p>

<p>2. It appears to me necessary to insert here this document of Maximinus which was posted on pillars, in order that there may be made manifest at the same time the boastful and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> arrogance of the God-hating man, and the sleepless evil-hating divine vengeance upon the impious, which followed close upon him, and under whose pressure he not long afterward took the opposite course in respect to us and confirmed it by written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. </p>

<p>The rescript is in the following words:</p>

<p> <em>Copy of a translation of the rescript of Maximinus in answer to the memorials against us, taken from the pillar in <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>.</em></p>

<p>3. Now at length the feeble power of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind has become able to shake off and to scatter every dark mist of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, which before this besieged the senses of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who were more miserable than impious, and enveloped them in dark and destructive <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; and to perceive that it is governed and established  by the beneficent <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods.</p>

<p>4. It passes belief how grateful, how pleasing and how agreeable it is to us, that you have given a most decided <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> resolution; for even before this it was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to every one how much regard and reverence you were paying to the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods, exhibiting not a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of bare and empty words, but continued and wonderful examples of illustrious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</p>

<p>5. Wherefore your city may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be called a seat and dwelling of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods. At least, it appears by many signs that it flourishes because of the presence of the celestial gods.</p>

<p>6. Behold, therefore, your city, regardless of all private advantages, and omitting its former petitions in its own behalf, when it perceived that the adherents of that execrable vanity were again beginning to spread, and to start the greatest conflagration&mdash;like a neglected and extinguished funeral pile when its brands are rekindled,&mdash; immediately resorted to our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> as to a metropolis of all religiousness, asking some remedy and aid.</p>

<p>7. It is evident that the gods have given you this saving mind on account of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.</p>

<p>Accordingly that supreme and mightiest Jove, who presides over your illustrious city, who preserves your ancestral gods, your wives and children, your hearths and homes from every destructive pest, has infused into your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> this wholesome resolve; showing and proving how excellent and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and salutary it is to observe with the becoming reverence the worship and sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods.</p>

<p>8. For who can be found so <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> or so devoid of all understanding as not to perceive that it is due to the kindly care of the gods that the earth does not refuse the seed sown in it, nor disappoint the hope of the husbandmen with vain expectation; that impious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is not inevitably fixed upon earth, and wasted bodies dragged down to death under the influence of a corrupted atmosphere; that the sea is not swollen and raised on high by blasts of intemperate winds; that unexpected hurricanes do not burst forth and stir up the destructive tempest; moreover, that the earth, the nourisher and mother of all, is not shaken from its lowest depths with a terrible tremor, and that the mountains upon it do not sink into the opening chasms. No one is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that all these, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> still worse than these, have oftentimes happened hitherto.</p>

<p>9. And all these misfortunes have taken place on account of the destructive <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the empty vanity of those impious men, when it prevailed in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and, we may almost say, weighed down the whole world with shame.</p>

<p>10. After other words he adds: Let them look at the standing crops already flourishing with waving heads in the broad fields, and at the meadows glittering with plants and flowers, in response to abundant rains and the restored mildness and softness of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>11. Finally, let all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that the might of the most powerful and terrible Mars has been propitiated by our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, our <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and our veneration; and let them on this account enjoy firm and tranquil peace and quiet; and let as many as have wholly abandoned that blind <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and delusion and have returned to a right and sound mind <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> the more, as those who have been rescued from an unexpected storm or severe disease and are to reap the fruits of pleasure for the rest of their life.</p>

<p>12. But if they still persist in their execrable vanity, let them, as you have desired, be driven far away from your city and territory, that thus, in accordance with your praiseworthy <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in this matter, your city, being freed from every pollution and impiety, may, according to its native disposition, attend to the sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods with becoming reverence.</p>

<p>13. But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how acceptable to us your request respecting this matter has been, and how ready our mind is to confer benefits voluntarily, without memorials and petitions, we permit your devotion to ask whatever great gift ye may desire in return for this your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> disposition.</p>

<p>14. And now ask that this may be done and that you may receive it; for you shall obtain it without delay. This, being granted to your city, shall furnish for all time an evidence of reverent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> toward the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods, and of the fact that you have obtained from our benevolence merited prizes for this choice of yours; and it shall be shown to your children and children's children.</p>

<p>15. This was published against us in all the provinces, depriving us of every hope of good, at least from men; so that, according to that divine utterance, <q>If it were possible, even the elect would have stumbled</q> <span class="stiki" id="note252742"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;24:24</a></span> at these things.</p>

<p>16. And now indeed, when the hope of most of us was almost extinct, suddenly while those who were to execute against us the above decree had in some places scarcely finished their journey, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the defender of his own Church, exhibited his heavenly interposition in our behalf, nearly stopping the tyrant's boasting against us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. The Misfortunes which happened in Connection with these Things, in Famine, Pestilence, and War.</h2>

<p>1. The customary rains and showers of the winter season ceased to fall in their wonted abundance upon the earth and an unexpected famine made its appearance, and in addition to this a pestilence, and another severe disease consisting of an ulcer, which on account of its fiery appearance was appropriately called a carbuncle.  This, spreading over the whole body, greatly endangered the lives of those who suffered from it; but as it chiefly attacked the eyes, it deprived multitudes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and children of their sight.</p>

<p>2. In addition to this the tyrant was compelled to go to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Armenians, who had been from ancient times friends and allies of the Romans. As they were also <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>  and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> toward the Deity, the enemy of God had attempted to compel them to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and had thus made friends foes, and allies enemies.</p>

<p>3. All these things suddenly took place at one and the same time, and refuted the tyrant's empty boast against the Deity. For he had boasted that, because of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and his hostility against us, neither famine nor pestilence nor <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> had happened in his time.  These things, therefore, coming upon him at once and together, furnished a prelude also of his own destruction.</p>

<p>4. He himself with his forces was defeated in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Armenians, and the rest of the inhabitants of the cities under him were terribly afflicted with famine and pestilence, so that one measure of wheat was sold for twenty-five hundred Attic drachms. </p>

<p>5. Those who died in the cities were innumerable, and those who died in the country and villages were still more. So that the tax lists which formerly included a great rural population were almost entirely wiped out; nearly all being speedily destroyed by famine and pestilence.</p>

<p>6. Some, therefore, desired to dispose of their most precious things to those who were better supplied, in return for the smallest morsel of food, and others, selling their possessions little by little, fell into the last extremity of want. Some, chewing wisps of hay and recklessly eating noxious herbs, undermined and ruined their constitutions.</p>

<p>7. And some of the high-born <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the cities, driven by want to shameful extremities, went forth into the market-places to beg, giving evidence of their former liberal culture by the modesty of their appearance and the decency of their apparel.</p>

<p>8. Some, wasted away like ghosts and at the very point of death, stumbled and tottered here and there, and too weak to stand fell down in the middle of the streets; lying stretched out at full length they begged that a small morsel of food might be given them, and with their last gasp they cried out Hunger! Having strength only for this most painful cry.</p>

<p>9. But others, who seemed to be better supplied, astonished at the multitude of the beggars, after giving away large quantities, finally became hard and relentless, expecting that they themselves also would soon suffer the same calamities as those who begged. So that in the midst of the market-places and lanes, dead and naked bodies lay unburied for many days, presenting the most lamentable spectacle to those that beheld them.</p>

<p>10. Some also became food for dogs, on which account the survivors began to kill the dogs, lest they should become mad and should go to devouring men.</p>

<p>11. But still worse was the pestilence which consumed entire houses and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and especially those whom the famine was not able to destroy because of their abundance of food. Thus men of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, rulers and governors and multitudes in office, as if left by the famine on purpose for the pestilence, suffered swift and speedy death. Every place therefore was full of lamentation; in every lane and market-place and street there was nothing else to be seen or heard than tears, with the customary instruments and the voices of the mourners. </p>

<p>12. In this way death, waging <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with these two weapons, pestilence and famine, destroyed whole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in a short time, so that one could see two or three dead bodies carried out at once.</p>

<p>13. Such were the rewards of the boasting of Maximinus and of the measures of the cities against us.</p>

<p>Then did the evidences of the universal <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> become manifest to all the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>.</p>

<p>14. For they alone in the midst of such ills showed their sympathy and humanity by their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Every day some continued caring for and burying the dead, for there were multitudes who had no one to care for them; others collected in one place those who were afflicted by the famine, throughout the entire city, and gave bread to them all; so that the thing became noised abroad among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; and, convinced by the facts themselves, confessed that they alone were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and religious.</p>

<p>15. After these things were thus done, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the great and celestial defender of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, having revealed in the events which have been described his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and indignation at all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for the great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which they had brought upon us, restored to us the bright and gracious sunlight of his <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> in our behalf; so that in the deepest darkness a light of peace shone most wonderfully upon us from him, and made it manifest to all that God himself has always been the ruler of our affairs. From time to time indeed he chastens his people and corrects them by his visitations, but again after sufficient chastisement he shows mercy and favor to those who <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> in him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The Victory of the God-Beloved Emperors.</h2> 

<p>1. Thus when Constantine, whom we have already mentioned  as an emperor, born of an emperor, a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> son of a most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> father, and Licinius, second to him, &mdash; two God-beloved emperors, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> alike for their intelligence and their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>&mdash;being stirred up against the two most impious tyrants by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the absolute Ruler and Saviour of all, engaged in formal <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against them, with God as their ally, Maxentius  was defeated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Constantine in a remarkable manner, and the tyrant of the East  did not long survive him, but met a most shameful death at the hand of Licinius, who had not yet become insane. </p>

<p>2. Constantine, who was the superior both in dignity and imperial rank,  first took compassion upon those who were oppressed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and having invoked in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of heaven, and his Word, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> himself, the Saviour of all, as his aid, advanced with his whole army,  proposing to restore to the Romans their ancestral liberty.</p>

<p>3. But Maxentius, putting confidence rather in the arts of sorcery than in the devotion of his subjects, did not dare to go forth beyond the gates of the city, but fortified every place and district and town which was enslaved by him, in the neighborhood of Rome and in all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, with an immense multitude of troops and with innumerable bands of soldiers. But the emperor, relying upon the assistance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, attacked the first, second, and third army of the tyrant, and conquered them all; and having advanced through the greater part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was already very near Rome.</p>

<p>4. Then, that he might not be compelled to wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Romans for the sake of the tyrant, God himself drew the latter, as if bound in chains, some distance without the gates, and confirmed those threats against the impious which had been anciently inscribed in sacred books&mdash;disbelieved, indeed, by most as a myth, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by the faithful,&mdash; confirmed them, in a word, by the deed itself to all, both <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> and unbelievers, that saw the wonder with their eyes.</p>

<p>5. Thus, as in the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself and of the ancient God-beloved race of Hebrews, <q>he cast <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> chariots and host into the sea, and overwhelmed his chosen charioteers in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, and covered them with the flood,</q>  in the same way Maxentius also with his soldiers and body-guards <q>went down into the depths like a stone,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note252757"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse5">Exodus&nbsp;15:5</a></span> when he fled before the power of God which was with Constantine, and passed through the river which lay in his way, over which he had formed a bridge with boats, and thus prepared the means of his own destruction.</p>

<p>6. In regard to him one might say, <q>he dug a pit and opened it and fell into the hole which he had made; his labor shall turn upon his own head, and his unrighteousness shall fall upon his own crown.</q> </p>

<p>7. Thus, then, the bridge over the river being broken, the passageway settled down, and immediately the boats with the men disappeared in the depths, and that most impious one himself first of all, then the shield-bearers who were with him, as the divine oracles foretold, <q>sank like lead in the mighty waters</q>; <span class="stiki" id="note252759"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse10">Exodus&nbsp;15:10</a></span> so that those who obtained the victory from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if not in words, at least in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, like <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the great servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and those who were with him, fittingly sang as they had sung against the impious tyrant of old, saying, <q>Let us sing unto the Lord, for he has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> himself; horse and rider has he thrown into the sea; a helper and a protector has he become for my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>;</q>  and <q>Who is like you, O Lord; among the gods, who is like you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>,  marvelous in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, doing wonders.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note252762"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse11">Exodus&nbsp;15:11</a></span> </p>

<p>8. These and the like praises Constantine, by his very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, sang to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the universal Ruler, and Author of his victory, as he entered Rome in triumph.</p>

<p>9. Immediately all the members of the senate and the other most celebrated men, with the whole Roman people, together with children and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, received him as their deliverer, their saviour, and their benefactor, with shining eyes and with their whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, with shouts of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> and unbounded <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</p>

<p>10. But he, as one possessed of inborn <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> toward <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, did not exult in the shouts, nor was he elated by the praises; but perceiving that his aid was from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he immediately commanded that a trophy of the Saviour's passion be put in the hand of his own <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>.</p>

<p>11. And when he had placed it, with the saving <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> in its right hand, in the most public place in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he commanded that the following inscription should be engraved upon it in the Roman tongue: <q>By this salutary sign, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>, I have saved and freed your city from the yoke of the tyrant and moreover, having set at liberty both the senate and the people of Rome, I have restored them to their ancient distinction and splendor.</q> </p>

<p>12. And after this both Constantine himself and with him the Emperor Licinius, who had not yet been seized by that <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> into which he later fell,  praising God as the author of all their blessings, with one will and mind drew up a full and most complete decree in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>,  and sent an account of the wonderful things done for them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of the victory over the tyrant, together with a copy of the decree itself, to Maximinus, who still ruled over the nations of the East and pretended friendship toward them.</p>

<p>13. But he, like a tyrant, was greatly pained by what he learned; but not wishing to seem to yield to others, nor, on the other hand, to suppress that which was commanded, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of those who enjoined it, as if on his own authority, he addressed, under compulsion, to the governors under him this first communication in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>,  <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> inventing things against himself which had never been done by him.</p>

<p> <em>Copy of a translation of the epistle of the tyrant Maximinus.</em></p>

<p>14. Jovius Maximinus Augustus to Sabinus.  I am confident that it is manifest both to your firmness and to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that our masters <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> and Maximianus, our fathers, when they saw almost all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> abandoning the worship of the gods and attaching themselves to the party of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, rightly decreed that all who gave up the worship of those same <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods should be recalled by open chastisement and punishment to the worship of the gods.</p>

<p>15. But when I first came to the East under favorable auspices and learned that in some places a great many men who were able to render public service had been banished by the judges for the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, I gave command to each of the judges that henceforth none of them should treat the provincials with severity, but that they should rather recall them to the worship of the gods by flattery and exhortations. </p>

<p>16. Then when, in accordance with my command, these orders were <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> by the judges, it came to pass that none of those who lived in the districts of the East were banished or insulted, but that they were rather brought back to the worship of the gods by the fact that no severity was employed toward them.</p>

<p>17. But afterwards, when I went up last year  under good auspices to <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> and sojourned there, citizens of the same city came to me with the images of the gods, earnestly entreating that such a people should by no means be permitted to dwell in their country. </p>

<p>18. But when I learned that many men of the same religion dwelt in those regions, I replied that I gladly thanked them for their request, but that I perceived that it was not proffered by all, and that if, therefore, there were any that persevered in the same <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, each one had the privilege of doing as he pleased, even if he wished to recognize the worship of the gods. </p>

<p>19. Nevertheless, I considered it necessary to give a friendly answer to the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> and to the other cities which had so earnestly presented to me the same petition, namely, that no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should dwell in their cities&mdash;both because this same course had been pursued by all the ancient emperors, and also because it was pleasing to the gods, through whom all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and the government of the state itself endure&mdash;and to confirm the request which they presented in behalf of the worship of their deity.</p>

<p>20. Therefore, although before this time, special letters have been sent to your devotedness, and commands have likewise been given that no harsh measures should be taken against those provincials who desire to follow such a course, but that they should be treated mildly and moderately&mdash;nevertheless, in order that they may not suffer insults or extortions  from the beneficiaries,  or from any others, I have thought meet to remind your firmness in this epistle  also that you should lead our provincials rather by flatteries and exhortations to recognize the care of the gods.</p>

<p>21. Hence, if any one of his own choice should decide to adopt the worship of the gods, it is fitting that he should be welcomed, but if any should wish to follow their own religion, do thou leave it in their power.</p>

<p>22. Wherefore it behooves your devotedness to observe that which is committed to you, and to see that power is given to no one to oppress our provincials with insults and extortions,  since, as already written, it is fitting to recall our provincials to the worship of the gods rather by exhortations and flatteries. But, in order that this command of ours may come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all our provincials, it is incumbent upon you to proclaim that which has been enjoined, in an edict issued by yourself.</p>

<p>23. Since he was forced to do this by necessity and did not give the command by his own will, he was not regarded by any one as sincere or trustworthy, because he had already shown his unstable and deceitful disposition after his former similar concession.</p>

<p>24. None of our people, therefore, ventured to hold meetings or even to appear in public, because his communication did not cover this, but only commanded to guard against doing us any injury, and did not give orders that we should hold meetings or build churches or perform any of our customary acts.</p>

<p>25. And yet Constantine and Licinius, the advocates of peace and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, had written him to permit this, and had granted it to all their subjects by edicts and ordinances.  But this most impious man did not choose to yield in this matter until, being driven by the divine judgment, he was at last compelled to do it against his will.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. The Overthrow of the Tyrants and the Words which they uttered before their Death.</h2> 

<p>1. The circumstances which drove him to this course were the following. Being no longer able to sustain the magnitude of the government which had been undeservedly committed to him, in consequence of his want of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and imperial understanding, he managed affairs in a base manner, and with his mind unreasonably exalted in all things with boastful <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, even toward his colleagues in the empire who were in every respect his superiors, in birth, in training, in education, in worth and intelligence, and, greatest of all, in <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> toward the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he began to venture to act audaciously and to arrogate to himself the first rank. </p>

<p>2. Becoming mad in his folly, he broke the treaties which he had made with Licinius  and undertook an implacable <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Then in a brief time he threw all things into confusion, and stirred up every city, and having collected his entire force, comprising an immense number of soldiers, he went forth to battle with him, elated by his hopes in <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whom he supposed to be gods, and by the number of his soldiers.</p>

<p>3. And when he joined battle  he was deprived of the oversight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the victory was given to Licinius,  who was then ruling, by the one and only God of all.</p>

<p>4. First, the army in which he trusted was destroyed, and as all his guards abandoned him and left him alone, and fled to the victor, he secretly divested himself as quickly as possible of the imperial garments, which did not fitly belong to him, and in a cowardly and ignoble and unmanly way mingled with the crowd, and then fled, concealing himself in fields and villages.  But though he was so careful for his safety, he scarcely escaped the hands of his enemies, revealing by his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that the divine oracles are faithful and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, in which it is said, A king is not saved by a great force, and a giant shall not be saved by the greatness of his strength; a horse is a vain thing for safety, nor shall he be delivered by the greatness of his power.</p>

<p>5. Behold, the eyes of the Lord are upon them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> him, upon them that hope in his mercy, to deliver their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from death. </p>

<p>6. Thus the tyrant, covered with shame, went to his own country. And first, in frantic rage, he slew many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the gods whom he had formerly admired, and whose oracles had incited him to undertake the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, as sorcerers and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a>, and besides all as betrayers of his safety. Then having given <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and enacted a most full and complete ordinance in behalf of their liberty,  he was immediately seized with a mortal disease, and no respite being granted him, departed this life.  The law enacted by him was as follows:</p>

<p> <em>Copy of the edict of the tyrant in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, translated from the Roman tongue.</em></p>

<p>7. The Emperor C&aelig;sar Caius Valerius Maximinus, Germanicus, Sarmaticus, Pius, Felix, Invictus, Augustus. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it manifest that no one is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, but that every man who looks back over the past <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and is conscious that in every way we care continually for the good of our provincials, and wish to furnish them with those things which are of special advantage to all, and for the common benefit and profit, and whatever contributes to the public welfare and is agreeable to the views of each.</p>

<p>8. When, therefore, before this, it became clear to our mind that under pretext of the command of our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, the most divine <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> and Maximianus, which enjoined that the meetings of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should be abolished, many extortions  and spoliations had been practiced by officials; and that those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> were continually increasing, to the detriment of our provincials toward whom we are especially anxious to exercise proper care, and that their possessions were in consequence perishing, letters were sent last year  to the governors of each province, in which we decreed that, if any one wished to follow such a practice or to observe this same religion, he should be permitted without hindrance to pursue his purpose and should be impeded and prevented by no one, and that all should have liberty to do without any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or suspicion that which each preferred.</p>

<p>9. But even now we cannot help perceiving that some of the judges have mistaken our commands, and have given our people reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the meaning of our ordinances, and have caused them to proceed too reluctantly to the observance of those religious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> which are pleasing to them.</p>

<p>10. In order, therefore, that in the future every suspicion of fearful <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> may be taken away, we have commanded that this decree be published, so that it may be clear to all that whoever wishes to embrace this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> and religion is permitted to do so by virtue of this grant of ours; and that each one, as he wishes or as is pleasing to him, is permitted to practice this religion which he has chosen to observe according to his custom. It is also granted them to build Lord's houses.</p>

<p>11. But that this grant of ours may be the greater, we have thought good to decree also that if any houses and lands before this time rightfully belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and by the command of our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> fell into the treasury, or were confiscated by any city&mdash;whether they have been sold or presented to any one as a gift,&mdash; that all these should be restored to their original possessors, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, in order that in this also every one may have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and care.</p>

<p>12. These are the words of the tyrant which were published not quite a year after the decrees against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> engraved by him on pillars.  And by him to whom a little before we seemed impious wretches and <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a> and destroyers of all life, so that we were not permitted to dwell in any city nor even in country or desert,&mdash; by him decrees and ordinances were issued in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and they who recently had been destroyed by fire and sword, by wild beasts and birds of prey, in the presence of the tyrant himself, and had suffered every species of torture and punishment, and most miserable deaths as <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a> and impious wretches, were now acknowledged by him as possessors of religion and were permitted to build churches; and the tyrant himself bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and confessed that they had some rights.</p>

<p>13. And having made such confessions, as if he had received some benefit on account of them, he suffered perhaps less than he ought to have suffered, and being smitten by a sudden scourge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he perished in the second campaign of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</p>

<p>14. But his end was not like that of military chieftains who, while fighting bravely in battle for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and friends, often boldly encounter a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> death; for like an impious enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while his army was still drawn up in the field, remaining at home and concealing himself, he suffered the punishment which he deserved. For he was smitten with a sudden scourge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in his whole body, and harassed by terrible pains and torments, he fell prostrate on the ground, wasted by hunger, while all his flesh was dissolved by an invisible and God-sent fire, so that the whole appearance of his frame was changed, and there was left only a kind of image wasted away by length of time to a skeleton of dry bones; so that those who were present could think of his body as nothing else than the tomb of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which was buried in a body already dead and completely melted away.</p>

<p>15. And as the heat still more violently consumed him in the depths of his marrow, his eyes burst forth, and falling from their sockets left him blind. Thereupon still breathing and making free confession to the Lord, he invoked death, and at last, after acknowledging that he <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> suffered these things on account of his <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he gave up the ghost.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. The Final Destruction of the Enemies of Religion.</h2>

<p>1. Thus when Maximinus, who alone had remained of the enemies of religion  and had appeared the worst of them all, was put out of the way, the renovation of the churches from their foundations was begun by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God the Ruler of all, and the word of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, shining unto the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, obtained greater freedom than before, while the impious enemies of religion were covered with extremest shame and dishonor.</p>

<p>2. For Maximinus himself, being first pronounced by the emperors a common enemy, was declared by public proclamations to be a most impious, execrable, and God-hating tyrant. And of the portraits which had been set up in every city in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of him or of his children, some were thrown down from their places to the ground, and torn in pieces; while the faces of others were obliterated by daubing them with black paint. And the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> which had been erected to his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> were likewise overthrown and broken, and lay exposed to the laughter and sport of those who wished to insult and abuse them.</p>

<p>3. Then also all the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> of the other enemies of religion were taken away, and all those who sided with Maximinus were slain, especially those who had been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by him with high offices in reward for their flattery, and had behaved insolently toward our doctrine.</p>

<p>4. Such an one was Peucetius,  the dearest of his companions, who had been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> and rewarded by him above all, who had been consul a second and third time, and had been appointed by him chief minister;  and Culcianus,  who had likewise advanced through every grade of office, and was also celebrated for his numberless executions of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>;  and besides these not a few others, by whose agency especially the tyranny of Maximinus had been confirmed and extended.</p>

<p>5. And Theotecnus  also was summoned by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which by no means overlooked his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. For when the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> had been set up by him at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>,  he appeared to be in the happiest state, and was already made a governor by Maximinus.</p>

<p>6. But Licinius, coming down to the city of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, made a search for <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a>, and tortured the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the newly erected <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, asking them for what reason they practiced their deception. They, under the stress of torture, were unable longer to conceal the matter, and declared that the whole deceptive <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> had been devised by the art of Theotecnus. Therefore, after meting out to all of them just judgment, he first put Theotecnus himself to death, and then his confederates in the imposture, with the severest possible tortures.</p>

<p>7. To all these were added also the children  of Maximinus, whom he had already made sharers in the imperial dignity, by placing their names on tablets and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> of the tyrant, who before had been boastful and had in their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> oppressed all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, suffered the same punishments with those who have been already mentioned, as well as the extremest disgrace. For they had not received instruction, neither did they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and understand the exhortation given in the Holy Word:</p>

<p>8. <q>Put not your trust in princes, nor in the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in whom there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; his spirit shall go forth and return to his earth; in that day all their thoughts perish.</q> </p>

<p>9. The impious ones having been thus removed, the government was preserved firm and undisputed for Constantine and Licinius, to whom it fittingly belonged. They, having first of all cleansed the world of hostility to the Divine Being, conscious of the benefits which he had conferred upon them, showed their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and gratitude to the Deity, by their ordinance in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. </p>
