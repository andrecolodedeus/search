<h1>Church History (Book I)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Introduction to the Work.</h2>

<p>Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus,  writing the History of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>  in ten books, closed it with that period of the emperor Constantine, when the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> had begun against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> came to an end. Also in writing the life of Constantine, this same author has but slightly treated of matters regarding <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, being more intent on the rhetorical finish of his composition and the praises of the emperor, than on an accurate statement of facts. Now, as we propose to write the details of what has taken place in the churches since his time to our own day, we begin with the narration of the particulars which he has left out, and we shall not be solicitous to display a parade of words, but to lay before the reader what we have been able to collect from documents, and what we have heard from those who were familiar with the facts as they told them. And since it has an important bearing on the matter in hand, it will be proper to enter into a brief account of Constantine's conversion to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, making a beginning with this event.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. By what Means the Emperor Constantine became a Christian.</h2>

<p>When <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> and Maximian,  surnamed Herculius, had by mutual consent laid aside the imperial dignity, and retired into private life, Maximian, surnamed Galerius, who had been a sharer with them in the government, came into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and appointed two C&aelig;sars, Maximin in the eastern division of the empire, and Severus in the Italian. In Britain, however, Constantine was proclaimed emperor, instead of his father Constantius, who died in the first year of the two hundred and seventy-first  Olympiad, on the 25th of July. And at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Maxentius, the son of Maximian Herculius, was raised by the pr&aelig;torian soldiers to be a tyrant rather than an emperor. In this state of things Herculius, impelled by a desire to regain the sovereignty, attempted to destroy his son Maxentius; but this he was prevented by the soldiery from effecting, and he soon afterwards died at Tarsus in Cilicia. At the same time Severus C&aelig;sar being sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Galerius Maximian, in order to seize Maxentius, was slain, his own soldiers having betrayed him. At length Galerius Maximian, who had exercised the chief authority,  also died, having previously appointed as his successor, his old friend and companion in arms, Licinius, a Dacian by birth. Meanwhile, Maxentius sorely oppressed the Roman people, treating them as a tyrant rather than as a king, shamelessly violating the wives of the nobles, putting many innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to death, and perpetrating other similar atrocities. The emperor Constantine being informed of this, exerted himself to free the Romans from the slavery under him (i.e. Maxentius), and began immediately to consider by what means he might overthrow the tyrant. Now while his mind was occupied with  this great subject, he debated as to what divinity's aid he should invoke in the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. He began to realize that <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian's</a> party had not profited at all by the pagan deities, whom they had sought to propitiate; but that his own father Constantius, who had renounced the various <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a> of the Greeks, had passed through life far more prosperously. In this state of uncertainty, as he was marching at the head of his troops, a preternatural vision, which transcends all description, appeared to him. In fact, about that part of the day when the sun after posing the meridian begins to decline towards the west, he saw a pillar of light in the heavens, in the form of a cross, on which were inscribed these words, <span class="sc">By This Conquer</span> .  The appearance of this sign struck the emperor with amazement and scarcely believing his own eyes, he asked those around him if they beheld the same spectacle; and as they unanimously declared that they did, the emperor's mind was strengthened by this divine and marvelous apparition. On the following night in his slumbers he saw Christ who directed him to prepare a standard according to the pattern of that which had been seen; and to use it against his enemies as an assured trophy of victory. In <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to this divine oracle, he caused a standard in the form of a cross to be prepared, which is preserved in the palace even to the present time: and proceeding in his measures with greater earnestness, he attacked the enemy and vanquished him before the gates of Rome, near the Mulvian bridge, Maxentius himself being drowned in the river. This victory was achieved in the seventh year of the conqueror's reign.  After this, while Licinius, who shared the government with him, and was his brother-in-law, having married his sister Constantia, was residing in the East, the emperor Constantine, in view of the great blessing he had received, offered grateful thanksgivings to God as his benefactor; these consisted in his relieving the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, recalling those who were in exile, liberating such as were imprisoned, and causing the confiscated property of the prescribed to be restored to them; he moreover rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and performed all these things with the greatest ardor. About this time <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, who had abdicated the imperial authority, died at Salona in Dalmatia.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 3. While Constantine favors the Christians, Licinius, his Colleague, persecutes them.</h2>

<p>Now Constantine, the emperor, having thus embraced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, conducted himself as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> of his profession, rebuilding the churches, and enriching them with splendid offerings: he also either closed or destroyed the temples of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>,  and exposed the images which were in them to popular contempt. But his colleague Licinius, holding his pagan tenets, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; and although from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the emperor Constantine he avoided exciting open <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, yet he managed to plot against them covertly, and at length proceeded to harass them without disguise. This <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, however, was local, extending only to those districts where Licinius himself was: but as these and other public outrages did not long remain concealed from Constantine, finding out that the latter was indignant at his conduct, Licinius had recourse to an apology. Having thus propitiated him, he entered into a feigned league of friendship, pledging himself by many oaths not to act again tyrannically. But no sooner did he pledge himself than he committed <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>; for he neither changed his tyrannical mood nor ceased <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Indeed, he even prohibited the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by law from visiting the uncoverted <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, lest it should be made a pretext for proselyting them to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was thus at the same time well known and secret. It was conceded in name but manifest in fact; for those who were exposed to his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> suffered most severely both in their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and property.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 4. War arises between Constantine and Licinius on Account of the Christians.</h2>

<p>By this course he drew upon himself the emperor Constantine's heaviest displeasure; and they became enemies, the pretended treaty of friendship between them having been violated. Not long afterwards they took up arms against each other as declared enemies. And after several engagements both by sea and land, Licinius was at last utterly defeated near Chrysopolis in Bithynia, a port of the Chalcedonians, and surrendered himself to Constantine. Accordingly he having taken him alive, treated him with the utmost humanity, and would by no means put him to death, but ordered him to  take up his abode and live in tranquillity at Thessalonica. He having, however, remained quiet a short time, managed afterwards to collect some barbarian mercenaries and made an effort to repair his late disaster by a fresh appeal to arms. The emperor being made acquainted with his proceedings, directed that he should be slain, which was carried into effect. Constantine thus became possessed of the sole dominion, and was accordingly proclaimed sovereign Autocrat,  and again sought to promote the welfare of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. This he did in a variety of ways, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> enjoyed unbroken peace by reason of his efforts. But an internal dissension soon succeeded this state of repose, the nature and origin of which I shall now endeavor to describe.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The Dispute of Arius with Alexander, his Bishop.</h2>

<p>After Peter, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, had suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, Achillas was installed in the episcopal office, whom Alexander succeeded, during the period of peace above referred to. He, in the fearless exercise of his functions for the instruction and government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, attempted one day in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a> and the rest of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, to explain, with perhaps too <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> minuteness, that great theological <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>&mdash; <em>the</em> Unity <em>of the Holy Trinity.</em> A certain one of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> under his jurisdiction, whose name was <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, possessed of no inconsiderable <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> acumen, imaging that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was subtly teaching the same view of this subject as Sabellius the Libyan,  from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of controversy took the opposite opinion to that of the Libyan, and as he thought vigorously responded to what was said by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. 'If,' said he, 'the Father begot the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, he that was begotten had a beginning of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>: and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the Son was not. It therefore necessarily follows, that he had his substance  from nothing.'<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Division begins in the Church from this Controversy; and Alexander Bishop of Alexandria excommunicates Arius and his Adherents.</h2>

<p>Having drawn this inference from his novel train of reasoning, he excited many to a consideration of the question; and thus from a little spark a large fire was kindled: for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which began in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Alexandria, ran throughout all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Libya, and the upper Thebes, and at length diffused itself over the rest of the provinces and cities. Many others also adopted the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>; but Eusebius in particular was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> defender of it: not he of C&aelig;sarea, but the one who had before been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church at Berytus, and was then somehow in possession of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> in Bithynia. When Alexander became conscious of these things, both from his own observation and from report, being exasperated to the highest degree, he convened a council of many prelates; and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and the abettors of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; at the same time he wrote as follows to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> constituted in the several cities:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p> <em>The Epistle of Alexander Bishop of Alexandria.</em></p>

<p>To our beloved and most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> fellow-Ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> everywhere, Alexander sends greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is one body, and we are commanded in the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> to maintain 'the bond of unity and peace,' <span class="stiki" id="note260121"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;4:3</a></span> it becomes us to write, and mutually acquaint one another with the condition of things among each of us, in order that 'if one member suffers or rejoices, we may either sympathize with each other, or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> together.' <span class="stiki" id="note260122"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:26</a></span> Know therefore that there have recently arisen in our diocese lawless and anti-christian men, teaching <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> such as one may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> consider and denominate the forerunner of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. I wished indeed to consign this disorder to silence, that if possible the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> might be confined to the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> alone, and not go forth into other districts and contaminate the ears of some of the simple. But since Eusebius, now in <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, thinks that the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are under his control because, forsooth, he deserted his charge at Berytus and assumed authority over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> with impunity, and has put himself at the head of these <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>, daring even to send commendatory letters in all directions concerning them, if by any means he might inveigle some of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> into this most impious and anti-christian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, I felt imperatively called  on to be silent no longer, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what is written in the law, but to inform you of all of these things, that you might understand both who the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> are, and also the contemptible character of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and pay no attention to anything that Eusebius should write to you. For now wishing to renew his former malevolence, which seemed to have been buried in oblivion by time, he affects to write in their behalf; while the fact itself plainly shows that he does this for the promotion of his own purposes. These then are those who have become <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>: <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, Achillas, Aithales, and Carpones, another <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, Sarmates, Euzo&iuml;us, Lucius, Julian, Menas, Helladis, and Gaius; with these also must be reckoned Secundus and Theonas, who once were called <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> they have invented and assert, contrary to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, are these: That God was not always the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but that there was a period when he was not the Father; that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was not from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but was made out of nothing;  for that the ever-existing God ('the I AM'&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> One) made him who did not previously exist, out of nothing; wherefore there was a time when he did not exist, inasmuch as the Son is a creature and a work. That he is neither like the Father as it regards his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, nor is by nature either the Father's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Word, or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Wisdom, but indeed one of his works and creatures, being erroneously called Word and Wisdom, since he was himself made of God's own Word and the Wisdom which is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby God both made all things and him also. Wherefore he is as to his nature mutable and susceptible of change, as all other rational creatures are: hence the Word is alien to and other than the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the Father is inexplicable by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and invisible to him, for neither does the Word perfectly and accurately <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, neither can he distinctly see him. The Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: for he was made on our account, in order that God might create us by him, as by an instrument; nor would he ever have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, unless God had wished to create us.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some one accordingly asked them whether the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> could be changed, as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has been? And they feared not to say, 'Yes, he could; for being begotten, he is susceptible of change.' We then, with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Libya, being assembled together to the number of nearly a hundred, have <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> for his shameless avowal of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, together with all such as have countenanced them. Yet the partisans of Eusebius have received them; endeavoring to blend <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that which is impious with what is sacred. But they shall not prevail, for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must triumph; and 'light has no fellowship with darkness, nor has Christ any concord with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note260124"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> Who ever heard such <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>? Or what man of any <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is there now hearing them that is not horror-struck, and stops his ears, lest the filth of these expressions should pollute his sense of hearing? Who that hears John saying, 'In the beginning was the Word,'  does not condemn those that say, 'There was a period when the Word was not'? Or who, hearing in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of 'the only-begotten Son,' and that 'all things were made by him,' will not abhor those that pronounce the Son to be one of the things made? How can he be one of the things which were made by himself? Or how can he be the only-begotten, if he is reckoned among <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things? And how could he have had his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from nonentities, since the Father has said, 'My heart has indited a good matter';  and 'I begot you out of my bosom before the dawn'?  Or how is he unlike the Father's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, who is 'his perfect image,' <span class="stiki" id="note260128"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;1:15</a></span> and 'the brightness of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>' <span class="stiki" id="note260129"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews&nbsp;1:3</a></span> and says: 'He that has seen me, has seen the Father?'? Again how if the Son is the Word and Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was there a period when he did not exist? For that is equivalent to their saying that God was once destitute both of Word and Wisdom. How can he be mutable and susceptible of change, who says of himself, 'I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in me'; <span class="stiki" id="note260130"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;14:10</a></span> and 'I and the Father are one'; <span class="stiki" id="note260131"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> and again by the Prophet, <span class="stiki" id="note260132"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse6">Malachi&nbsp;3:6</a></span> 'Behold me because I am, and have not changed'? But if any one may also apply the expression to the Father himself, yet would it now be even more fitly said of the Word; because he was not changed by having become man, but as the Apostle says, <span class="stiki" id="note260133"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse8">Hebrews&nbsp;13:8</a></span> '<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the same yesterday, today, and forever.' But what could persuade them to say that he was made on our account, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has expressly declared <span class="stiki" id="note260134"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse10">Hebrews&nbsp;2:10</a></span> that 'all things are for him, and by him'? One need not wonder indeed at their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> assertion that the Son does not perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father; for having once determined to fight against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they reject even the words of the Lord himself, when he says, <span class="stiki" id="note260135"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;10:15</a></span> 'As the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> me, even so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I the Father.' If therefore the Father but partially <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, it is manifest that the Son also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father but in part. But if it would be improper to affirm this, and it be admitted that the Father perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the  Son, it is evident that as the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his own Word, so also does the Word <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his own Father, whose Word he is. And we, by stating these things, and unfolding the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, have often confuted them: but again as chameleons they were changed, striving to apply to themselves that which is written, 'When the ungodly has reached the depths of iniquity, he becomes contemptuous.'  Many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> have arisen before these, which exceeding all bounds in daring, have lapsed into complete infatuation: but these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, by attempting in all their discourses to subvert the Divinity of The Word, as having made a nearer approach to <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, have comparatively lessened the odium of former ones. Wherefore they have been publicly repudiated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>. We are indeed grieved on account of the perdition of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and especially so because, after having been previously instructed in the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they have now <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> from them. Nevertheless we are not greatly surprised at this, for Hymen&aelig;us and Philetus <span class="stiki" id="note260137"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:17-18</a></span> fell in like manner; and before them Judas, who had been a follower of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, but afterwards deserted him and became his betrayer. Nor were we without forewarning respecting these very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: for the Lord himself said: 'Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ: and shall many deceive many'; <span class="stiki" id="note260138"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;24:4</a></span> and 'the time is at hand; Go ye not therefore after them.' <span class="stiki" id="note260139"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;21:8</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, having learned these things from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, wrote, 'That in the latter times some should <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, giving heed to deceiving spirits, and doctrines of devils,'  who pervert the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Seeing then that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> has himself enjoined this, and has also by the apostle given us intimation respecting such men, we having ourselves heard their impiety have in consequence <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> them, as we before said, and declared them to be alienated from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Moreover we have intimated this to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, beloved and most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> fellow-ministers, in order that you might neither receive any of them, if they should presume to come to you, nor be induced to put confidence in Eusebius, or any other who may write to you about them. For it is incumbent on us who are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, to turn away from all those who speak or entertain a thought against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as from those who are resisting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are destroyers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men: neither does it become us even 'to salute such men,'  as the blessed John has prohibited, 'lest we should at any time be made partakers of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.' Greet the brethren which are with you; those who are with me salute you.<br> <br></p>

<p>Upon Alexander's thus addressing the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in every city, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> only became worse, inasmuch as those to whom he made this communication were thereby excited to contention. And some indeed fully concurred in and subscribed to the sentiments expressed in this letter, while others did the reverse. But Eusebius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, was beyond all others moved to controversy, inasmuch as Alexander in his letter had made a personal and censorious allusion to him. Now at this juncture Eusebius possessed great influence, because the emperor resided at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>. For in fact <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> had a short time previously built a palace there. On this account therefore many of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> paid their court to Eusebius. And he repeatedly wrote both to Alexander, that he might set aside the discussion which had been excited, and again receive <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his adherents into communion; and also to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in each city, that they might not concur in the proceedings of Alexander. By these means confusion everywhere prevailed: for one saw not only the prelates of the churches engaged in disputing, but the people also divided, some siding with one party, and some with the other. To so disgraceful an extent was this affair carried, that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> became a subject of popular ridicule, even in the very theatres. Those who were at Alexandria sharply disputed about the highest points of doctrine, and sent deputations to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; while those who were of the opposite faction created a similar disturbance.</p>

<p>With the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> the Melitians mingled themselves, who a little while before had been separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: but who these [Melitians] are must now be stated.</p>

<p>By Peter, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, who in the reign of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, a certain Melitius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of one of the cities in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in consequence of many other charges, and more especially because during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> he had denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, was deposed. This person, being stripped of his dignity, and having nevertheless many followers, became the leader of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of those who are to this day called from him Melitians throughout <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And as he had no rational excuse for his separation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he pretended that he had simply been wronged and loaded Peter with <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> reproaches. Now Peter died the death of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and so Melitius transferred his abuse first to Achillas, who succeeded Peter in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>, and afterwards again to Alexan  der, the successor of Achillas. In this state of things among them, the discussion in relation to <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> arose; and Melitius with his adherents took part with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>,  entering into a conspiracy with him against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But as many as regarded the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> as untenable, justified Alexander's decision against him, and thought that those who favored his views were <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemned. Meanwhile Eusebius of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> and his partisans, with such as favored the sentiments of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, demanded by letter that the sentence of excommunication which had been pronounced against him should be rescinded; and that those who had been excluded should be readmitted into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as they held no unsound doctrine. Thus letters from the opposite parties were sent to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria; and <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> made a collection of those which were favorable to himself while Alexander did the same with those which were adverse. This therefore afforded a plausible opportunity of defense to the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, which are now prevalent, of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, Eunomians, and such as receive their name from Macedonius; for these severally make use of these epistles in vindication of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Emperor Constantine being grieved at the Disturbance of the Churches, sends Hosius the Spaniard to Alexandria, exhorting the Bishop and Ariusto Reconciliation and Unity.</h2>

<p>When the emperor was made acquainted with these disorders, he was very deeply grieved; and regarding the matter as a personal misfortune, immediately exerted himself to extinguish the conflagration which had been kindled, and sent a letter to Alexander and <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> by a trustworthy person named Hosius, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Cordova, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The emperor greatly loved this man and held him in the highest estimation. It will not be out of place to introduce here a portion of this letter, the whole of which is given in the life of Constantine by Eusebius. </p>

<blockquote><p> <em>Victor Constantine Maximum Augustus to Alexander and <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>.</em></p>

<p>I am informed that your present controversy originated thus. When you, Alexander, inquired of your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> what each thought on a certain inexplicable passage of the written Word, rather on a subject improper for discussion; and you, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, rashly gave expression to a view of the matter such as ought either never to have been conceived, or when suggested to your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it became you to bury it in silence. This dispute having thus been excited among you, communion  has been denied; and the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people being rent into two factions, have departed from the harmony of the common body. Wherefore let each one of you, showing consideration for the other, listen to the impartial exhortation of your fellow-servant. And what counsel does he offer? It was neither <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> at first to agitate such a question, nor to reply to such a question when proposed: for the claim of no law demands the investigation of such subjects, but the idle useless talk of leisure occasions them. And even if they should exist for the sake of exercising our natural faculties, yet we ought to confine them to our own consideration, and not incautiously bring them forth in public assemblies, nor thoughtlessly confide them to the ears of everybody. Indeed how few are capable either of adequately expounding, or even accurately understanding the import of matters so vast and profound!<br> <br></p>

<p>And even if any one should be considered able to satisfactorily accomplish this, how large a portion of the people would he succeed in convincing? Or who can grapple with the subtlies of such investigations without danger of lapsing into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>? It becomes us therefore on such topics to check loquacity, lest either on account of the weakness of our nature we should be incompetent to explain the subject proposed; or the dull understanding of the audience should make them unable to apprehend clearly what is attempted to be taught: and in the case of one or the other of these failures, the people must be necessarily involved either in <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Wherefore let an unguarded question, and an inconsiderate answer, on the part of each of you, procure equal forgiveness from one another. No <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of difference has been started by you bearing on any important precept contained in the Law; nor has any new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> been introduced by you in connection with the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but you both hold one and the same judgment on these points, which is the Creed.  Moreover, while you thus pertinaciously contend with one another about matters of small or scarcely the least importance, it is unsuitable for you to have charge of so many people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because you are divided in opinion:  and not only is it unbe  coming, but it is also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be altogether unlawful.</p></blockquote>

<p>In order to remind you of your duty by an example of an inferior kind, I may say: you are well aware that even the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> themselves are united under one <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. Yet they often differ from each other on some parts of their theories: but although they may differ on the very highest branches of science, in order to maintain the unity of their body, they still agree to coalesce. Now, if this is done among them, how much more equitable will it be for you, who have been constituted ministers of the Most High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to become unanimous with one another in such a religious profession. But let us examine with closer consideration, and deeper attention, what has been already stated. Is it right on account of insignificant and vain contentions between you about words, that brethren should be set in opposition against brethren; and that the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> communion should be distracted by unhallowed dissension, through our striving with one another respecting things so unimportant, and by no means essential? These quarrels are vulgar and rather consistent with puerile thoughtlessness, than suitable to the intelligence of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> men. We should spontaneously turn aside from the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. The great God and Saviour of us all has extended to all the common light. Under his <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, allow me, his servant, to bring this effort of mine to a successful issue; that by my exhortation, ministry, and earnest admonition, I may lead you, his people, back to unity of communion.  For since, as I have said, there is but one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among you, and one sentiment respecting religion,  and since the precept of the law,  in all its parts, combines all in one purpose of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, let not this diversity of opinion, which has excited dissension among you, by any means <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> discord and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, inasmuch as it does not affect the force of the law as a whole. Now, I say these things, not as compelling you all to see exactly alike on this very insignificant subject of controversy, whatever it may be; since the dignity  of the communion may be preserved unaffected, and the same fellowship with all be retained, even though there should exist among you some dissimilarity of sentiment on unimportant matters. For, of course, we do not all desire the same thing in every respect; nor is there one unvarying nature, or standard of judgment in us. Therefore, in regard to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, let there be one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one sentiment, and one covenant of the Godhead:  but those minute investigations which you enter into among yourselves with so much nicety, even if you should not concur in one judgment in regard to them, should remain within the sphere of your own reflection, kept in the secret recesses of the mind. Let then an ineffable and select bond of general friendship, with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a devout observance of his law, remain unshaken among you. Resume mutual friendship and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; restore to the whole people their accustomed familiar embraces; and do ye yourselves, on the strength of having purified your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, again recognize one another. For friendship often becomes sweeter after the removal of animosity. Thus restore to me tranquil days, and nights free from care; that to me also some pleasure in the pure light may be preserved, and a cheerful serenity during the rest of my life: otherwise, I must necessarily groan, and be wholly suffused with tears; neither will the remaining period of my earthly <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> be peacefully sustained. For while the people of God (I speak of my fellow-servants) are severed from one another by so unworthy and injurious a contest, how is it possible for me to maintain my usual equanimity? But in order that you may have some idea of my excessive grief on account of this unhappy difference, listen to what I am about to state. On my recent arrival at the city of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, it was my intention immediately after to proceed into the East: but while I was hastening toward you, and had advanced a considerable distance on my way, intelligence of this affair altogether reversed my purpose, lest I should be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to see with my own eyes a condition of things such as I could scarcely bear the report of. Open to me therefore by your reconciliation henceforth, the way into the East, which you have obstructed by your contentions against one another: and permit me speedily to behold both you and all the rest of the people rejoicing together; and to express my due thanks to the Divine Being, because of the general harmony and liberty of all parties, accompanied by the cordial utterance of your praise.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Of the Synod which was held at Nic&aelig;a in Bithynia, and the Creed there  put forth.</h2>

<p>Such admirable and wise counsel did the emperor's letter contain. But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> had become too strong both for the exhortations of the emperor, and the authority of him who was the bearer of his letter: for neither was Alexander nor <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> softened by this appeal; and moreover there was incessant strife and tumult among the people. Moreover another local source of disquietude had pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> there, which served to trouble the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>&mdash;the dispute namely in regard to the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, which was carried on in the regions of the East only.  This arose from some desiring to keep the Feast more in accordance with the custom of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; while others preferred its mode of celebration by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in general throughout the world. This difference, however, did not interfere with their communion, although their mutual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> was necessarily hindered. When, therefore, the emperor beheld the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> agitated on account of both of these causes, he convoked a General Council,  summoning all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by letter to meet him at Nic&aelig;a in Bithynia. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled out of the various provinces and cities; respecting whom <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius Pamphilus</a> thus writes, word for word, in his third book of the life of Constantine:  <br><br></p>

<p>'Wherefore the most eminent of the ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all the churches which have filled <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, Africa, and Asia, were convened. And one sacred edifice, dilated as it were by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, contained within it on the same occasion both Syrians and Cilicians, Ph&oelig;nicians, Arabs and Palestinians, and in addition to these, Egyptians, Thebans, Libyans, and those who came from Mesopotamia. At this synod a Persian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was also present, neither was the Scythian absent from this assemblage. <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> also and Galatia, Pamphylia, Cappadocia, Asia and Phrygia, supplied those who were most distinguished among them. Besides, there met there Thracians and Macedonians, Achaians and Epirots, and even those who dwelt still further away than these, and the most celebrated of the Spaniards himself  took his seat among the rest. The prelate  of the imperial city was absent on account of age; but some of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> were present and filled his place. Such a crown, composed as a bond of peace, the emperor Constantine alone has ever dedicated to Christ his Saviour, as a thank-offering worthy of God for victory over his enemies, having appointed this convocation among us in imitation of the Apostolic Assembly. <span class="stiki" id="note260159"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse5">Acts&nbsp;2:5-11</a></span> For among them it is said were convened <q>devout men of every nation under heaven; Parthians, Medes and Elamites, and those who dwelt in Mesopotamia, Jud&aelig;a and Cappadocia, <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the part of Libya which is toward Cyrene, strangers from Rome also, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and proselytes with Cretans and Arabs.</q> That congregation, however, was inferior in this respect, that all present were not ministers of God: whereas in this assembly the number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> exceeded three hundred;  while the number of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and acolyths  and others who attended them was almost incalculable. Some of these ministers of God were eminent for their wisdom, some for the strictness of their life, and patient endurance [of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>], and others united in themselves all these distinguished characteristics: some were venerable from their advanced age, others were conspicuous for their youth and vigor of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and others had but recently entered on their ministerial career.  For all these the emperor appointed an abundant supply of daily food to be provided.'<br> <br></p>

<p>Such is Eusebius' account of those who met on this occasion. The emperor having completed the festal solemnization of this triumph over Licinius, came also in person to Nice.</p>

<p>There were among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> two of extraordinary celebrity, Paphnutius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Upper Thebes, and Spyridon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>: why I have so particular referred to these two individuals, I shall state hereafter. Many of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were also present, who were practiced in the art of reasoning,  and each eager to advocate the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his own party. Eusebius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, as was before said, sup  ported the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, together with Theognis and Maris; of these the former was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nic&aelig;a, and Maris of Chalcedon in Bithynia. These were powerfully opposed by Athanasius, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> church, who was highly esteemed by Alexander his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and on that account was much envied, as will be seen hereafter. Now a short time previous to the general assembling of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the disputants engaged in preparatory <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> contests before the multitudes; and when many were attracted by the interest of their discourse, one of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, <em>a confessor</em> , who was a man of unsophisticated understanding, reproved these reasoners, telling them that Christ and his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did not teach us dialectics, art, nor vain subtlies, but simple-mindedness, which is preserved by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and good works. As he said this, all present admired the speaker and assented to the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of his remarks; and the disputants themselves, after hearing his plain statement of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, exercised a greater degree of moderation: thus then was the disturbance caused by these <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> debates suppressed at this time.<br> <br></p>

<p>On the following day all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were assembled together in one place; the emperor arrived soon after and on his entrance stood in their midst, and would not take his place, until the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by bowing intimated their desire that he should be seated: such was the respect and reverence which the emperor entertained for these men. When a silence suitable to the occasion had been observed, the emperor from his seat began to address them words of exhortation to harmony and unity, and entreated each to lay aside all private pique. For several of them had brought accusations against one another and many had even presented petitions to the emperor the day before. But he, directing their attention to the matter before them, and on account of which they were assembled, ordered these petitions to be burnt; merely observing that 'Christ enjoins him who is anxious to obtain forgiveness, to forgive his brother.' When therefore he had strongly insisted on the maintenance of harmony and peace, he sanctioned again their purpose of more closely investigating the questions at issue. But it may be well to hear what Eusebius says on this subject, in his third book of the Life of Constantine.  His words are these:<br> <br></p>

<p>'A variety of topics having been introduced by each party and much controversy being excited from the very commencement, the emperor listened to all with patient attention, deliberately and impartially considering whatever was advanced. He in part supported the statements which were made on either side, and gradually softened the asperity of those who contentiously opposed each other, conciliating each by his mildness and affability. And as he addressed them in the Greek language, for he was not unacquainted with it, he was at once interesting and persuasive, and wrought conviction on the minds of some, and prevailed on others by entreaty, those who spoke well he applauded. And inciting all to unanimity at length he succeeded in bringing them into similarity of judgment, and conformity of opinion on all the controverted points: so that there was not only unity in the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but also a general agreement as to the time for the celebration of the feast of Salvation.  Moreover the doctrines which had thus the common consent, were confirmed by the signature of each individual.'<br> <br></p>

<p>Such in his own words is the testimony respecting these things which Eusebius has left us in writing; and we not unfitly have used it, but treating what he has said as an authority, have introduced it here for the fidelity of this history. With this end also in view, that if any one should condemn as erroneous the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> professed at this council of Nic&aelig;a, we might be unaffected by it, and put no confidence in Sabinus the Macedonian,  who calls all those who were convened there ignoramuses and simpletons. For this Sabinus, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Macedonians at Heraclea in Thrace, having made a collection of the decrees published by various Synods of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, has treated those who composed the Nicene Council in particular with contempt and derision; not perceiving that he thereby charges Eusebius himself with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, who made a like confession after the closest scrutiny. And in fact some things he has willfully passed over, others he has perverted, and on all he has put a construction favorable to his own views. Yet he commends <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius Pamphilus</a> as a trustworthy <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and praises the emperor as capable in stating <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrines: but he still brands the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was declared at Nic&aelig;a, as having been set forth by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and such as had no intelligence in the matter. And thus he voluntarily contemns the words of a man whom he himself pronounces a wise and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>: for Eusebius declares, that of the ministers of God who were present at the Nicene Synod, some were eminent for the word of wisdom, others for the strictness of their life; and that the emperor himself being present, leading all into unanimity, established unity of judgment, and agreement of opinion among them. Of Sabinus, however, we shall make further mention as occasion may require. But the agreement of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, assented to with loud acclamation at the great council of Nic&aelig;a is this:<br> <br></p>

<blockquote><p>'We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible:&mdash; and in one  Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the only-begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that is of the substance of the Father; God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Light of light; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; begotten, not made, consubstantial  with the Father: by whom all things were made, both which are in heaven and on earth: who for the sake of us men, and on account of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, descended, became incarnate, and was made man; suffered, arose again the third day, and ascended into the heavens, and will come again to judge the living and the dead. [We] also [<a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>] in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic church <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a> those who say <q>There was a time when he was not,</q> and <q>He was not before he was begotten</q> and <q>He was made from that which did not exist,</q> and those who assert that he is of other substance or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or that he was created, or is susceptible of change.'  <br></p></blockquote>

<p>This creed was recognized and acquiesced in by three hundred and eighteen [<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>]; and being, as Eusebius says, unanimous is expression and sentiment, they subscribed it. Five only would not receive it, objecting to the term <em>homoousios</em>, 'of the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>,' or <em>consubstantial:</em> these were Eusebius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, Theognis of Nice, Maris of Chalcedon, Theonas of Marmarica, and Secundus of Ptolema&iuml;s. 'For,' said they 'since that is <em>consubstantial</em> which is from another either by partition, derivation or germination; by germination, as a shoot from the roots; by derivation, as children from their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; by division, as two or three vessels of gold from a mass, and the Son is from the Father by none of these modes: therefore they declared themselves unable to assent to this creed.' Thus having scoffed at the word <em>consubstantial</em>, they would not subscribe to the deposition of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>. Upon this the Synod <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and all who adhered to his opinions, prohibiting him at the same time from entering into Alexandria. At the same time an edict of the emperor sent <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> himself into exile, together with Eusebius and Theognis and their followers; Eusebius and Theognis, however, a short time after their banishment, tendered a written declaration of their change of sentiment, and concurrence in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <em>consubstantiality</em> of the Son with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as we shall show as we proceed.</p>

<p>At this time during the session of the Synod, Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">C&aelig;sarea in Palestine</a>, who had held aloof for a short time, after mature consideration whether he ought to receive this definition of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, at length acquiesced in it, and subscribed it with all the rest: he also sent to the people under his charge a copy of the Creed, with an explanation of the word <em>homoousios</em>, that no one might impugn his motives on account of his previous hesitation. Now what was written by Eusebius was as follows in his own words:</p>

<p>'You have probably had some intimation, beloved, of the transactions of the great council convened at Nic&aelig;a, in relation to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, inasmuch as rumor generally outruns <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> account of that which has really taken place. But lest from such report alone you might form an incorrect estimate of the matter, we have deemed it necessary to submit to you, in the first place, an exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> proposed by us in written form; and then a second which has been promulgated, consisting of ours with certain additions to its expression. The declaration of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> set forth by us, which when read in the presence of our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor, seemed to meet with universal approbation, was thus expressed:</p>

<p>'According as we received from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who preceded us, both in our instruction  [in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>], and when we were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; as also we have ourselves learned from the sacred Scriptures: and in accordance with what we have both <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and taught while discharging the duties of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and the episcopal office itself, so now we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and present to you the distinct avowal of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It is this:<br> <br></p>

<p>'<q>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible:&mdash; and in one Lord, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Light of light, Life of life, the only-begotten Son, born before all creation,  begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, before all ages, by whom also all things were made; who on account of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> became incarnate, and lived among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and who suffered and rose again on the third day, and ascended to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and shall come again in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to judge the living and the dead. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and subsistence of each of these [<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>]: that the Father is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Father, the Son <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Son, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; even as our Lord also, when he sent forth his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, said,  'Go and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.' Concerning these doctrines we steadfastly maintain their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and avow our full confidence in them; such also have been our sentiments hitherto, and such we shall continue to hold until death and in an unshaken adherence to this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> every impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. In the presence of God Almighty, and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> we testify, that thus we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and thought from our heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since we have possessed a right estimate of ourselves; and that we now think and speak what is perfectly in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. We are moreover prepared to prove to you by undeniable evidences, and to convince you that in time past we have thus <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and so preached.</q><br> <br></p>

<p>'When these articles of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were proposed, there seemed to be no ground of opposition: nay, our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor himself was the first to admit that they were perfectly correct, and that he himself had entertained the sentiments contained in them; exhorting all present to give them their assent, and subscribe to these very articles, thus agreeing in a unanimous profession of them, with the insertion, however, of that single word <q> <em>homoousios</em></q> (consubstantial), an expression which the emperor himself explained, as not indicating corporeal affections or properties; and consequently that the Son did not subsist from the Father either by division or abscission: for said he, a nature which is immaterial and incorporeal cannot possibly be subject to any corporeal affection; hence our conception of such things can only be in divine and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> terms. Such was the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> view of the subject taken by our most wise and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sovereign; and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on account of the word <em>homoousious</em>, drew up this formula of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p> <em>The Creed.</em> </p>

<p>'<q>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible:&mdash; and in one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the only-begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that is of the substance of the Father; God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Light of light, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father; by  whom all things were made both which are in heaven and on earth; who for the sake of us men, and on account of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, descended, became incarnate, was made man, suffered and rose again on the third day; he ascended into the heavens, and will come to judge the living and the dead. [We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>] also in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But those who say 'There was a time when he was not,' or 'He did not exist before he was begotten,' or 'He was made of nothing' or assert that 'He is of other substance or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,' or that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is created, or mutable, or susceptible of change, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and apostolic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a>.</q><br> <br></p>

<p>'Now this declaration of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> being propounded by them, we did not neglect to investigate the distinct sense of the expressions <q>of the substance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and consubstantial with the Father.</q> Whereupon questions were put forth and answers, and the meaning of these terms was clearly defined; when it was generally admitted that <em>ousias</em> (of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or substance) simply implied that the Son is of the Father indeed, but does not subsist as a part of the Father. To this interpretation of the sacred doctrine which declares that the Son is of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but is not a part of his substance, it seemed right to us to assent. We ourselves therefore concurred in this exposition; nor do we cavil at the word <q> <em>homoousios</em></q> having regard to peace, and fearing to lose a right understanding of the matter. On the same grounds we admitted also the expression <q>begotten, not made</q>: <q>for <em>made</em>,</q> said they, <q>is a term applicable in common to all the creatures which were made by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, to whom the Son has no resemblance. Consequently he is no creature like those which were made by him, but is of a substance far excelling any creature; which substance the Divine Oracles teach was begotten of the Father by such a mode of generation as cannot be explained nor even conceived by any creature.</q> Thus also the declaration that <q>the Son is consubstantial with the Father</q> having been discussed, it was agreed that this must not be understood in a corporeal sense, or in any way analogous to mortal creatures; inasmuch as it is neither by division of substance, nor by abscission nor by any change of the Father's substance and power, since the underived nature of the Father is inconsistent with all these things. That he is consubstantial with the Father then simply implies, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has no resemblance to <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, but is in every respect like the Father only who begot him; and that he is of no other substance or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> but of the Father. To which doctrine, explained in this way, it appeared right to assent, especially since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that some eminent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and learned writers among the ancients have used the term <q> <em>homoousios</em></q> in their theological discourses concerning the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Such is what I have to state to you in reference to the articles of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which have been promulgated; and in which we have all concurred, not without due examination, but according to the senses assigned, which were investigated in the presence of our most highly favored emperor, and for the reasons mentioned approved. We have also considered the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> pronounced by them after the declaration of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> inoffensive; because it prohibits the use of illegitimate  terms, from which almost all the distraction and commotion of the churches have arisen. Accordingly, since no divinely inspired Scripture contains the expressions, <q>of things which do not exist,</q> and <q>there was a time when he was not,</q> and such other phrases as are therein subjoined, it seemed unwarrantable to utter and teach them: and moreover this decision received our sanction the rather from the consideration that we have never heretofore been accustomed to employ these terms. We deemed it incumbent on us, beloved, to acquaint you with the caution which has characterized both our examination of and concurrence in these things: and that on justifiable grounds we resisted to the last moment the introduction of certain objectionable expressions as long as these were not acceptable; and received them without dispute, when on mature deliberation as we examined the sense of the words, they appeared to agree with what we had originally proposed as a sound confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.'<br> <br></p>

<p>Such was the letter addressed by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius Pamphilus</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">C&aelig;sarea in Palestine</a>. At the same time the Synod itself also, with one accord, wrote the following epistle to the church of the Alexandrians, and to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Libya, and Pentapolis.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The Letter of the Synod, relative to its Decisions: and the Condemnation of Arius and those who agreed with him.</h2>

<p>To the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and great church of the Alexandrians, and to our beloved brethren throughout <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Libya, and Pentapolis, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled at Nic&aelig;a, constituting the great and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod, send greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>Since, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a great and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod has been convened at Nic&aelig;a, our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sovereign Constantine having summoned us out of various cities and provinces for that purpose, it appeared to us indispensably necessary that a letter should be written to you on the part of the sacred Synod; in order that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what subjects were brought under consideration and examined, and what was eventually determined on and decreed.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, the impiety and guilt of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his adherents were examined into, in the presence of our most religious emperor Constantine: and it was unanimously decided that his impious opinion should be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, with all the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> expressions he has uttered, in affirming that 'the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> sprang from nothing,' and that 'there was a time when he was not'; saying moreover that 'the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, because possessed of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, was capable either of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and calling him a creature and a work. All these sentiments the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod has <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, having scarcely patience to endure the hearing of such an impious opinion, or, rather, <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and such <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> words. But the conclusion of our proceedings against him you must either have been informed of already or will soon learn; for we would not seem to trample on a man who has received the chastisement which his crime deserved. Yet so contagious has his pestilential <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, as to drag into perdition Theonas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Marmarica, and Secundus of Ptolema&iuml;s; for they have suffered the same condemnation as himself. But when the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God delivered us from those execrable <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, with all their impiety and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and from those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who had dared to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> discord and division among a people previously at peace, there still remained the contumacy of Melitius [to be dealt with] and those who had been ordained by him; and we now state to you, beloved brethren, what resolution the Synod came to on this point. It was decreed, the Synod being moved to great clemency towards Melitius, although strictly speaking he was wholly undeserving of favor, that he remain in his own city but exercise no authority either to ordain or nominate for ordination; and that he appear in no other district or city on this pretense, but simply retain a nominal dignity. That those who had received appointments from him, after having been confirmed by a more legitimate ordination, should be admitted to communion on these conditions: that they should continue to hold their rank and ministry, but regard themselves as inferior in every respect to all those who have been ordained and established in each place and church by our most-<a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> fellow-minister, Alexander, so that they shall have no authority to propose or nominate whom they please, or to do anything at all without the concurrence of some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who is one of Alexander's suffragans. On the other hand, such as by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> have been found in no <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, but have continued in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> blameless, shall have authority to nominate and ordain those who are worthy of the sacred office,  and to act in all things according to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> law and usage. When it may happen that any of those holding preferments in the church die, then let these who have been thus recently admitted be advanced to the dignity of the deceased, provided that they should appear worthy, and that the people should elect them, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria also ratifying their choice. This privilege is conceded to all the others indeed, but to Melitius personally we by no means grant the same license, on account of his former disorderly conduct, and because of the rashness and levity of his character, in order that no authority or jurisdiction should be given him as a man liable again to create similar disturbances. These are the things which specially affect <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> church of the Alexandrians: and if any other canon or ordinance has been established, our Lord and most-<a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> fellow-minister and brother Alexander being present with us, will on his return to you enter into more minute details, inasmuch as he has been a participator in whatever is transacted, and has had the principal direction of it. We have also gratifying intelligence to communicate to you relative to unity of judgment on the subject of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>: for this point also has been happily settled through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; so that all the brethren in the East who have heretofore kept this festival when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did, will henceforth conform to the Romans and to us, and to all who from the earliest time have observed our period of celebrating <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. Rejoicing therefore in these conclusions and in the general unanimity and peace, as well as in the extirpation of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, receive with the greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and more abundant <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our fellow-minister and your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Alexander, who has greatly delighted us by his presence, and even at his advanced age has undergone extraordinary exertions in order that peace might be re-established among you. Pray on behalf of us all, that the things decided as just may be inviolably maintained through Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.<br> <br></p>

<p>This epistle of the Synod makes it plain that they not only <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his adherents, but the very expressions of his tenets; and that having agreed among themselves respecting the celebration of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, they readmitted the heresiarch Melitius into communion, suffering him to retain his episcopal rank, but divesting him of all authority to act as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It is for this reason I suppose that even at the present time the Melitians in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> are separated from the church, because the Synod deprived Melitius of all power. It should be observed moreover that <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> had written a treatise on his own opinion which he entitled <em>Thalia;</em> but the character of the book is loose and dissolute, similar in its style and metres to the songs of Sotades.  This production also the Synod condemned at the same time. Nor was it the Synod alone that took the trouble to write letters to the churches announcing the restoration of peace, but the emperor Constantine himself also wrote personally and sent the following address to the church of the Alexandrians.<br> <br></p>

<blockquote><p> <em>The Emperor's Letter.</em></p>

<p>Constantine Augustus, to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church of the Alexandrians. Beloved brethren, hail! We have received from <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> the inestimable blessing of being relieved from all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and united in the acknowledgment of one and the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> will no longer have any power against us, since all that which he had malignantly devised for our destruction has been entirely overthrown from the foundations. The splendor of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has dissipated at the command of God those dissensions, schisms, tumults, and so to speak, deadly poisons of discord. Wherefore we all worship one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he is. But in order that this might be done, by divine admonition I assembled at the city of Nic&aelig;a most of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; with whom I myself also, who am but one of you, and who <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> exceedingly in being your fellow-servant, undertook the investigation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Accordingly, all points which seemed in consequence of ambiguity to furnish any pretext for dissension, have been discussed and accurately examined. And may the Divine Majesty pardon the fearful enormity of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> which some were shamelessly uttering concerning the mighty Saviour, our life and hope; declaring and confessing that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> things contrary to the divinely inspired Scriptures. While more than three hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> remarkable for their moderation and intellectual keenness, were unanimous in their confirmation of one and the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and legitimate construction of the law of God can only be <em>the</em> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> alone beguiled by the subtlety of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, was discovered to be the sole disseminator of this mischief, first among you, and afterwards with unhallowed purposes among others also. Let us therefore embrace that doctrine which the Almighty has presented to us: let us return to our beloved brethren from whom an irreverent servant of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has separated us: let us go with all speed to the common body and our own natural members. For this is becoming your penetration, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>; that since the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be due to him who is an enemy to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you should return to the divine favor. For that which has commended itself to the judgment of three hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cannot be other than the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; seeing that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> dwelling in the minds of so many dignified <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> has effectually enlightened them respecting the Divine will. Wherefore let no one vacillate or linger, but let all with alacrity return to the undoubted path of duty; that when I shall arrive among you, which will be as soon as possible, I may with you return due thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the inspector of all things, for having revealed the pure <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and restored to you that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for which you have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. May God protect you, beloved brethren.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus wrote the emperor to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Alexandria, assuring them that the exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was neither made rashly nor at random, but that it was dictated with much research, and after strict investigation: and not that some things were spoken of, while others were suppressed in silence; but that whatever could be fittingly advanced in support of any opinion was fully stated. That nothing indeed was precipitately determined, but all was previously discussed with minute accuracy; so that every point which seemed to furnish a pretext for ambiguity of meaning, or difference of opinion, was thoroughly sifted, and its difficulties removed. In short he terms the thought of all those who were assembled there the thought of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and does not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the unanimity of so many eminent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was effected by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Sabinus, however, the chief of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Macedonians, willfully rejects these authorities, and calls those who were convened there <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and illiterate <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; nay, he almost accuses Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea himself of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: nor does he reflect, that even if those who constituted that synod had been <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, yet as being illuminated by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, they were utterly unable to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.  Nevertheless, hear farther what the emperor decreed in another circular both against <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and those who held his opinions, sending it in all directions to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and people.</p>

<blockquote><p> <em>Another Epistle of Constantine.</em></p>

<p>Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and people.&mdash; Since <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> has imitated <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and impious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, it is just that he should undergo the like ignominy. Wherefore as Porphyry,  that enemy of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, for having composed licentious treatises against religion, found a suitable recompense, and such as thenceforth branded him with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, overwhelming him with deserved reproach, his impious writings also having been destroyed; so now it seems fit both that <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and such as hold his sentiments should be denominated Porphyrians, that they may take their appellation from those whose conduct they have imitated. And in addition to this, if any treatise composed by <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> should be discovered, let it be consigned to the flames, in order that not only his depraved doctrine may be suppressed, but also that no memorial of him may be by any means left. This therefore I decree, that if any one shall be detected in concealing a book compiled by <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and shall not instantly bring it forward and burn it, the penalty for this offense shall be death; for immediately after conviction the criminal shall suffer capital punishment. May God preserve you!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p> <em>Another Epistle.</em>  <br><br></p>

<p>Constantine Augustus, to the Churches.</p>

<p>Having experienced from the flourishing condition of public affairs, how great has been the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of divine power, I judged this to be an object above all things claiming my care, that one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with sincere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and uniform <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> toward <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> should be maintained among the most blessed assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But inasmuch as I perceived that this could not be firmly and permanently established, unless all, or at least the greatest part of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> could be convened in the same place, and every point of our most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion should be discussed by them in council; therefore as many as possible were assembled, and I myself also as one of you was present; for I will not deny what I especially <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in, that I am your fellow-servant. All points were then minutely investigated, until a decision acceptable to Him who is the inspector of all things, was published for the promotion of uniformity  of judgment and practice; so that nothing might be henceforth left for dissension or controversy in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. There also the question having been considered relative to the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, it was determined by common consent that it should be proper that all should celebrate it on one and the same day everywhere. For what can be more appropriate, or what more solemn, than that this feast from which we have received the hope of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, should be invariably kept in one order, and for an obvious reason among all? And in the first place, it seemed very unworthy of this most sacred feast, that we should keep it following the custom of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; a people who having imbrued their hands in a most heinous outrage, have thus polluted their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and are deservedly blind. Having then cast aside their usage, we are free to see to it that the celebration of this observance should occur in future in the more correct order which we have kept from the first day of the Passion until the present time. Therefore have nothing in common with that most hostile people the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. We have received from the Saviour another way; for there is set before us both a legitimate and accurate course in our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion: unanimously pursuing this, let us, most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> brethren, withdraw ourselves from that detestable association. For it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> absurd for them to boast that we are incapable of rightly observing these things without their instruction. For on what subject will they be competent to form a correct judgment, who after that <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of their Lord, having been bereft of their senses, are led not by any rational motive, but by an ungovernable impulse, wherever their innate fury may drive them? Thence it is therefore, that even in this particular they do not perceive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so that they constantly erring in the utmost degree, instead of making a suitable correction, celebrate the Feast of <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> a second time in the same year.  Why then should we follow the example of those who are acknowledged to be infected with grievous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>? Surely we should never suffer <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> to be kept twice in one and the same year! But even if these considerations were not laid before you, it became your <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> at all times to take heed, both by diligence and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that the purity of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should in nothing have communion, or seem to do so with the customs of men so utterly depraved. Moreover this should also be considered, that in a matter so important and of such religious significance, the slightest disagreement is most irreverent. For our Saviour left us but one day to be observed in commemoration of our deliverance, that is the day of his most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Passion: he also wished his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be one; the members of which, however much they may be scattered in various places, are notwithstanding cherished by one Spirit, that is by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> consistent with your sacred character consider how grievous and indecorous it is, that on the same days some should be observing <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, while others are celebrating feasts; and after the days of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> some should indulge in festivities and enjoyments, and others submit to appointed <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>. On this account therefore <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> directed that an appropriate correction should be effected, and uniformity of practice established, as I suppose you are all aware.<br> <br></p>

<p>Since then it was desirable that this should be so amended that we should have nothing in common with that nation of parricides, and of those who slew their Lord; and since the order is a becoming one which is observed by all the churches of the western, southern, and northern parts, and by some also in the eastern; from these considerations for the present all thought it to be proper, and I pledged myself that it would be satisfactory to your <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> penetration, that what is observed with such general unanimity of sentiment in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Africa, all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, France, Britain, Libya, the whole of Greece, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Asia, <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and Cilicia, your intelligence also would cheerfully accept; reflecting too that not only is there a greater number of churches in the places before mentioned, but also that this in particular is a most sacred obligation, that all should in common desire whatever strict reason seems to demand, and what has no communion with the <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But to sum up matters briefly, it was determined by common consent that the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> festival of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> should be solemnized on one and the same day; for it is not even seemly that there should be in such a hallowed <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> any difference: and it is more commendable to adopt that opinion in which there will be no intermixture of strange <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, or deviation from what is right. These things therefore being thus consistent, do you gladly receive this heavenly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine command: for whatever is done in the sacred assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is referable to the Divine will. Wherefore, when you have indicated the things which have been prescribed to all our beloved brethren, it behooves you to publish the above written statements and to accept the reasoning which has been adduced, and to establish this observance of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day: that when I arrive at the long and earnestly desired view of your order, I may be able to celebrate the sacred festival with you on one and the same day; and may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with you for all things, in seeing Satanic cruelty frustrated by divine power through our efforts, while your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, peace and concord are everywhere flourishing. May God preserve you, beloved brethren.</p></blockquote>

<p> <em>Another Epistle to Eusebius.</em>  <br><br></p>

<p>Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to Eusebius.</p>

<p>Since an impious purpose and tyranny have even to the present time <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the servants of God our Saviour, I have been credibly informed and am fully persuaded, most beloved brother, that all our sacred edifices have either by neglect gone to decay, or from dread of impending danger have not been adorned with becoming dignity. But now that liberty has been restored, and that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> dragon Licinius has by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of the Most High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and our instrumentality, been removed from the administration of public affairs, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the divine power has been made manifest to all, and at the same time that those who either through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or unbelief fell into any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, having acknowledged the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will come to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and right course of life. Wherefore enjoin the churches over which you yourself preside, as well as the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> presiding in various places, together with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, to be diligent about the sacred edifices, either by repairing those which remain standing, or enlarging them, or by erecting new ones wherever it may be requisite. And do you yourself ask, and the rest through you, the necessary supplies both from the governors of the provinces, and the officers of the pr&aelig;torian prefecture: for directions have been given to them to execute with all diligence the orders of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. May God preserve you, beloved brother.</p>

<p>These instructions, concerning the building of churches were sent by the emperor to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in every province: but what he wrote to Eusebius of Palestine respecting the preparation of some copies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, we may ascertain from the letters themselves:  <br><br></p>

<p>Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea.</p>

<p>In the city which derives its name from us, a very great multitude of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, through the assisting <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of our Saviour <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have united themselves to the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, so that it has received much increase there. It is therefore requisite that more churches should be furnished in that place: wherefore do you most cordially enter into the purpose which I have conceived. I have thought fit to intimate this to your <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, that you should order to be transcribed on well-prepared parchment, by competent writers accurately acquainted with their art, fifty copies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>, both legibly described, and of a portable size, the provision and use of which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be needful for the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Letters have also been dispatched from our clemency, to the financial agent  of the diocese that he be careful to provide all things necessary for the preparation of them. That these copies may be got ready as quickly as possible, let it be a task for your diligence: and you are authorized, on the warrant of this our letter, to use two of the public carriages for their conveyance; for thus the copies which are most satisfactorily transcribed, may be easily conveyed for our inspection, one of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of your church fulfilling this commission; who when he has reached us shall experience our bounty. May God preserve you, beloved brother.<br> <br></p>

<p> <em>Another Epistle to Macarius.</em>  <br><br></p>

<p>Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to Macarius of Jerusalem.&mdash; Such is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, that no supply of words seems to be adequate to the expression of its present manifestation. For that the monument  of his most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> passion, long since hidden under the earth, should have lain concealed for a period of so many years, until, through the destruction of the common enemy of all,  it should shine forth to his own servants after their having regained their freedom, exceeds all admiration. For if all those who throughout the whole habitable earth are accounted wise, should be convened in one and the same place, desiring to say something worthy of the event, they would fall infinitely short of the least part of it; for the apprehension of this wonder as far transcends every nature capable of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasoning, as heavenly things are mightier than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. Hence therefore this is always my special aim, that as the credibility of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> daily demonstrates itself by fresh <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of us all should become more diligent respecting the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> law, with modesty and unanimous eagerness. But I desire that you should be fully aware of what I conceive is pretty generally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, that it is now my chief care, that we should adorn with magnificent structures that hallowed spot, which by God's appointment I have disencumbered of a most disgraceful addition  of an idol, as of some grievous burden; which was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> indeed from the beginning in the purpose of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but has been more manifestly sanctified since he has brought to light the evidence of the Saviour's passion. Wherefore it is becoming your <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to make such arrangements, and provision of everything necessary, that not only a church  should be built in itself superior to any elsewhere, but that the rest of its parts also may be such that all the most splendid edifices in every city may be excelled by this. With regard to the workmanship and chaste execution of the walls, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we have entrusted the care of these things to our friend Dracilian, deputy to the most illustrious prefects of the pr&aelig;torium, and to the governor of the province: for my <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> has ordered that artificers and workmen, and whatever other things they may be informed from your sagacity to be necessary for the structure, shall through their care be immediately sent. Respecting the columns or the marbles, whatever you may judge to be more precious and useful, do you yourself after having inspected the plan take care to write to us; that when we shall understand from your letter how many things and of what kind there may be need of, these may be conveyed to you from all quarters: for it is but just that the most wonderful place in the world, should be adorned in accordance with its dignity. But I wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from you, whether you consider that the vault of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> should be fretted, or constructed on some other plan: for if it is to be fretted, it can also be decorated with gold. It remains that your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> should inform the officers before mentioned as soon as possible, how many workmen and artificers, and what money for expenses you will want. Be careful at the same time to report to me speedily, not only concerning the marbles and columns, but also concerning the fretted vault, if indeed you should decide this to be the more beautiful. May God preserve you, beloved brother.<br> <br></p>

<p>The emperor having also written other letters of a more oratorical character against <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his adherents, caused them to be everywhere published throughout the cities, exposing him to ridicule, and taunting him with irony. Moreover, writing to the <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedians</a> against Eusebius and Theognis, he censures the misconduct of Eusebius, not only on account of his <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, but because also having formerly been well-affected to the ruler, he had traitorously conspired against his affairs. He then exhorts them to elect another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> instead of him. But I thought it would be superfluous to insert here the letters respecting these things, because of their length: those who wish to do so may find them elsewhere and give them a perusal. This is sufficient notice of these transactions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. The Emperor also summons to the Synod Acesius, Bishop of the Novatians.</h2>

<p>The emperor's diligence induces me to mention another circumstance expressive of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and serving to show how much he desired peace. For aiming at <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> harmony, he summoned to the council Acesius also, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of Novatians. Now, when the declaration of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had been written out and subscribed by the Synod, the emperor asked Acesius whether he would also agree to this creed to the settlement of the day on which <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> should be observed. He replied, 'The Synod has determined nothing new, my prince: for thus heretofore, even from the beginning, from the times of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, I traditionally received the definition of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the time of the celebration of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>.' When, therefore, the emperor further asked him, 'For what reason then do you separate yourself from communion with the rest of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.' he related what had taken place during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>; and referred to the rigidness of that austere canon which declares, that it is not right <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> have committed a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which the sacred Scriptures denominate 'a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unto death' <span class="stiki" id="note260191"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;5:16</a></span> to be considered worthy of participation in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>:  that they should indeed be exhorted to repentance, but were not to expect remission from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is able and has authority to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.  When Acesius had thus spoken, the emperor said to him, 'Place a ladder, Acesius, and climb alone into heaven.'  Neither <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius Pamphilus</a> nor any other has ever mentioned these things: but I heard them from a man by no means prone to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, who was very old, and simply stated what had taken place in the council in the course of a narrative. From which I conjecture that those who have passed by this occurrence in silence, were actuated by motives which have influenced many other historians: for they frequently suppress important facts, either from prejudice against some, or partiality towards others.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Of the Bishop Paphnutius.</h2>

<p>As we have promised above  to make some mention of Paphnutius and Spyridon, it is time to speak of them here. Paphnutius then was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of one of the cities in Upper Thebes: he was a man so favored divinely that extraordinary <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were done by him. In the time of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> he had been deprived of one of his eyes. The emperor <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> this man exceedingly, and often sent for him to the palace, and kissed the part where the eye had been torn out. So great devoutness characterized the emperor Constantine. Let this single fact respecting Paphnutius suffice: I shall now explain another thing which came to pass in consequence of his advice, both for the good of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It seemed fit to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to introduce a new law into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that those who were in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders, I speak of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, should have no conjugal intercourse with the wives whom they had married while still <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>.  Now when discussion on this matter was impending, Paphnutius having arisen in the midst of the assembly of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, earnestly entreated them not to impose so heavy a yoke on the ministers of religion: asserting that 'marriage itself is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>, and the bed undefiled'; <span class="stiki" id="note260197"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;13:4</a></span> urging before God that they ought not to injure the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by too stringent restrictions. 'For all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,' said he, 'cannot bear the practice of rigid continence; neither perhaps would the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of the wife of each be preserved': and he termed the intercourse of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his lawful wife <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. It would be sufficient, he thought, that such as had previously entered on their sacred calling should abjure matrimony, according to the ancient tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: but that none should be separated from her to whom, while yet unordained, he had been united. And these sentiments he expressed, although himself without experience of marriage, and, to speak plainly, without ever having <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: for from a boy he had been brought up in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>,  and was specially renowned above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for his <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. The whole assembly of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> assented to the reasoning of Paphnutius: wherefore they silenced all further debate on this point, leaving it to the discretion of those who were husbands to exercise abstinence if they so wished in reference to their wives. Thus much concerning Paphnutius.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Of Spyridon, Bishop of the Cypriots.</h2>

<p>With respect to Spyridon, so great was his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> while a shepherd, that he was thought worthy of being made a Pastor of men: and having been assigned the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> of one of the cities in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> named Trimithus, on account of his extreme humility he continued to feed his sheep during his incumbency of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>. Many extraordinary things are related of him: I shall however record but one or two, lest I should seem to wander from my subject. Once about midnight, thieves having clandestinely entered his sheepfold attempted to carry off some of the sheep. But God who protected the shepherd preserved his sheep also; for the thieves were by an invisible power bound to the folds. At daybreak, when he came to the sheep and found the men with their hands tied behind them, he understood what was done: and after having <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> he liberated the thieves, earnestly admonishing and exhorting them to support themselves by honest labor, and not to take anything <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>. He then gave them a ram, and sent them away, humorously adding, 'that you may not appear to have watched all night in vain.' This is one of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in connection with Spyridon. Another was of this kind. He had a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> daughter named Irene, who was a partaker of her father's <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. An acquaintance entrusted to her keeping an ornament of considerable value: she, to guard it more securely, hid what had been deposited with her in the ground, and not long afterwards died. Subsequently the owner of the property came to claim it; and not finding the virgin, he began an excited conversation with the father, at times accusing him of an attempt to defraud him, and then again beseeching him to restore the deposit. The old man, regarding this person's loss as his own misfortune, went to the tomb of his daughter, and called upon God to show him before its proper season the promised resurrection. Nor was he disappointed in his hope: for the virgin again reviving appeared to her father, and having pointed out to him the spot where she had hidden the ornament, she once more departed. Such characters as these adorned the churches in the time of the emperor Constantine. These details I obtained from many inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. I have also found a treatise composed in Latin by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Rufinus, from which I have collected these and some other things which will be hereafter adduced.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Of Eutychian the Monk.</h2>

<p>I have heard moreover concerning Eutychian, a devout person who flourished about the same time; who also belonged to the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> church, yet was venerated for the performance of similar <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. I shall unequivocally state my authority for this narrative, nor will I attempt to conceal it, even though I give offense to some parties. It was Auxanon, a very aged <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> church; who when quite a youth accompanied Acesius to the Synod at Nic&aelig;a, and related to me what I have said concerning him. His life extended from that period to the reign of Theodosius the Younger; and when I was a mere youth he recounted to me the acts of Eutychian, enlarging much on the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> which was manifested in him: but one circumstance he alluded to, which occurred in the reign of Constantine, peculiarly worthy of mention. One of those military attendants, whom the emperor calls his domestic [or body] guards having been suspected of treasonable practices, sought his safety in flight. The indignant monarch ordered that he should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, wherever he might be found: who, having been arrested on the Bithynian Olympus, was bound with heavy and painful chains and kept imprisoned near those parts of Olympus where Eutychian was leading a solitary life, and healing both the bodies and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of many. The aged Auxanon being then very young was with him, and was being trained by him in the discipline of the monastic life. Many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> came to this Eutychian, entreating him to procure the release of the prisoner by interceding for him with the emperor. For the fame of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> done by Eutychian had reached the ears of the emperor. He readily promised to go to the sovereign; but as the chains inflicted intolerable suffering, those who interested themselves on his behalf declared that death caused by the effect of his chains would anticipate both the emperor's vengeance and any intercession that might be made for the prisoner. Accordingly Eutychian sent to the jailers requesting them to relieve the man; but they having answered that they should bring themselves into danger by relieving a criminal, he went himself to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, attended by Auxanon; and as they refused to open the jail, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which rested on Eutychian was rendered more conspicuous: for the gates of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> opened of their own accord, while the jailers had the keys in their custody. As soon as Eutychian, together with Auxanon, had entered the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, to the great astonishment of all then present the fetters spontaneously fell from the prisoner's limbs. He then proceeded with Auxanon to the city which was anciently called Byzantium but afterwards Constantinople, where having been admitted into the imperial palace, he saved the man from death; for the emperor, entertaining great veneration for Eutychian, readily granted his request. This indeed occurred some time after [the period to which this part of our history refers].</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were convened at the council of Nic&aelig;a, after having drawn up and enrolled certain other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> regulations which they are accustomed to term canons, again departed to their respective cities: and as I conceive it will be appreciated by lovers of learning, I shall here subjoin the names of such as were present, as far as I have been able to ascertain them, with the province and city over which they severally presided, and likewise the date at which this assembly took place. Hosius, who was I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Cordova in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, as I have before stated. Vito and Vicentius, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of Rome, Alexander, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Eustathius of Antiochia Magna, Macarius of Jerusalem, and Harpocration of Cynopolis: the names of the rest are fully reported in <em>The Synodicon</em>  of Athanasius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria. This Synod was convened (as we have discovered from the notation of the date prefixed to the record of the Synod) in the consulate of Paulinus and Julian, on the 20th day of May, and in the 636th year from the reign of Alexander the Macedonian.  Accordingly the work of the council was accomplished. It should be noted that after the council the emperor went into the western parts of the empire.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Eusebius Bishop of Nicomedia, and Theognis Bishop of Nic&aelig;a, who had been banished for agreeing in Opinion with Arius, having published their Recantation, and assented to the Creed, are reinstated in their Sees.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Eusebius  and Theognis having sent a penitential confession to the principal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, were by an imperial edict recalled from exile and restored to their own churches, displacing those who had been ordained in their places; Eusebius [displacing] Amphion, and Theognis Chrestus. This is a copy of their written retraction:<br> <br></span> </p>

<p>'We having been sometime since condemned by your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, without a formal trial, ought to bear in silence the decisions of your sacred adjudication. But since it is unreasonable that we by silence should countenance caluminators against ourselves, we on this account declare that we entirely concur with you in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and also that, after having closely considered the import of the term <em>consubstantial</em>, we have been wholly studious of peace, having never followed the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. After suggesting whatever entered our thought for the security of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and fully assuring those under our influence, we subscribed the declaration of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; we did not subscribe the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a>; not as objecting to the creed, but as disbelieving the party accused to be such as was represented, having been satisfied on this point, both from his own letters to us, and from personal conversations. But if your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council was convinced, we not opposing but concurring in your decisions, by this statement give them our full assent and confirmation: and this we do not as wearied with our exile, but to shake off the suspicion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. If therefore ye should now think fit to restore us to your presence, you will have us on all points conformable, and acquiescent in your decrees: especially since it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to deal tenderly with and recall even him who was primarily accused. It would be absurd for us to be silent, and thus give presumptive evidence against ourselves, when the one who seemed responsible has been permitted to clear himself from the charges brought against him. Vouchsafe then, as is consistent with that Christ-loving <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of yours, to remind our most religious emperor, to present our petitions, and to determine speedily concerning us in a way becoming yourselves.'</p>

<p>Such was the language of the recantation of Eusebius and Theognis; from which I infer that they had subscribed the articles of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which had been set forth, but would not become parties to the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>. It appears also that <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> was recalled before them; but, although this may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, yet he had been forbidden to enter Alexandria. This is evident from the fact that he afterwards devised a way of return for himself, both into the church and into Alexandria, by having made a fictitious repentance, as we shall show in its proper place.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. After the Synod, on the Death of Alexander, Athanasius is constituted Bishop of Alexandria.</h2>

<p>A little after this, Alexander <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria having died,  Athanasius was set over that church. Rufinus relates, that this [Athanasius] when quite a boy, played with others of his own age at a sacred game: this was an imitation of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the order of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. In this game therefore Athanasius was allotted the episcopal chair, and each of the other lads personated either a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. The children engaged in this sport on the day in which the memory of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Peter was celebrated. Now at that time Alexander <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria happening to pass by, observed the play in which they were engaged, and having sent for the children, enquired from them the part each had been assigned in the game, conceiving that something might be portended by that which had been done. He then gave directions that the children should be taken to the church, and instructed in learning, but especially Athanasius; and having afterwards ordained him <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> on his becoming of adult age, he brought him to Nic&aelig;a to assist him in the disputations there when the Synod was convened. This account of Athanasius Rufinus has given in his own writings; nor is it improbable that it took place, for many transactions of this kind have often occurred. Concerning this matter it will suffice to have said the above.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 16. The Emperor Constantine having enlarged the Ancient Byzantium, calls it Constantinople.</h2>

<p>After the Synod the emperor spent some time in recreation, and after the public celebration of his twentieth anniversary of his accession,  he immediately devoted himself to the reparation of the churches. This he carried into effect in other cities as well as in the city named after him, which being previously called Byzantium, he enlarged, surrounded with massive walls,  and adorned with various edifices; and having rendered it equal to imperial Rome, he named it <em>Constantinople</em>, establishing by law that it should be designated <em>New Rome.</em> This law was engraven on a pillar of stone erected in public view in the Strategium,  near the emperor's equestrian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>.  He built also in the same city two churches, one of which he named <em>Irene</em>, and the other <em>The Apostles.</em>  Nor did he only improve the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, as I have said, but he also destroyed the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>; for he brought forth their images into public view to ornament the city of Constantinople, and set up the Delphic tripods publicly in the Hippodrome. It may indeed seem now superfluous to mention these things, since they are seen before they are heard of. But at that time the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> received its greatest augmentation; for <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> preserved very many other things during the times of the emperor Constantine.  <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius Pamphilus</a> has in magnificent terms recorded the praises of the emperor;  and I considered it would not be ill-timed to advert thus to them as concisely as possible.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 17. The Emperor's Mother Helena having come to Jerusalem, searches for and finds the Cross of Christ, and builds a Church.</h2>

<p>Helena, the emperor's mother (from whose name having made Drepanum, once a village, a city, the emperor called it Helenopolis), being divinely directed by dreams went to Jerusalem. Finding that which was once Jerusalem, desolate 'as a Preserve for autumnal fruits,'  according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, she sought carefully the sepulchre of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, from which he arose after his burial; and after much difficulty, by God's help she discovered it. What the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the difficulty was I will explain in a few words. Those who embraced the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, after the period of his passion, greatly venerated this tomb; but those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, having covered the spot with a mound of earth, erected on it a temple to Venus, and set up her image there, not caring for the memory of the place.  This succeeded for a long time; and it became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the emperor's mother. Accordingly she having caused the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>  to be thrown down, the earth to be removed, and the ground entirely cleared, found three crosses in the sepulchre: one of these was that blessed cross on which Christ had hung, the other two were those on which the two thieves that were crucified with him had died. With these was also found the tablet  of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, on which he had inscribed in various characters, that the Christ who was crucified was king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Since, however, it was doubtful which was the cross they were in search of, the emperor's mother was not a little distressed; but from this trouble the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem, Macarius, shortly relieved her. And he solved the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for he sought a sign from God and obtained it. The sign was this: a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of the neighborhood, who had been long afflicted with disease, was now just at the point of death; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> therefore arranged it so that each of the crosses should be brought to the dying <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, believing that she would be healed on touching the precious cross. Nor was he disappointed in his expectation: for the two crosses having been applied which were not the Lord's, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> still continued in a dying state; but when the third, which was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> cross, touched her, she was immediately healed, and recovered her former strength. In this manner then was the genuine cross discovered. The emperor's mother erected over the place of the sepulchre a magnificent church,  and named it <em>New Jerusalem</em>, having built it facing that old and deserted city. There she left a portion of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, enclosed in a silver case, as a memorial to those who might wish to see it: the other part she sent to the emperor, who being persuaded that the city would be perfectly secure where that relic should be preserved, privately enclosed it in his own <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, which stands on a large column of porphyry in the forum called Constantine's at Constantinople. I have written this from report indeed; but almost all the inhabitants of Constantinople affirm that it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Moreover the nails with which Christ's hands were fastened to the cross (for his mother having found these also in the sepulchre had sent them) Constantine took and had made into bridle-bits and a helmet, which he used in his military expeditions. The emperor supplied all materials for the construction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and wrote to Macarius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to expedite these edifices. When the emperor's mother had completed the <em>New Jerusalem</em>, she reared another church not at all inferior, over the cave at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> where Christ was born according to the flesh: nor did she stop here, but built a third on the mount of his Ascension. So devoutly was she affected in these matters, that she would <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in the company of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; and inviting the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> enrolled in the register  of the churches to a repast, serving them herself, she brought the dishes to table. She was also very munificent to the churches and to the poor; and having lived a life of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, she died when about eighty years old. Her remains were conveyed to New Rome, the capital, and deposited in the imperial sepulchres.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 18. The Emperor Constantine abolishes Paganism and erects many Churches in Different Places.</h2>

<p>After this the emperor became increasingly attentive to the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and abandoned the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>. He abolished the combats of the gladiators, and set up his own <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> in the temples. And as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> affirmed that it was Serapis who brought up the Nile for the purpose of irrigating <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, because a cubit was usually carried into his temple, he directed Alexander to transfer the cubit to the church. And although they predicted that the Nile would not overflow because of the displeasure of Serapis, nevertheless there was an inundation in the following year and afterwards, taking place regularly: thus it was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by fact that the rising of the Nile was not in consequence of their <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, but by reason of the decrees of Providence. About the same time those barbarians the Sarmatians and Goths made incursions on the Roman territory; yet the emperor's earnestness respecting the churches was by no means abated, but he made suitable provision for both these matters. Placing his confidence in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> banner,  he completely vanquished his enemies, so as even to cast off the tribute of gold which preceding emperors were accustomed to pay the barbarians: while they themselves, being terror-struck at the unexpectedness of their defeat, then for the first time embraced the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, by means of which Constantine had been protected. Again he built other churches, one of which was erected near the Oak of Mamre, under which the Sacred Oracles declare that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> entertained <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For the emperor having been informed that altars had been reared under that oak, and that pagan <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were offered upon them, censured by letter Eusebius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea, and ordered that the altars should be demolished, and a house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> erected beside the oak. He also directed that another church should be constructed in Heliopolis in <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, for this reason. Who originally legislated for the inhabitants of Heliopolis I am unable to state, but his character and morals may be judged of from the [practice of that] city; for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the country ordered the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> among them to be common, and therefore the children born there were of doubtful descent, so that there was no distinction of fathers and their offspring. Their <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> also were presented for prostitution to the strangers who resorted there. The emperor hastened to correct this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which had long prevailed among them. And passing a solemn law of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, he removed the shameful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and provided for the mutual recognition of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. And having built churches there, he took care that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and sacred <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should be ordained. Thus he reformed the corrupt manners of the people of Heliopolis. He likewise demolished the temple of Venus at Aphaca on Mount Libanus, and abolished the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which were there celebrated. Why need I describe his expulsion of the Pythonic <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> from Cilicia, by commanding the mansion in which he was lurking to be razed from its foundations? So great indeed was the emperor's devotion to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, that when he was about to enter on a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, he prepared a tabernacle formed of embroidered linen on the model of a church, just as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had done in the wilderness; <span class="stiki" id="note260219"><a href="../bible/exo035.htm">Exodus&nbsp;xxxv.-xl</a></span> and this so constructed as to be adapted to conveyance from place to place, in order that he might have a house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> even in the most desert regions. But the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was not at that time carried on, being prevented through dread of the emperor. It would, I conceive, be out of place here to describe the emperor's diligence in rebuilding cities and converting many villages into cities; as for example Drepanum, to which he gave his mother's name, and Constantia in Palestine, so called from his sister. For my task is not to enumerate of the emperor's actions, but simply such as are connected with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and especially those which relate to the churches. Wherefore I leave to others more competent to detail such matters, the emperor's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> achievements, inasmuch as they belong to a different subject, and require a distinct treatise. But I myself should have been silent, if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had remained undisturbed by divisions: for where the subject does not supply matter for relation, there is no necessity for a narrator. Since however subtle and vain disputation has confused and at the same time scattered the apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, I thought it desirable to record these things, in order that the transactions of the churches might not be lost in obscurity. For accurate information on these points procures celebrity among the many, and at the same time renders him who is acquainted with them more secure from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and instructs him not to be carried away by any empty sound of sophistical argumentation which he may chance to hear.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 19.  &mdash; In what Manner the Nations in the Interior of India were Christianized in the Times of Constantine.</h2>

<p>We must now mention in what manner <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was spread in this emperor's reign: for it was in his time that the nations both of the Indians in the interior, and of the Iberians first embraced the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But I shall briefly explain why I have used the appended expression <em>in the interior.</em> When the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> went forth by lot among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, Thomas received the apostleship of the Parthians; Matthew was allotted <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>; and Bartholomew the part of India contiguous to that country: but the interior India, in which many barbarous nations using different languages lived, was not enlightened by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine before the times of Constantine. I now come to speak of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which led them to become converts to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. A certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, Meropius, a Tyrian by race, determined to acquaint himself with the country of the Indians, being stimulated to this by the example of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Metrodorus, who had previously traveled through the region of India. Having taken with him therefore two youths to whom he was related, who were by no means <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Greek language, Meropius reached the country by ship; and when he had inspected whatever he wished, he touched at a certain place which had a safe harbor, for the purpose of procuring some necessaries. It so happened that a little before that time the treaty between the Romans and Indians had been violated. The Indians, therefore, having seized the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and those who sailed with him, killed them all except his two youthful kinsmen; but sparing them from compassion for their tender age, they sent them as a gift to the king of the Indians. He being pleased with the personal appearance of the youths, constituted one of them, whose name was Edesius, cup-bearer at his table; the other, named Frumentius, he entrusted with the care of the royal records. The king dying soon after, left them free, the government devolving on his wife and infant son. Now the queen seeing her son thus left in his minority, begged the young men to undertake the charge of him, until he should become of adult age. Accordingly, the youths accepted the task, and entered on the administration of the kingdom. Thus Frumentius controlled all things and made it a task to enquire whether among the Roman merchants trafficking with that country, there were any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to be found: and having discovered some, he informed them who he was, and exhorted them to select and occupy some appropriate places for the celebration of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> worship. In the course of a little while he built a house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and having instructed some of the Indians in the principles of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, they fitted them for participation in the worship. On the young king's reaching maturity, Frumentius and his associates resigned to him the administration of public affairs, in the management of which they had honorably acquitted themselves, and besought permission to return to their own country. Both the king and his mother entreated them to remain; but being desirous of revisiting their native place, they could not be prevailed on, and consequently departed. Edesius for his part hastened to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> to see his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and kindred; but Frumentius arriving at Alexandria, reported the affair to Athanasius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who had but recently been invested with that dignity; and acquainting him both with the particulars of his wanderings and the hopes Indians had of receiving <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.  He also begged him to send a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there, and by no means to neglect those who might thus be brought to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Athanasius having considered how this could be most profitably effected, requested Frumentius himself to accept the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>, declaring that he could appoint no one more suitable than he was. Accordingly this was done; Frumentius invested with episcopal authority, returned to India and became there a preacher of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and built several churches, being aided also by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, he performed various <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, healing with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> also the bodily diseases of many. Rufinus assures us that he heard these facts from Edesius, who was afterwards ordained to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 20. In what Manner the Iberians were converted to Christianity.</h2>

<p>It is now proper to relate how the Iberians  about the same time became proselytes to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. A certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> leading a devout and chaste life, was, in the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> ordering of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, taken captive by the Iberians. Now these Iberians dwell near the Euxine Sea, and are a colony of the Iberians of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in her captivity exercised  herself among the barbarians in the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for she not only maintained the most rigid continence, but spent much time in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The barbarians observing this were astonished at the strangeness of her conduct. It happened then that the king's son, then a mere babe, was attacked with disease; the queen, according to the custom of the country, sent the child to other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to be cured, in the hope that their experience would supply a remedy. After the infant had been carried around by its nurse without obtaining relief from any of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, he was at length brought to this captive. She had no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the medical art, and applied no material remedy; but taking the child and laying it on her bed which was made of horsecloth, in the presence of other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, she simply said, 'Christ, who healed many, will heal this child also'; then having <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in addition to this expression of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and called upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the boy was immediately restored, and continued well from that period. The report of this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> spread itself far and wide among the barbarian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and soon reached the queen, so that the captive became very celebrated. Not long afterwards the queen herself having fallen sick sent for the captive <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Inasmuch as she being a person of modest and retiring manners excused herself from going, the queen was conveyed to her. The captive did the same to her as she had done to her son before; and immediately the disease was removed. And the queen thanked the stranger; but she replied, 'this work is not mine, but Christ's, who is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> that made the world'; she therefore exhorted her to call upon him, and acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Amazed at his wife's sudden restoration to health, the king of the Iberians wished to requite with gifts her whom he had understood to be the means of effecting these cures; she however said that she needed not riches, inasmuch as she possessed as riches the consolations of religion; but that she would regard as the greatest present he could offer her, his recognition of the God whom she worshipped and declared. With this she sent back the gifts. This answer the king treasured up in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and going forth to the chase the next day, the following circumstance occurred: a mist and thick darkness covered the mountain tops and forests where he was hunting, so that their sport was embarrassed, and their path became inextricable. In this perplexity the prince earnestly invoked the gods whom he worshipped; and as it availed nothing, he at last determined to implore the assistance of the captive's <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; when scarcely had he begun to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, ere the darkness arising from the mist was completely dissipated. Wondering at that which was done, he returned to his palace rejoicing, and related to his wife what had happened; he also immediately sent for the captive stranger, and begged her to inform him who that God was whom she adored. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> on her arrival caused the king of the Iberians to become a preacher of Christ: for having <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Christ through this devoted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, he convened all the Iberians who were under his authority; and when he had declared to them what had taken place in reference to the cure of his wife and child not only, but also the circumstances connected with the chase, he exhorted them to worship the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the captive. Thus, therefore, both the king and the queen were made preachers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the one addressing their male, and the other their female subjects. Moreover, the king having ascertained from his prisoner the plan on which churches were constructed among the Romans, ordered a church to be built, and immediately provided all things necessary for its erection; and the edifice was accordingly commenced. But when they came to set up the pillars, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> interposed for the confirmation of the inhabitants in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for one of the columns remained immovable, and no means were found capable of moving it; but their ropes broke and their machinery fell to pieces; at length the workmen gave up all further effort and departed. Then was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the reality of the captive's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the following manner: going to the place at night without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of any one, she spent the whole time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and by the power of God the pillar was raised, and stood erect in the air above its base, yet so as not to touch it. At daybreak the king, who was an intelligent person, came himself to inspect the work, and seeing the pillar suspended in this position without support, both he and his attendants were amazed. Shortly after, in fact before their very eyes, the pillar descended on its own pedestal, and there remained fixed. Upon this the people shouted, attesting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the king's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and hymning the praise of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the captive. They <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> thenceforth, and with eagerness raised the rest of the columns, and the whole building was soon completed. An embassy was afterwards sent to the Emperor Constantine, requesting that henceforth they might be in alliance with the Romans, and receive from them a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, since they sincerely <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Rufinus says that he learned these facts from Bacurius,  who was formerly one of the petty princes  of the Iberians, but subsequently went over to the Romans, and was made a captain of the military force in Palestine; being at length entrusted with the supreme command in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the tyrant Maximus, he assisted the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>. In this way then, during the days of Constantine, were the Iberians also converted to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Of Anthony the Monk.</h2>

<p>What sort of a man the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Anthony was, who lived in the same age, in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> desert, and how he openly contended with devils, clearly detecting their devices and wily modes of warfare, and how he performed many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, it would be superfluous for us to say; for Athanasius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, has anticipated us, having devoted an entire book to his biography.  Of such good men there was a large number at one time during the years of the Emperor Constantine.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Manes, the Founder of the Manich&aelig;an Heresy, and on his Origin.</h2>

<p>But amidst the good wheat, tares are accustomed to spring up; for <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> loves to plot insidiously against the good. Hence it was that a little while before the time of Constantine, a species of heathenish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> made its appearance together with that which was real; just as <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> sprang up among the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> among the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For at that time a dogma of Empedocles, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, by means of Manich&aelig;us, assumed the form of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius Pamphilus</a> has indeed mentioned this person in the seventh book of his Ecclesiastical History,  but has not entered into minute details concerning him. Wherefore, I deem it incumbent on me to supply some particulars which he has left unnoticed: thus it will be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> who this Manich&aelig;us was, whence he came, and what was the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his presumptuous daring.<br> <br></p>

<p>A Saracen named Scythian married a captive from the Upper Thebes. On her account he dwelt in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and having versed himself in the learning of the Egyptians, he subtly introduced the theory of Empedocles and Pythagoras among the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Asserting that there were two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, a good and an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one, he termed, as Empedocles had done, the latter Discord, and the former Friendship. Of this Scythian, Buddas, who had been previously called Terebinthus, became a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>; and he having proceeded to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, which the Persians inhabit, made many extravagant statements respecting himself, declaring that he was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and brought up in the mountains. The same man afterwards composed four books, one he entitled <em>The Mysteries</em>, another <em>The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, a third <em>The Treasure</em>, and the fourth <em>Heads</em> [<em>Summaries</em>]; but pretending to perform some mystic <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, he was hurled down a precipice by a spirit,  and so perished. A certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> at whose house he had lodged buried him, and taking possession of his property, bought a boy about seven years old whose name was Cubricus: this lad she enfranchised, and having given him a liberal education, she soon after died, leaving him all that belonged to Terebinthus, including the books he had written on the principles inculcated by Scythian. Cubricus, the freedman, taking these things with him and having withdrawn into the regions of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, changed his name, calling himself Manes; and disseminated the books of Buddas or Terebinthus among his deluded followers as his own. Now the contents of these treatises apparently agree with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in expression, but are pagan in sentiment: for Manich&aelig;us being an atheist, incited his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to acknowledge a plurality of gods, and taught them to worship the sun. He also introduced the doctrine of Fate, denying <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; and affirmed a transmutation  of bodies, clearly following the opinions of Empedocles, Pythagoras, and the Egyptians. He denied that Christ <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the flesh, asserting that he was an apparition; and rejected moreover the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, calling himself the 'Comforter,'&mdash; all of which <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> are totally at variance with the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the church. In his epistles he even dared to call himself an apostle; but for a pretension so unfounded he brought upon himself merited retribution in the following manner. The son of the Persian monarch having been attacked with disease, his father became anxious for his recovery, and left no means untried in order to effect it; and as he had heard of the wonder-working of Manich&aelig;us, and thinking that these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were real, he sent for him as an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, trusting that through him his son might be restored. He accordingly presented himself at court, and with his assumed manner undertook the treatment of the young prince. But the king seeing that the child died in his hands shut up the deceiver in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, with the intention of putting him to death. However, he contrived to escape, and fled into Mesopotamia; but the king of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> having discovered that he was dwelling there, caused him to be brought thence by force, and after having flayed him alive, he stuffed his skin with chaff, and suspended it in front of the gate of the city. These things we state not having manufactured them ourselves, but collected from a book entitled <em>The disputation of Archelaus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Caschara</em> (one of the cities of Mesopotamia).  For Archelaus himself states that he disputed with Manich&aelig;us face to face, and mentions the circumstances connected with his life to which we have now alluded. Envy thus delights, as we before remarked, to be insidiously at work in the midst of a prosperous condition of affairs. But for what reason the goodness of God permits this to be done, whether he wishes thereby to bring into activity the excellence of the principles of the church, and to utterly break down the self-importance which is wont to unite itself with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; or for what other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is, at the same time, a difficult question, and not relevant to the present discussion. For our object is neither to examine the soundness of doctrinal views, nor to analyze the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> reasons for the providences and judgments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but to detail as faithfully as possible the history of transactions which have taken place in the churches. The way in which the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> sprang up a little before the time of Constantine has been thus described; now let us return to the times and events which are the proper subjects of this history.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Eusebius Bishop of Nicomedia, and Theognis Bishop of Nic&aelig;a, having recovered Confidence, endeavor to subvert the Nicene Creed, by plotting against Athanasius.</h2>

<p>The partisans of Eusebius and Theognis having returned from their exile, these latter were reinstated in their churches, having expelled, as we observed, those who had been ordained in their stead. Moreover, they came into great consideration with the emperor, who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> them exceedingly, as those who had returned from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. They, however, abused the license thus afforded them, by exciting greater commotions in the world than they had done before; being instigated to this by two causes&mdash; on the one hand the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> with which they had been previously infected, and bitter animosity against Athanasius on the other, because he had so vigorously withstood them in the Synod while the articles of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were under discussion. And in the first place they objected to the ordination of Athanasius partly as a person unworthy of the prelacy, and partly because he had been elected by disqualified <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. But when Athanasius had shown himself superior to this <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> (for having assumed control of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">church of Alexandria</a>, he ardently contended for the Nicene creed), then Eusebius exerted himself to the utmost insidiously to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the removal of Athanasius and to bring <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> back to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>; for he thought that thus only he should be able to expunge the doctrine of consubstantiality, and introduce <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. Eusebius therefore wrote to Athanasius, desiring him to re-admit <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his adherents into the church. Now the tone of his letter indeed was that of entreaty, but openly he menaced him. And as Athanasius would by no means accede to this, he endeavored to induce the emperor to give <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> an audience, and then permit him to return to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>: and by what means he attained his object, I shall mention in its proper place. Meanwhile before this another commotion was raised in the church. In fact, her own children again disturbed her peace. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius Pamphilus</a> says,  that immediately after the Synod, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> became agitated by intestine divisions: not assigning, however, the reason for this, so that hence he has won the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of disingenuousness, and of avoiding to specify the causes of these dissensions, from a determination on his part not to give his sanction to the proceedings at Nic&aelig;a. Yet as we ourselves have discovered from various letters which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> wrote to one another after the Synod, the term <em>homoousios</em> troubled some of them. So that while they occupied themselves in a too minute investigation of its import, they roused the strife against each other; it seemed not unlike a contest in the dark; for neither party appeared to understand distinctly the grounds on which they <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> one another. Those who objected to the word <em>homoousios</em>, conceived that those who approved it favored the opinion of Sabellius  and <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>;  they therefore called them <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>, as subverting the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And again the advocates of this term, charging their opponents with <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, inveighed against them as introducers of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>. Eustathius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, accuses <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius Pamphilus</a> of perverting the Nicene Creed; Eusebius again denies that he violates that exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and recriminates, saying that Eustathius was a defender of the opinion of Sabellius. In consequence of these misunderstandings, each of them wrote as if contending against adversaries: and although it was admitted on both sides that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has a distinct person and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and all acknowledged that there is one God in three Persons, yet from what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I am unable to divine, they could not agree among themselves, and therefore could in no way endure to be at peace.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Of the Synod held at Antioch, which deposed Eustathius, Bishop of Antioch, on whose account a Sedition broke out and almost ruined the City.</h2>

<p>Having therefore convened a Synod at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, they deposed Eustathius, as a supporter of the Sabellian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, rather than of the tenets which the council at Nic&aelig;a had formulated. As some affirm [this measure was taken] for other and unsatisfactory reasons, though none other have been openly assigned: this is a matter of common occurrence; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are accustomed to do this in all cases, accusing and pronouncing impious those whom they depose, but not explaining their warrant for so doing. George, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, one of the number of those who abominated the term <em>homoousios</em>, assures us in his <em>Encomium of Eusebius Emisenus</em>, that they deposed Eustathius as favoring Sabellianism, on the impeachment of Cyrus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ber&oelig;a. Of Eusebius Emisenus we shall speak elsewhere in due order.  George has written of Eustathius [somewhat inconsistently]; for after asserting that he was accused by Cyrus of maintaining the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Sabellius, he tells us again that Cyrus himself was convicted of the same <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and degraded for it. Now how was it possible that Cyrus should accuse Eustathius as a Sabellian, when he inclined to Sabellianism himself? It appears likely therefore that Eustathius must have been condemned on other grounds. At that time, however, there arose a dangerous sedition at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> on account of his deposition: for when they proceeded to the election of a successor, so fierce a dissension was kindled, as to threaten the whole city with destruction. The populace was divided into two factions, one of which vehemently contended for the translation of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius Pamphilus</a> from <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">C&aelig;sarea in Palestine</a> to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; the other equally insisted on the reinstatement of Eustathius. And the populace of the city were infected with the spirit of partisanship in this quarrel among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, a military force was arrayed on both sides with hostile intent, so that a bloody collision would have taken place, had not God and the dread of the emperor repressed the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the multitude. For the emperor through letters, and Eusebius by refusing to accept the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>, served to allay the ferment: on which account that prelate was exceedingly admired by the emperor, who wrote to him commending his <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> determination, and congratulating him as one who was considered worthy of being <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> not of one city merely, but of almost the whole world. Consequently it is said that the episcopal chair of the church at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> was vacant for eight consecutive years after this period;  but at length by the exertions of those who aimed at the subversion of the Nicene creed, Euphronius was duly installed. This is the amount of my information respecting the Synod held at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> on account of Eustathius. Immediately after these events Eusebius, who had long before left Berytus, and was at that time presiding over the church at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, strenuously exerted himself in connection to those of his party, to bring back <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>. But how they managed to effect this, and by what means the emperor was prevailed  on to admit both <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and with him Euzo&iuml;us into his presence must now be related.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 25. Of the Presbyter who exerted himself for the Recall of Arius. </h2>

<p>The Emperor Constantine had a sister named Constantia, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Licinius, who had for some time shared the imperial dignity with Constantine, but had assumed tyrannical powers and had been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in consequence. This princess maintained in her household establishment a certain confidential <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, tinctured with the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>; Eusebius and others having prompted him, he took occasion in his familiar conversations with Constantia, to insinuate that the Synod had done <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and that the common report concerning him was not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Constantia gave full credence to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter's</a> assertions, but dared not report them to the emperor. Now it happened that she became dangerously ill, and her brother visited her daily. As the disease became aggravated and she expected to die, she commended this <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> to the emperor, testifying to his diligence and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, as well as his devoted loyalty to his sovereign. She died soon after, whereupon the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> became one of the most confidential <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> about the emperor; and having gradually increased in freedom of speech, he repeated to the emperor what he had before stated to his sister, affirming that <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> had no other views than the sentiments avowed by the Synod; and that if he were admitted to the imperial presence, he would give his full assent to what the Synod had decreed: he added, moreover, that he had been unreasonably <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter's</a> words appeared strange to the emperor, and he said, 'If <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> subscribes with the Synod and holds its views, I will both give him an audience, and send him back to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.' Having thus said, he immediately wrote to him in these words:</p>

<blockquote><p>' <em>Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>.</em>'</p>

<p>It was intimated to your reverence some time since, that you might come to my court, in order to obtain an interview with us. We are not a little surprised that you did not do this immediately. Wherefore having at once mounted a public vehicle, hasten to arrive at our court; that when you have experienced our clemency and regard for you, you may return to your own country. May God protect you, beloved. Dated the twenty-fifth of November.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the letter of the emperor to <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>. And I cannot but admire the ardent <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> which the prince manifested for religion: for it appears from this document that he had often before exhorted <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> to change his views, inasmuch as he censures his delaying to return to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, although he had himself written frequently to him. Now on the receipt of this letter, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> came to Constantinople accompanied by Euzo&iuml;us, whom Alexander had divested of his deaconship when he <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his partisans. The emperor accordingly admitted them to his presence, and asked them whether they would agree to the creed. And when they readily gave their assent, he ordered them to deliver to him a written statement of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Arius, on being recalled, presents a Recantation to the Emperor, and pretends to accept the Nicene Creed.</h2>

<p>They having drawn up a declaration to the following effect, presented it to the emperor.</p>

<p>'<a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Euzo&iuml;us, to our Most Religious and Pious Lord, the Emperor Constantine.</p>

<p>'In accordance with the command of your devout <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, sovereign lord, we declare our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and before God profess in writing, that we and our adherents <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> as follows:</p>

<p>'We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty: and in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> his Son, who was begotten  of him before all ages, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> through whom all things were made, both those which are in the heavens and those upon the earth; who descended, and became incarnate, and suffered, and rose again, ascended into the heavens, and will again come to judge the living and the dead. [We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>] also in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and in the resurrection of the flesh, and in the life of the coming age, and in the kingdom of the heavens, and in one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, extending from one end of the earth to the other.<br> <br></p>

<p>'This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we have received from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>, the Lord therein saying to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note260239"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;28:9</a></span> <q>Go and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> If we do not so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> receive the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scriptures teach (in which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in every respect), God is our judge both now, and in the coming judgment.

<h2>Chapter 27. Ariushaving returned to Alexandria with the Emperor's Consent, and not being received by Athanasius, the Partisans of Eusebius bring Many Charges against Athanasius before the Emperor.</h2>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a></span> having thus satisfied the emperor, returned to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>. But his artifice for suppressing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> did not succeed; for on his arrival at Alexandria, as Athanasius would not receive him, but turned away from him as a pest, he attempted to excite a fresh commotion in that city by disseminating his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Then indeed both Eusebius himself wrote, and prevailed on the emperor also to write, in order that <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his partisans might be readmitted into the church. Athanasius nevertheless wholly refused to receive them, and wrote to inform the emperor in reply, that it was impossible for those who had once rejected the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and had been <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, to be again received into communion on their return. But the emperor, provoked at this answer, menaced Athanasius in these terms:</p>

<p>'Since you have been apprised of my will, afford unhindered access into the church to all those who are desirous of entering it. For if it shall be intimated to me that you have prohibited any of those claiming to be reunited to the church, or have hindered their admission, I will immediately send some one who at my command shall depose you, and drive you into exile.'</p>

<p>The emperor wrote thus from a desire of promoting the public good, and because he did not wish to see the church ruptured; for he labored earnestly to bring them all into harmony. Then indeed the partisans of Eusebius, ill-disposed towards Athanasius, imagining they had found a seasonable opportunity, welcomed the emperor's displeasure as an auxiliary to their own purpose: and on this account they raised a great disturbance, endeavoring to eject him from his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>; for they entertained the hope that the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> doctrine would prevail only upon the removal of Athanasius. The chief conspirators against him were Eusebius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, Theognis of Nic&aelig;a, Maris of Chalcedon, Ursacius of Singidnum in Upper M&oelig;sia, and Valens of Mursa in Upper Pannonia. These <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> suborn by <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a> certain of the Melitian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to fabricate various charges against Athanasius; and first they accuse him through the Melitians Ision, Eud&aelig;mon and Callinicus, of having ordered the Egyptians to pay a linen garment as tribute to the church at Alexandria. But this <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> was immediately disproved by Alypius and Macarius, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> church, who then happened to be at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>; they having convinced the emperor that these statements to the prejudice of Athanasius were false. Wherefore the emperor by letter severely censured his accusers, but urged Athanasius to come to him. But before he came the Eusebian faction anticipating his arrival, added to their former accusation the charge of another crime of a still more serious nature than the former; charging Athanasius with plotting against his sovereign, and with having sent for treasonable purposes a chest full of gold to one Philumenus. When, however, the emperor had himself investigated this matter at Psamathia, which is in the suburbs of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, and had found Athanasius innocent, he dismissed him with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; and wrote with his own hand to the church at Alexandria to assure them that their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had been <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accused. It would indeed have been both proper and desirable to have passed over in silence the subsequent attacks which the Eusebians made upon Athanasius, lest from these circumstances the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be judged unfavorably of by those who are adverse to its interests.  But since having been already committed to writing, they have become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to everybody, I have on that account deemed it necessary to make as cursory allusion to these things as possible, the particulars of which would require a special treatise. Whence the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> accusation originated, and the character of those who devised it, I shall now therefore state in brief. Mareotes  is a district of Alexandria; there are contained in it very many villages, and an abundant population, with numerous splendid churches; these churches are all under the jurisdiction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, and are subject to his city as parishes.  There was in this region a person named Ischyras, who had been guilty of an act deserving of many deaths;  for although he had never been admitted to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders, he had the audacity to assume the title of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and to exercise sacred functions belonging to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. But having been detected in his <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> career, he made his escape thence and sought refuge in <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, where he implored the protection of the party of Eusebius; who from their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to Athanasius, not only received him as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, but even promised to confer upon him the dignity of the episcopacy, if he would frame an accusation against Athanasius, listening as a pretext for this to whatever stories Ischyras had invented. For he spread a report that he had suffered dreadfully in consequence of an assault; and that Macarius had rushed furiously toward the altar, had overturned the table, and broken a mystical cup: he added also that he had burnt the sacred books. As a reward for this accusation, the Eusebian faction, as I have said, promised him a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>; foreseeing that the charges against Macarius would involve, along with the accused party, Athanasius, under whose orders he would seem to have acted. But this charge they formulated later; before it they devised another full of the bitterest malignity, to which I shall now advert. Having by some means, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what, obtained a man's hand; whether they themselves had murdered any one, and cut off his hand, or had severed it from some dead body, God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and the authors of the deed: but be that as it may, they publicly exposed it as the hand of Arsenius, a Melitian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, while they kept the alleged owner of it concealed. This hand, they asserted, had been made use of by Athanasius in the performance of certain magic arts; and therefore it was made the gravest ground of accusation which these <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a> had concerted against him: but as it generally happens, all those who entertained any pique against Athanasius came forward at the same time with a variety of other charges. When the emperor was informed of these proceedings, he wrote to his nephew Dalmatius the censor, who then had his residence at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, directing him to order the accused parties to be brought before him, and after due investigation, to inflict punishment on such as might be convicted. He also sent there Eusebius and Theognis, that the case might be tried in their presence. When Athanasius <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he was to be summoned before the censor, he sent into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to make a strict search after Arsenius; and he ascertained indeed that he was secreted there, but was unable to apprehend him, because he often changed his place of concealment. Meanwhile the emperor suppressed the trial which was to have been held before the censor, on the following account.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 28. On Account of the Charges against Athanasius, the Emperor convokes a Synod of Bishops at Tyre.</h2>

<p>The emperor had ordered a Synod of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to be present at the consecration of the church which he had erected at Jerusalem. He therefore directed that, as a secondary matter, they should on their way first assemble at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, to examine into the charges against Athanasius; in order that all <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of contention being removed there, they might the more peacefully perform the inaugural ceremonies  in the dedication of the church of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This was the thirtieth year of Constantine's reign, and sixty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were thus convened at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> from various places, on the summons of Dionysius the consul. As to Macarius the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, he was conducted from <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> in chains, under a military escort; while Athanasius was unwilling to go there, not so much from dread, because he was innocent of the charges made, as because he feared lest any innovations should be made on the decisions of the council at Nic&aelig;a; he was, however, constrained to be present by the menacing letters of the emperor. For it had been written him that if he did not come voluntarily, he should be brought by force.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 29. Of Arsenius, and his Hand which was said to have been cut off.</h2>

<p>The special <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God drove Arsenius also to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>; for, disregarding the injunctions he had received from the accusers who had <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribed</a> him, he went there disguised to see what would be done. It by some means happened that the servants of Archelaus, the governor of the province, heard some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> at an inn affirm that Arsenius, who was reported to have been murdered, was concealed in the house of one of the citizens. Having heard this and marked the individuals by whom this statement was made, they communicated the information to their master, who causing strict search to be made for the man immediately, discovered and properly secured him; after which he gave notice to Athanasius that he need not be under any alarm, inasmuch as Arsenius was alive and there present. Arsenius on being apprehended, at first denied that he was the person; but <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, who had formerly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> him, established his identity. <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> having thus disposed matters, Athanasius was shortly after summoned by the Synod; and as soon as he presented himself, his traducers exhibited the hand, and pressed their charge. He managed the affair with great <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, for he enquired of those present, as well as of his accusers, who were the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Arsenius? And several having answered that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him, he caused Arsenius to be introduced, having his hands covered by his cloak. Then he again asked them, 'Is this the person who has lost a hand?' All were astonished at the unexpectedness of this procedure, except those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> whence the hand had been cut off; for the rest thought that Arsenius was really deficient of a hand, and expected that the accused would make his defense in some other way. But Athanasius turning back the cloak of Arsenius on one side showed one of the man's hands; again, while some were supposing that the other hand was wanting, permitting them to remain a short time in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> afterward he turned back the cloak on the other side and exposed the other hand. Then addressing himself to those present, he said, 'Arsenius, as you see, is found to have two hands: let my accusers show the place whence the third was cut off.'  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 30. Athanasius is found Innocent of what he was accused; his Accusers take to Flight.</h2>

<p>Matters having been brought to this issue with regard to Arsenius, the contrivers of this imposture were reduced to perplexity; and Achab,  who was also called John, one of the principal accusers, having slipped out of court in the tumult, effected his escape. Thus Athanasius cleared himself from this charge, without having recourse to any pleading;  for he was confident that the sight only of Arsenius alive would confound his <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a>.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 31. When the Bishops will not listen to Athanasius' Defense on the Second Charge, he betakes himself to the Emperor.</h2>

<p>But in refuting the false allegations against Macarius, he made use of legal forms; taking exception in the first place to Eusebius and his party, as his enemies, protesting against the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of any man's being tried by his adversaries. He next insisted on its being <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that his accuser Ischyras had really obtained the dignity of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>; for so he had been designated in the indictment. But as the judges would not allow any of these objections, the case of Macarius was entered into, and the informers being found deficient of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, the hearing of the matter was postponed, until some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should have gone into Mareotis, in order that all doubtful points might be examined on the spot. Athanasius seeing that those very individuals were to be sent to whom he had taken exception (for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> sent were Theognis, Maris, Theodorus, Macedonius, Valens, and Ursacius), exclaimed that 'their procedure was both treacherous and fraudulent; for that it was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Macarius should be detained in bonds, while the accuser together with the judges who were his adversaries, were permitted to go, in order that an <em>ex parte</em> collection of the facts in evidence might be made.' Having made this protest before the whole Synod and Dionysius the governor of the province, and finding that no one paid any attention to his appeal, he privately withdrew. Those, therefore, who were sent to Mareotis, having made an <em>ex parte</em>  investigation, held that what the accuser said was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 32. On the Departure of Athanasius, those who composed the Synod vote his Deposition.</h2>

<p>Thus Athanasius departed, hastening to the emperor, and the Synod in the first place condemned him in his absence; and when the result of the enquiry which had been instituted at Mareotis was presented, they voted to depose him; loading him with opprobrious epithets in their sentence of deposition, but being wholly silent respecting the disgraceful defeat of the charge of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> brought by his <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a>. They moreover received into communion Arsenius,  who was reported to have been murdered; and he who had formerly been a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Melitian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> subscribed to the deposition of Athanasius as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Hypselopolis. Thus by an extraordinary course of circumstances, the alleged victim of assassination by Athanasius, was found alive to assist in deposing him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33. The Members of the Synod proceed from Tyre to Jerusalem, and having celebrated the Dedication of the 'New Jerusalem,' receive Arius and his Followers into Communion.</h2>

<p>Letters in the meantime were brought from the emperor directing those who composed the Synod to hasten to the <em>New Jerusalem:</em>  having therefore immediately left <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, they set forward with all dispatch to Jerusalem, where, after celebrating a festival in connection with the consecration of the place, they readmitted <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>  and his adherents into communion, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, as they said, to the wishes of the emperor, who had signified in his communication to them, that he was fully satisfied respecting the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Euzo&iuml;us. They moreover wrote to the church at Alexandria,  stating that all <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> being now banished, the affairs of the church were established in peace: and that since <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> had by his recantation acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it was but just that, being thenceforth a member of the church, he should also be henceforth received by them, alluding to the banishment of Athanasius [in their statement that 'all <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> was now banished']. At the same time they sent information of what had been done to the emperor, in terms nearly to the same effect. But while the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were engaged in these transactions, other letters came unexpectedly from the emperor, intimating that Athanasius had fled to him for protection; and that it was necessary for them on his account to come to Constantinople. This unanticipated communication from the emperor was as follows.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 34. The Emperor summons the Synod to himself by Letter, in order that the Charges against Athanasius might be carefully examined before him.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus,</span> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> convened at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>.</p>

<p>I am indeed <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the decisions which have been made by your Council with so much turbulence and storm: but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> seems to have been perverted by some tumultuous and disorderly proceedings: because, that is to say, in your mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of contention, which you seem desirous of perpetuating, you disregard the consideration of those things which are acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It will, however, I trust, be the work of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> to dissipate the mischiefs resulting from this jealous rivalry, as soon as they shall have been detected; and to make it apparent to us, whether ye who have been convened have had regard to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and whether your decisions on the subjects which have been submitted to your judgment have been made apart from partiality or prejudice. Wherefore it is indispensable that you should all without delay attend upon my <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, that you may yourselves give a strict account of your transactions. For what reason I have deemed it proper to write thus, and to summon you before me, you will learn from what follows. As I was making my entry into the city which bears our name, in this our most flourishing home, Constantinople,&mdash; and it happened that I was riding on horseback at the time,&mdash; suddenly the Bishop Athanasius, with certain ecclesiastics whom he had around him, presented himself so unexpectedly in our path, as to produce an occasion of consternation. For the Omniscient God is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that at first sight I did not recognize him until some of my attendants, in answer to my enquiry, informed me, as was very natural, both who he was, and what <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> he had suffered. At that time indeed I neither conversed, nor held any communication with him. But as he repeatedly entreated an audience, and I had not only refused it, but almost ordered that he should be removed from my presence, he said with greater boldness, that he petitioned for nothing more than that you might be summoned hither, in order that in our presence, he, driven by necessity to such a course, might have a fair opportunity afforded him of complaining of his wrongs. Wherefore as this seems reasonable, and consistent with the equity of my government, I willingly gave instructions that these things should be written to you. My command therefore is, that all, as many as composed the Synod convened at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, should immediately hasten to the court of our clemency, in order that from the facts themselves you may make clear the purity and integrity of your decision in my presence, whom you cannot but own to be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is in consequence of the acts of my religious service towards God that peace is everywhere reigning; and that the name of God is sincerely had in reverence even among the barbarians  themselves, who until now were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now it is evident that he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, does not have a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God also: yet, as I before said even the barbarians on my account, who am a genuine servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have acknowledged and learned to worship him, whom they have perceived in very deed protecting and caring for me everywhere. So that from dread of us chiefly, they have been thus brought to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God whom they now worship. Nevertheless we who pretend to have a religious veneration for (I will not say who guard) the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of his church, we, I say, do nothing but what tends to discord and animosity, and to speak plainly, to the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. But hasten, as I have already said, all of you to us as speedily as possible: and be assured that I shall endeavor with all my power to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that what is contained in the Divine Law may be preserved inviolate, on which neither stigma nor reproach shall be able to fasten itself; and this will come to pass when its enemies, who under cover of the sacred profession introduce numerous and diversified <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, are dispersed, broken to pieces, and altogether annihilated.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35. The Synod not having come to the Emperor, the Partisans of Eusebius accuse Athanasius of having threatened to divert the Corn supplied to Constantinople from Alexandria: the Emperor being exasperated at this banishes Athanasius into Gaul. </h2>

<p>This letter rendered those who constituted the Synod very fearful, wherefore most of them returned to their respective cities. But Eusebius, Theognis, Maris, Patrophilus, Ursacius, and Valens, having gone to Constantinople, would not permit any further enquiry to be instituted concerning the broken cup, the overturned communion table, and the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Arsenius; but they had recourse to another <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, informing the emperor that Athanasius had threatened to prohibit the sending of grain which was usually conveyed from <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> to Constantinople. They affirmed also that these menaces were heard from the lips of Athanasius by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Adamantius, Anubion, Arbathion and Peter, for <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> is most prevalent when of the assertor of it appears to be a person worthy of credit. Hence the emperor being deceived, and excited to indignation against Athanasius by this charge, at once condemned him to exile, ordering him to reside in the Gauls. Now some affirm that the emperor came to this decision with a view to the establishment of unity in the church, since Athanasius was inexorable in his refusal to hold any communion with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his adherents. He accordingly took up his abode at Treves, a city of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36. Of Marcellus Bishop of Ancyra, and Asterius the Sophist.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled at Constantinople deposed also Marcellus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ancyra, a city of Galatia Minor, on this account. A certain rhetorician of Cappadocia named Asterius having abandoned his art, and professed himself a <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, undertook the composition of some treatises, which are still extant, in which he commended the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>; asserting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the same sense as the locust and the palmer-worm are said by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to be the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note260253"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse25">Joel&nbsp;2:25</a></span> with other similar utterances. Now Asterius was in constant association with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and especially with those of their number who did not discountenance the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> doctrine: he also attended their Synods, in the hope of insinuating himself into the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> of some city: but he failed to obtain ordination, in consequence of having <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.  Going therefore throughout the cities of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, he read in public the books which he had composed. Marcellus being informed of this, and wishing to counteract his influence, in his over-anxiety to confute him, fell into the diametrically opposite <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; for he dared to say, as the Samosatene  had done, that Christ was a mere man. When the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> then convened at Jerusalem had intelligence of these things, they took no notice of Asterius, because he was not enrolled even in the catalogue of ordained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; but they insisted that Marcellus, as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, should give an account of the book which he had written. Finding that he entertained <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata's</a> sentiments, they required him to retract his opinion; and he being thoroughly ashamed of himself, promised to burn his book. But the convention of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> being hastily dissolved by the emperor's summoning them to Constantinople, the Eusebians on their arrival at that city, again took the case of Marcellus into consideration; and as Marcellus refused to fulfil his promise of burning his untimely book, those present deposed him, and sent Basil into Ancyra in his stead. Moreover Eusebius wrote a refutation of this work in three books, in which he exposed its erroneous doctrine. Marcellus however was afterwards reinstated  in his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> by the Synod at Sardica, on his assurance that his book had been misunderstood, and that on that account he was supposed to favor the Samosatene's views. But of this we shall speak more fully in its proper place.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 37. After the Banishment of Athanasius, Ariushaving been sent for by the Emperor, raises a Disturbance against Alexander Bishop of Constantinople.</h2>

<p>While these things were taking place, the thirtieth year of Constantine's reign was completed. But <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> with his adherents having returned to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, again disturbed the whole city; for the people of Alexandria were exceedingly indignant both at the restoration of this incorrigible <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> with his partisans, and also because their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Athanasius had been sent to exile. When the emperor was apprised of the perverse disposition of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, he once more ordered him to repair to Constantinople, to give an account of the commotions he had afresh endeavored to excite. It happened at that time that Alexander, who had some time before succeeded Metrophanes, presided over the church at Constantinople. That this prelate was a man of devoted <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was distinctly manifested by the conflict he entered into with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>; for when <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> arrived and the people were divided into two factions and the whole city was thrown into confusion: some insisting that the Nicene Creed should be by no means infringed on, while others contended that the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> was consonant to reason. In this state of affairs, Alexander was driven to straits: more especially since Eusebius of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> had violently threatened that he would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> him to be immediately deposed, unless he admitted <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his followers to communion. Alexander, however, was far less troubled at the thought of his own deposition as fearful of the subversion of the principles of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which they were so anxious to effect: and regarding himself as the constituted guardian of the doctrines recognized, and the decisions made by the council at Nic&aelig;a, he exerted himself to the utmost to prevent their being violated or depraved. Reduced to this extremity, he bade farewell to all <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> resources, and made God his refuge, devoting himself to continued <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and never ceased from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>. Communicating his purpose to no one, he shut himself up alone in the church called <em>Irene:</em> there going up to the altar, and prostrating himself on the ground beneath the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> communion table, he poured forth his fervent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> weeping; and this he ceased not to do for many successive nights and days. What he thus earnestly asked from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he received: for his petition was such a one: 'If the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> were correct, he might not be permitted to see the day appointed for its discussion; but that if he himself held the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, as the author of all these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, might suffer the punishment due to his impiety.'</p>

<h2>Chapter 38. The Death of Arius. </h2>

<p>Such was the supplication of Alexander. Meanwhile the emperor, being desirous of personally examining <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, sent for him to the palace, and asked him whether he would assent to the determinations of the Synod at Nic&aelig;a. He without hesitation replied in the affirmative, and subscribed the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the emperor's presence, acting with duplicity. The emperor, surprised at his ready compliance, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to confirm his signature by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. This also he did with equal dissimulation. The way he evaded, as I have heard, was this: he wrote his own opinion on paper, and carried it under his arm, so that he then swore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> that he really held the sentiments he had written. That this is so, however, I have written from hearsay, but that he added an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to his subscription, I have myself ascertained, from an examination of the emperor's own letters. The emperor being thus convinced, ordered that he should be received into communion by Alexander, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople. It was then Saturday, and <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> was expecting to assemble with the church on the day following: but divine retribution overtook his daring criminalities. For going out of the imperial palace, attended by a crowd of Eusebian partisans like guards, he paraded proudly through the midst of the city, attracting the notice of all the people. As he approached the place called Constantine's Forum, where the column of porphyry is erected, a terror arising from the remorse of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> seized <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and with the terror a violent relaxation of the bowels: he therefore enquired whether there was a convenient place near, and being directed to the back of Constantine's Forum, he hastened there. Soon after a faintness came over him, and together with the evacuations his bowels protruded, followed by a copious hemorrhage, and the descent of the smaller intestines: moreover portions of his spleen and liver were brought off in the effusion of blood, so that he almost immediately died. The scene of this catastrophe still is shown at Constantinople, as I have said, behind the shambles in the colonnade: and by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> going by pointing the finger at the place, there is a perpetual remembrance preserved of this extraordinary kind of death. So disastrous an occurrence filled with dread and alarm the party of Eusebius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>; and the report of it quickly spread itself over the city and throughout the whole world. As the king grew more earnest in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and confessed that the confession at Nic&aelig;a was attested by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he rejoiced at the occurrences. He was also glad because of his three sons whom he had already proclaimed C&aelig;sars; one of each of them having been created at every successive decennial anniversary of his reign. To the eldest, whom he called Constantine, after his own name, he assigned the government of the western parts of the empire, on the completion of his first decade. His second son Constantius, who bore his grandfather's name, he constituted C&aelig;sar in the eastern division, when the second decade had been completed. And Constans, the youngest, he invested with a similar dignity, in the thirtieth year of his own reign.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39. The Emperor falls sick and dies.</h2>

<p>A year having passed, the Emperor Constantine having just entered the sixty-fifth year of his age, was taken with a sickness; he therefore left Constantinople, and made a voyage to Helenopolis, that he might try the effect of the medicinal hot springs which are found in the vicinity of that city. Perceiving, however, that his illness increased, he deferred the use of the baths; and removing from Helenopolis to <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, he took up his residence in the suburbs, and there received <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.  After this he became cheerful; and making his will, appointed his three sons heirs to the empire, allotting to each one of them his portion, in accordance with the arrangements he had made while living. He also granted many privileges to the cities of Rome and Constantinople; and entrusting the custody of his will  to that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> by whose means <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> had been recalled, and of whom we have already made mention, he charged him to deliver it into no one's hand, except that of his son Constantius, to whom he had given the sovereignty of the East. After the making of his will, he survived a few days and died. Of his sons none were present at his death. A courier was therefore immediately dispatched into the East, to inform Constantius of his father's decease.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 40. The Funeral of the Emperor Constantine.</h2>

<p>The body of the emperor was placed in a coffin of gold by the proper <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and then conveyed to Constantinople, where it was laid out on an elevated bed of state in the palace, surrounded by a guard, and treated with the same respect as when he was alive, and this was done until the arrival of one of his sons. When Constantius had come out of the eastern parts of the empire, it was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with an imperial sepulture, and deposited in the church called <em>The Apostles:</em> which he had caused to be constructed for this very purpose, that the emperors and prelates might receive a degree of veneration but little inferior to that which was paid to the relics of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. The Emperor Constantine lived sixty-five years, and reigned thirty-one. He died in the consulate of Felician and <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, on the twenty-second of May, in the second year of the 278th Olympiad.  This book, therefore, embraces a period of thirty-one years.<br> <br></p>
