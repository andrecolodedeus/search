<h1>Church History (Book VI)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. The Persecution under Severus.</h2>

<p>When Severus began to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>,  <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> testimonies were given everywhere by the athletes of religion. This was especially the case in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, to which city, as to a most prominent theater, athletes of God were brought from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and all Thebais according to their merit, and won crowns from God through their great patience under many tortures and every mode of death. Among these was Leonides, who was called the father of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>,  and who was beheaded while his son was still young. How remarkable the predilection of this son was for the Divine Word, in consequence of his father's instruction, it will not be amiss to state briefly, as his fame has been very greatly celebrated by many.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The Training of Origenfrom Childhood.</h2> 

<p>1. Many things might be said in attempting to describe the life of the man while in school; but this subject alone would require a separate treatise. Nevertheless, for the present, abridging most things, we shall state a few facts concerning him as briefly as possible, gathering them from certain letters, and from the statement of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> still living who were acquainted with him.</p>

<p>2. What they report of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> seems to me worthy of mention, even, so to speak, from his swathing-bands.</p>

<p>It was the tenth year of the reign of Severus, while L&aelig;tus  was governor of Alexandria and the rest of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and Demetrius  had lately received the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of the parishes there, as successor of Julian. </p>

<p>3. As the flame of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> had been kindled greatly,  and multitudes had gained the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, such desire for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> seized the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, although yet a boy, that he went close to danger, springing forward and rushing to the conflict in his eagerness.</p>

<p>4. And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the termination of his life had been very near had not the divine and heavenly Providence, for the benefit of many, prevented his desire through the agency of his mother.</p>

<p>5. For, at first, entreating him, she begged him to have compassion on her motherly feelings toward him; but finding, that when he had learned that his father had been seized and imprisoned, he was set the more resolutely, and completely carried away with his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, she hid all his clothing, and thus compelled him to remain at home.</p>

<p>6. But, as there was nothing else that he could do, and his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> beyond his age would not suffer him to be quiet, he sent to his father an encouraging letter on <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>,  in which he exhorted him, saying, <q>Take heed not to change your mind on our account.</q> This may be recorded as the first evidence of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> youthful wisdom and of his genuine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.</p>

<p>7. For even then he had stored up no small resources in the words of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, having been trained in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> from childhood. And he had not studied them with indifference, for his father, besides giving him the usual liberal education,  had made them a matter of no secondary importance.</p>

<p>8. First of all, before inducting him into the Greek sciences, he drilled him in sacred studies, requiring him to learn and recite every day.</p>

<p>9. Nor was this irksome to the boy, but he was eager and diligent in these studies. And he was not satisfied with learning what was simple and obvious in the sacred words, but sought for something more, and even at that age busied himself with deeper speculations. So that he puzzled his father with inquiries for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of the inspired Scriptures.</p>

<p>10. And his father rebuked him seemingly to his face, telling him not to search beyond his age, or further than the manifest meaning. But by himself he rejoiced greatly and thanked <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the author of all good, that he had deemed him worthy to be the father of such a child.</p>

<p>11. And they say that often, standing by the boy when asleep, he uncovered his breast as if the Divine Spirit were enshrined within it, and kissed it reverently; considering himself <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in his goodly offspring. These and other things like them are related of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> when a boy.</p>

<p>12. But when his father ended his life in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, he was left with his mother and six younger brothers when he was not quite seventeen years old. </p>

<p>13. And the property of his father being confiscated to the royal treasury, he and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were in want of the necessaries of life. But he was deemed worthy of Divine care. And he found welcome and rest with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and distinguished in her manner of life and in other respects. She was treating with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> a famous <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> then in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>;  who, however, was born in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. He was with her as an adopted son, and she treated him with the greatest kindness.</p>

<p>14. But although <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of associating with him, he nevertheless gave from this time on strong evidences of his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For when on account of the apparent skill in argument  of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>&mdash;for this was the man's name&mdash;a great multitude came to him, not only of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> but also of our people, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> could never be induced to join with him in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>;  for he held, although a boy, the rule of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,  and abominated, as he somewhere expresses it, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teachings.  Having been instructed in the sciences of the Greeks by his father, he devoted him after his death more assiduously and exclusively to the study of literature, so that he obtained considerable preparation in philology  and was able not long after the death of his father, by devoting himself to that subject, to earn a compensation amply sufficient for his needs at his age. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. While still very Young, he taught diligently the Word of Christ.</h2>

<p>1. But while he was lecturing in the school, as he tells us himself, and there was no one at Alexandria to give instruction in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as all were driven away by the threat of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, some of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> came to him to hear the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. The first of them, he says, was Plutarch,  who after living well, was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with divine <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. The second was Heraclas,  a brother of Plutarch; who after he too had given with him abundant evidence of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> and <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> life, was esteemed worthy to succeed Demetrius in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> of Alexandria.</p>

<p>3. He was in his eighteenth year when he took charge of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> school.  He was prominent also at this time, during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> under Aquila,  the governor of Alexandria, when his name became celebrated among the leaders in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, through the kindness and goodwill which he manifested toward all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him or strangers.</p>

<p>4. For not only was he with them while in bonds, and until their final condemnation, but when the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were led to death, he was very bold and went with them into danger. So that as he acted bravely, and with great boldness saluted the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, oftentimes the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> multitude round about them became infuriated, and were on the point of rushing upon him.</p>

<p>5. But through the helping hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he escaped absolutely and marvelously. And this same divine and heavenly power, again and again, it is impossible to say how often, on account of his great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and boldness for the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, guarded him when thus endangered.  So great was the enmity of the unbelievers toward him, on account of the multitude that were instructed by him in the sacred <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that they placed bands of soldiers around the house where he abode.</p>

<p>6. Thus day by day the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> burned against him, so that the whole city could no longer contain him; but he removed from house to house and was driven in every direction because of the multitude who attended upon the divine instruction which he gave. For his life also exhibited right and admirable conduct according to the practice of genuine <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>7. For they say that his manner of life was as his doctrine, and his doctrine as his life.  Therefore, by the divine Power working with him he aroused a great many to his own <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>.</p>

<p>8. But when he saw yet more coming to him for instruction, and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> school had been entrusted to him alone by Demetrius, who presided over the church, he considered the teaching of grammatical science inconsistent with training in divine subjects,  and immediately he gave up his grammatical school as unprofitable and a hindrance to sacred learning.</p>

<p>9. Then, with becoming consideration, that he might not need aid from others, he disposed of whatever valuable books of ancient literature he possessed, being satisfied with receiving from the purchaser four oboli a day.  For many years he lived philosophically  in this manner, putting away all the incentives of youthful desires. Through the entire day he endured no small amount of discipline; and for the greater part of the night he gave himself to the study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>. He restrained himself as much as possible by a most <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> life; sometimes by the discipline of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, again by limited time for sleep. And in his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he never lay upon a bed, but upon the ground.</p>

<p>10. Most of all, he thought that the words of the Saviour in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> should be observed, in which he exhorts not to have two coats nor to use shoes  nor to occupy oneself with cares for the future. </p>

<p>11. With a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> beyond his age he continued in cold and nakedness; and, going to the very extreme of poverty, he greatly astonished those about him. And indeed he grieved many of his friends who desired to share their possessions with him, on account of the wearisome toil which they saw him enduring in the teaching of divine things.</p>

<p>12. But he did not relax his perseverance. He is said to have walked for a number of years never wearing a shoe, and, for a great many years, to have abstained from the use of wine, and of all other things beyond his necessary food; so that he was in danger of breaking down and destroying his constitution. </p>

<p>13. By giving such evidences of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> life to those who saw him, he aroused many of his pupils to similar <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; so that prominent men even of the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and men that followed learning and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> were led to his instruction. Some of them having received from him into the depth of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Divine Word, became prominent in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> then prevailing; and some of them were seized and suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The pupils of Origenthat became Martyrs.</h2>

<p>1. The first of these was Plutarch, who was mentioned just above.  As he was led to death, the man of whom we are speaking being with him at the end of his life, came near being slain by his fellow citizens, as if he were the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his death. But the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God preserved him at this time also.</p>

<p>2. After Plutarch, the second <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> among the pupils of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was Serenus,  who gave through fire a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he had received.</p>

<p>3. The third <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> from the same school was Heraclides,  and after him the fourth was Hero.  The former of these was as yet a catechumen, and the latter had but recently been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Both of them were beheaded. After them, the fifth from the same school proclaimed as an athlete of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was another Serenus, who, it is reported, was beheaded, after a long endurance of tortures. And of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, Herais  died while yet a catechumen, receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by fire, as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> himself somewhere says.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Potami&aelig;na.</h2> 

<p>1. <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> </span> may be counted the seventh of these. He led to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> the celebrated Potami&aelig;na, who is still famous among the people of the country for the many things which she endured for the preservation of her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. For she was blooming in the perfection of her mind and her physical graces. Having suffered much for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, finally after tortures dreadful and terrible to speak of, she with her mother, Marcella,  was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by fire.</p>

<p>2. They say that the judge, Aquila by name, having inflicted severe tortures upon her entire body, at last threatened to hand her over to the gladiators for bodily abuse. After a little consideration, being asked for her decision, she made a reply which was regarded as impious.</p>

<p>3. Thereupon she received sentence immediately, and <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, one of the officers of the army, led her to death. But as the people attempted to annoy and insult her with abusive words, he drove back her insulters, showing her much pity and kindness. And perceiving the man's sympathy for her, she exhorted him to be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, for she would supplicate her Lord for him after her departure, and he would soon receive a reward for the kindness he had shown her.</p>

<p>4. Having said this, she nobly sustained the issue, burning pitch being poured little by little, over various parts of her body, from the sole of her feet to the crown of her head. Such was the conflict endured by this famous maiden.</p>

<p>5. Not long after this <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, being asked by his fellow-soldiers to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> for a certain reason, declared that it was not lawful for him to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> at all, for he was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and he confessed this openly. At first they thought that he was jesting, but when he continued to affirm it, he was led to the judge, and, acknowledging his conviction before him, he was imprisoned. But the brethren in God coming to him and inquiring the reason of this sudden and remarkable resolution, he is reported to have said that Potami&aelig;na, for three days after her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, stood beside him by night and placed a crown on his head and said that she had besought the Lord for him and had obtained what she asked, and that soon she would take him with her.</p>

<p>6. Thereupon the brethren gave him the seal  of the Lord; and on the next day, after giving <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> testimony for the Lord, he was beheaded. And many others in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> are recorded to have accepted speedily the word of Christ in those times.</p>

<p>7. For Potami&aelig;na appeared to them in their dreams and exhorted them. But let this suffice in regard to this matter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Clement of Alexandria.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Clement </span> having succeeded Pant&aelig;nus,  had charge at that time of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, so that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> also, while still a boy,  was one of his pupils. In the first book of the work called Stromata, which Clement wrote, he gives a chronological table,  bringing events down to the death of Commodus. So it is evident that that work was written during the reign of Severus, whose times we are now recording.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Writer, Judas.</h2> 

<p>At this time another writer, Judas, discoursing about the seventy weeks in Daniel, brings down the chronology to the tenth year of the reign of Severus. He thought that the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, which was much talked about, was then near.  So greatly did the agitation caused by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of our people at this time disturb the minds of many.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Origen's Daring Deed.</h2>

<p>1. At this time while <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was conducting <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction at Alexandria, a deed was done by him which evidenced an immature and youthful <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but at the same time gave the highest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and continence.  For he took the words, <q>There are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven's</a> sake,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note251810"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;19:12</a></span> in too literal and extreme a sense. And in order to fulfill the Saviour's word, and at the same time to take away from the unbelievers all opportunity for scandal,&mdash; for, although young, he met for the study of divine things with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as well as men,&mdash; he carried out in action the word of the Saviour.</p>

<p>2. He thought that this would not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by many of his acquaintances. But it was impossible for him, though desiring to do so, to keep such an action secret.</p>

<p>3. When Demetrius, who presided over that parish, at last learned of this, he admired greatly the daring nature of the act, and as he perceived his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and the genuineness of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he immediately exhorted him to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and urged him the more to continue his work of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction.</p>

<p>4. Such was he at that time. But soon afterward, seeing that he was prospering, and becoming great and distinguished among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the same Demetrius, overcome by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, wrote of his deed as most foolish to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> throughout the world. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Cesarea and Jerusalem, who were especially notable and distinguished among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Palestine, considering <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> worthy in the highest degree of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, ordained him a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. </p>

<p>5. Thereupon his fame increased greatly, and his name became renowned everywhere, and he obtained no small <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and wisdom. But Demetrius, having nothing else that he could say against him, save this deed of his boyhood, accused him bitterly,  and dared to include with him in these accusations those who had raised him to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbyterate</a>.</p>

<p>6. These things, however, took place a little later. But at this time <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> continued fearlessly the instruction in divine things at Alexandria by day and night to all who came to him; devoting his entire leisure without cessation to divine studies and to his pupils.</p>

<p>7. Severus, having held the government for eighteen years, was succeeded by his son, Antoninus.  Among those who had endured courageously the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of that time, and had been preserved by the Providence of God through the conflicts of confession, was Alexander, of whom we have spoken already  as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church in Jerusalem. On account of his pre-eminence in the confession of Christ he was thought worthy of that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>, while Narcissus,  his predecessor, was still living.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The Miracles of Narcissus.</h2>

<p>1. The citizens of that parish mention many other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of Narcissus, on the tradition of the brethren who succeeded him; among which they relate the following wonder as performed by him.</p>

<p>2. They say that the oil once failed while the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were watching through the night at the great paschal vigil. Thereupon the whole multitude being dismayed, Narcissus directed those who attended to the lights, to draw water and bring it to him.</p>

<p>3. This being immediately done he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> over the water, and with firm <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, commanded them to pour it into the lamps. And when they had done so, contrary to all expectation by a wonderful and divine power, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the water was changed into that of oil. A small portion of it has been preserved even to our day by many of the brethren there as a memento of the wonder. </p>

<p>4. They tell many other things worthy to be noted of the life of this man, among which is this. Certain base men being unable to endure the strength and firmness of his life, and fearing punishment for the many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> of which they were conscious, sought by plotting to anticipate him, and circulated a terrible <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> against him.</p>

<p>5. And to persuade those who heard of it, they confirmed their accusations with oaths: one invoked upon himself destruction by fire; another the wasting of his body by a foul disease; the third the loss of his eyes. But though they swore in this manner, they could not affect the mind of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>; because the continence and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life of Narcissus were well known to all.</p>

<p>6. But he could not in any wise endure the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of these men; and as he had followed a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a>  life for a long time, he fled from the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and hid himself in desert and secret places, and remained there many years. </p>

<p>7. But the great eye of judgment was not unmoved by these things, but soon looked down upon these impious men, and brought on them the curses with which they had bound themselves. The residence of the first, from nothing but a little spark falling upon it, was entirely consumed by night, and he perished with all his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The second was speedily covered with the disease which he had imprecated upon himself, from the sole of his feet to his head.</p>

<p>8. But the third, perceiving what had happened to the others, and fearing the inevitable judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the ruler of all, confessed publicly what they had plotted together. And in his repentance he became so wasted by his great lamentations, and continued weeping to such an extent, that both his eyes were destroyed. Such were the punishments which these men received for their <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. The Bishops of Jerusalem.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Narcissus</span> having departed, and no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> where he was, those presiding over the neighboring churches thought it best to ordain another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. His name was Dius.  He presided but a short time, and Germanio succeeded him. He was followed by Gordius,  in whose time Narcissus appeared again, as if raised from the dead.  And immediately the brethren besought him to take the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, as all admired him the more on account of his retirement and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and especially because of the punishment with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had avenged him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Alexander.</h2>

<p>1. But as on account of his great age Narcissus was no longer able to perform his official duties,  the Providence of God called to the office with him, by a revelation given him in a night vision, the above-mentioned Alexander, who was then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of another parish. </p>

<p>2. Thereupon, as by Divine direction, he journeyed from the land of Cappadocia, where he first held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, to Jerusalem, in consequence of a vow and for the sake of information in regard to its places.  They received him there with great cordiality, and would not permit him to return, because of another revelation seen by them at night, which uttered the clearest message to the most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> among them. For it made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that if they would go outside the gates, they would receive the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> foreordained for them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And having done this, with the unanimous consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the neighboring churches, they constrained him to remain.</p>

<p>3. Alexander, himself, in private letters to the Antinoites,  which are still preserved among us, mentions the joint <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of Narcissus and himself, writing in these words at the end of the epistle:</p>

<p>4. <q>Narcissus salutes you, who held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> here before me, and is now associated with me in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, being one hundred and sixteen years of age; and he exhorts you, as I do, to be of one mind.</q></p>

<p>These things took place in this manner. But, on the death of Serapion,  Asclepiades,  who had been himself distinguished among the confessors  during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of the church at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. Alexander alludes to his appointment, writing thus to the church at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>:</p>

<p>5. <q>Alexander, a servant and prisoner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, to the blessed <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">church of Antioch</a>, greeting in the Lord. The Lord has made my bonds during the time of my imprisonment light and easy, since I learned that, by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, Asclepiades, who in regard to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is eminently qualified, has undertaken the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> church at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</q></p>

<p>6. He indicates that he sent this epistle by Clement,  writing toward its close as follows:</p>

<p><q>My <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> brethren,  I have sent this letter to you by Clement, the blessed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, a man <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and approved, whom you yourselves also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and will recognize. Being here, in the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and oversight of the Master, he has strengthened and built up the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Serapion and his Extant Works.</h2>

<p>1. It is probable that others have preserved other memorials of Serapion's  literary industry,  but there have reached us only those addressed to a certain Domninus, who, in the time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, fell away from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Christ to the Jewish will-worship;  and those addressed to Pontius and Caricus,  <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> men, and other letters to different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and still another work composed by him on the so-called <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Peter. </p>

<p>2. He wrote this last to refute the falsehoods which that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> contained, on account of some in the parish of Rhossus  who had been led astray by it into heterodox notions. It may be well to give some brief extracts from his work, showing his opinion of the book. He writes as follows:</p>

<p>3. For we, brethren, receive both Peter and the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> as Christ; but we reject intelligently the writings <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to them, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that such were not handed down to us.</p>

<p>4. When I visited you I supposed that all of you held the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and as I had not read the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which they put forward under the name of Peter, I said, If this is the only thing which occasions dispute among you, let it be read. But now having learned, from what has been told me, that their mind was involved in some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, I will hasten to come to you again. Therefore, brethren, expect me shortly.</p>

<p>5. But you will learn, brethren, from what has been written to you, that we perceived the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Marcianus,  and that, not understanding what he was saying, he contradicted himself.</p>

<p>6. For having obtained this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> from others who had studied it diligently, namely, from the successors of those who first used it, whom we call Docet&aelig;  (for most of their opinions are connected with the teaching of that school ) we have been able to read it through, and we find many things in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, but some things added to that doctrine, which we have pointed out for you farther on. So much in regard to Serapion.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. The Writings of Clement.</h2> 

<p>1. All the eight Stromata of Clement are preserved among us, and have been given by him the following title: <q>Titus Flavius Clement's Stromata of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Notes on the True Philosophy.</q> </p>

<p>2. The books entitled Hypotyposes  are of the same number. In them he mentions Pant&aelig;nus  by name as his teacher, and gives his opinions and traditions.</p>

<p>3. Besides these there is his Hortatory Discourse addressed to the Greeks;  three books of a work entitled the Instructor;  another with the title What Rich Man is Saved?  the work on the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>;  discussions on Fasting and on Evil Speaking;  the Hortatory Discourse on Patience, or To Those Recently Baptized;  and the one bearing the title Ecclesiastical Canon, or Against the Judaizers,  which he dedicated to Alexander, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> mentioned above.</p>

<p>4. In the Stromata, he has not only treated extensively  of the Divine Scripture, but he also quotes from the Greek writers whenever anything that they have said seems to him profitable.</p>

<p>5. He elucidates the opinions of many, both Greeks and barbarians. He also refutes the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> of the heresiarchs, and besides this, reviews a large portion of history, giving us specimens of very various learning; with all the rest he mingles the views of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. It is likely that on this account he gave his work the appropriate title of Stromata. </p>

<p>6. He makes use also in these works of testimonies from the disputed Scriptures,  the so-called Wisdom of Solomon,  and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the son of Sirach, and the Epistle to the Hebrews,  and those of Barnabas,  and Clement  and Jude. </p>

<p>7. He mentions also <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>'s  Discourse to the Greeks, and speaks of Cassianus  as the author of a chronological work. He refers to the Jewish authors <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>,  Aristobulus,  <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>,  Demetrius,  and Eupolemus,  as showing, all of them, in their works, that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the Jewish race <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the earliest origin of the Greeks.</p>

<p>8. These books abound also in much other learning. In the first of them  the author speaks of himself as next after the successors of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>

<p>9. In them he promises also to write a commentary on Genesis.  In his book on the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>  he acknowledges that he had been urged by his friends to commit to writing, for posterity, the traditions which he had heard from the ancient <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>; and in the same work he mentions <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">Melito</a> and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, and certain others, and gives extracts from their writings.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. The Scriptures mentioned by Him.</h2>

<p>1. To sum up briefly, he has given in the Hypotyposes  abridged accounts of all canonical Scripture, not omitting the disputed books, &mdash; I refer to Jude and the other <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic epistles</a>, and Barnabas  and the so-called Apocalypse of Peter. </p>

<p>2. He says that the Epistle to the Hebrews  is the work of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and that it was written to the Hebrews in the Hebrew language; but that Luke translated it carefully and published it for the Greeks, and hence the same style of expression is found in this epistle and in the Acts.</p>

<p>3. But he says that the words, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Apostle, were probably not prefixed, because, in sending it to the Hebrews, who were prejudiced and suspicious of him, he wisely did not wish to repel them at the very beginning by giving his name.</p>

<p>4. Farther on he says: <q>But now, as the blessed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> said, since the Lord being the apostle of the Almighty, was sent to the Hebrews, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, as sent to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, on account of his modesty did not subscribe himself an apostle of the Hebrews, through respect for the Lord, and because being a herald and apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> he wrote to the Hebrews out of his superabundance.</q></p>

<p>5. Again, in the same books, Clement gives the tradition of the earliest <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, as to the order of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, in the following manner:</p>

<p>6. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> containing the genealogies, he says, were written first. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Mark  had this occasion. As Peter had preached the Word publicly at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and declared the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, many who were present requested that Mark, who had followed him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out. And having composed the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> he gave it to those who had requested it.</p>

<p>7. When Peter learned of this, he neither directly forbade nor encouraged it. But, last of all, John, perceiving that the external  facts had been made plain in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, being urged by his friends, and inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, composed a spiritual <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.  This is the account of Clement.</p>

<p>8. Again the above-mentioned Alexander,  in a certain letter to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, refers to Clement, and at the same time to Pant&aelig;nus, as being among his familiar acquaintances. He writes as follows:</p>

<p>For this, as you know, was the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the ancestral friendship existing between us should remain unshaken; nay, rather should be warmer and stronger.</p>

<p>9. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well those blessed fathers who have trodden the way before us, with whom we shall soon be;  Pant&aelig;nus, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed man and master, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Clement, my master and benefactor, and if there is any other like them, through whom I became acquainted with you, the best in everything, my master and brother. </p>

<p>10. So much for these matters. But Adamantius, &mdash; for this also was a name of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>&mdash;when <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a>  was <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, visited Rome, <q>desiring,</q> as he himself somewhere says, <q>to see the most ancient church of Rome.</q></p>

<p>11. After a short stay there he returned to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>. And he performed the duties of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction there with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; Demetrius, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> there at that time, urging and even entreating him to work diligently for the benefit of the brethren. </p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Heraclas.</h2> 

<p>1. But when he saw that he had not time for the deeper study of divine things, and for the investigation and interpretation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>, and also for the instruction of those who came to him&mdash;for coming, one after another, from morning till evening to be taught by him, they scarcely gave him time to breathe&mdash;he divided the multitude. And from those whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> well, he selected Heraclas, who was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> student of divine things, and in other respects a very learned man, not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and made him his associate in the work of instruction. He entrusted to him the elementary training of beginners, but reserved for himself the teaching of those who were farther advanced.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Origen's Earnest Study of the Divine Scriptures.</h2>

<p>1. So earnest and assiduous was <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> research into the divine words that he learned the Hebrew language,  and procured as his own the original Hebrew Scriptures which were in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. He investigated also the works of other translators of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> besides the Seventy.  And in addition to the well-known translations of Aquila,  Symmachus,  and Theodotion,  he discovered certain others which had been concealed from remote times&mdash;in what out-of-the-way corners I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not&mdash;and by his search he brought them to light. </p>

<p>2. Since he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the authors, he simply stated that he had found this one in Nicopolis near Actium  and that one in some other place.</p>

<p>3. In the Hexapla  of the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, after the four prominent translations, he adds not only a fifth, but also a sixth and seventh.  He states of one of these that he found it in a jar in <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> in the time of Antoninus, the son of Severus.</p>

<p>4. Having collected all of these, he divided them into sections, and placed them opposite each other, with the Hebrew text itself. He thus left us the copies of the so-called Hexapla. He arranged also separately an edition of Aquila and Symmachus and Theodotion with the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, in the Tetrapla. </p>

<h2>Chapter 17. The Translator Symmachus.</h2> 

<p>As to these translators it should be stated that Symmachus was an Ebionite. But the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, as it is called, asserts that Christ was the son of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, considering him a mere man, and insists strongly on keeping the law in a Jewish manner, as we have seen already in this history.  Commentaries of Symmachus are still extant in which he appears to support this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by attacking the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Matthew.  <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> states that he obtained these and other commentaries of Symmachus on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> from a certain Juliana,  who, he says, received the books by inheritance from Symmachus himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Ambrose.</h2>

<p>1. About this time Ambrose,  who held the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>,  was convinced by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> presentation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and, as if his mind were illumined by light, he accepted the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>2. Many others also, drawn by the fame of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> learning, which resounded everywhere, came to him to make trial of his skill in sacred literature. And a great many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and not a few of the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, studied under him diligently, receiving instruction from him not only in divine things, but also in secular <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>3. For when he perceived that any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> had superior intelligence he instructed them also in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> branches&mdash; in geometry, arithmetic, and other preparatory studies&mdash; and then advanced to the systems  of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and explained their writings. And he made observations and comments upon each of them, so that he became celebrated as a great <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> even among the Greeks themselves.</p>

<p>4. And he instructed many of the less learned in the common school branches,  saying that these would be no small help to them in the study and understanding of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>. On this account he considered it especially necessary for himself to be skilled in secular and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> learning. </p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Circumstances Related of Origen.</h2>

<p>1. The Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of his age are witnesses to his proficiency in these subjects. We find frequent mention of him in their writings. Sometimes they dedicated their own works to him; again, they submitted their labors to him as a teacher for his judgment.</p>

<p>2. Why need we say these things when even Porphyry,  who lived in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> in our own times and wrote books against us, attempting to traduce the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> by them, mentions those who have interpreted them; and being unable in any way to find a base accusation against the doctrines, for lack of arguments turns to reviling and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniating</a> their interpreters, attempting especially to <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, whom he says he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> in his youth.</p>

<p>3. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it, he commends the man; telling the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about him in some cases where he could not do otherwise; but uttering falsehoods where he thinks he will not be detected. Sometimes he accuses him as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; again he describes his proficiency in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> learning. But hear his own words:</p>

<p>4. <q>Some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, desiring to find a solution of the baseness of the Jewish Scriptures rather than abandon them, have had recourse to explanations inconsistent and incongruous with the words written, which explanations, instead of supplying a defense of the foreigners, contain rather approval and praise of themselves. For they boast that the plain words of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> are enigmas, and regard them as oracles full of hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; and having bewildered the mental judgment by folly, they make their explanations.</q> Farther on he says:</p>

<p>5. As an example of this absurdity take a man whom I met when I was young, and who was then greatly celebrated and still is, on account of the writings which he has left. I refer to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who is highly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by the teachers of these doctrines.</p>

<p>6. For this man, having been a hearer of Ammonius,  who had attained the greatest proficiency in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of any in our day, derived much benefit from his teacher in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the sciences; but as to the correct choice of life, he pursued a course opposite to his.</p>

<p>7. For Ammonius, being a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and brought up by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, when he gave himself to study and to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> straightway conformed to the life required by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. But <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, having been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> as a Greek in Greek literature, went over to the barbarian recklessness.  And carrying over the learning which he had obtained, he hawked it about, in his life conducting himself as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, but in his opinions of material things and of the Deity being like a Greek, and mingling Grecian teachings with foreign fables. </p>

<p>8. For he was continually studying <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and he busied himself with the writings of Numenius  and Cronius,  Apollophanes,  Longinus,  Moderatus,  and Nicomachus,  and those famous among the Pythagoreans. And he used the books of Ch&aelig;remon  the Stoic, and of Cornutus.  Becoming acquainted through them with the figurative interpretation of the Grecian <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, he applied it to the Jewish Scriptures. </p>

<p>9. These things are said by Porphyry in the third book of his work against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.  He speaks <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> of the industry and learning of the man, but plainly utters a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> (for what will not an opposer of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do?) when he says that he went over from the Greeks,  and that Ammonius fell from a life of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> into <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> customs.</p>

<p>10. For the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was taught to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, as we have shown above. And Ammonius held the divine <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> unshaken and unadulterated to the end of his life.  His works yet extant show this, as he is celebrated among many for the writings which he has left. For example, the work entitled The Harmony of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Jesus, and such others as are in the possession of the learned.</p>

<p>11. These things are sufficient to evince the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> of the false accuser, and also the proficiency of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in Grecian learning. He defends his diligence in this direction against some who blamed him for it, in a certain epistle,  where he writes as follows:</p>

<p>12. When I devoted myself to the word, and the fame of my proficiency went abroad, and when <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> conversant with Grecian learning, and particularly with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, came to me, it seemed necessary that I should examine the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and what the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> say concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>13. And in this we have followed Pant&aelig;nus,  who benefited many before our time by his thorough preparation in such things, and also Heraclas,  who is now a member of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a> of Alexandria. I found him with the teacher of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> learning, with whom he had already continued five years before I began to hear lectures on those subjects. </p>

<p>14. And though he had formerly worn the common dress, he laid it aside and assumed and still wears the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher's</a> garment;  and he continues the earnest investigation of Greek works.</p>

<p>He says these things in defending himself for his study of Grecian literature.</p>

<p>15. About this time, while he was still at Alexandria, a soldier came and delivered a letter from the governor of Arabia  to Demetrius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the parish, and to the prefect of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> who was in office at that time, requesting that they would with all speed send <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> to him for an interview. Being sent by them, he went to Arabia. And having in a short time accomplished the object of his visit, he returned to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>.</p>

<p>16. But sometime after a considerable <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out in the city,  and he departed from <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>. And thinking that it would be unsafe for him to remain in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, he went to Palestine and abode in C&aelig;sarea. While there the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the church in that country  requested him to preach and expound the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> publicly, although he had not yet been ordained as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. </p>

<p>17. This is evident  from what Alexander,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem and Theoctistus  of C&aelig;sarea, wrote to Demetrius  in regard to the matter, defending themselves thus:</p>

<p>He has stated in his letter that such a thing was never heard of before, neither has hitherto taken place, that <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> should preach in the presence of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how he comes to say what is plainly untrue.</p>

<p>18. For whenever <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> able to instruct the brethren are found, they are exhorted by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to preach to the people. Thus in Laranda, Euelpis by Neon; and in Iconium, <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus</a> by Celsus; and in Synada, Theodorus by Atticus, our blessed brethren.  And probably this has been done in other places unknown to us.</p>

<p>He was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> in this manner while yet a young man, not only by his countrymen, but also by foreign <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. </p>

<p>19. But Demetrius sent for him by letter, and urged him through members and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of the church to return to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>. So he returned and resumed his accustomed duties.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. The Extant Works of the Writers of that Age.</h2>

<p>1. There flourished many learned men in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at that time, whose letters to each other have been preserved and are easily accessible. They have been kept until our time in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="../cathen/08355a.htm">&AElig;lia</a>,  which was established by Alexander, who at that time presided over that church. We have been able to gather from that <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> material for our present work.</p>

<p>2. Among these Beryllus  has left us, besides letters and treatises, various elegant works. He was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Bostra in Arabia. Likewise also Hippolytus,  who presided over another church, has left writings.</p>

<p>3. There has reached us also a dialogue of Caius,  a very learned man, which was held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a>,  with Proclus, who contended for the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Phrygian heresy</a>. In this he curbs the rashness and boldness of his opponents in setting forth new Scriptures. He mentions only thirteen epistles of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> apostle, not counting that to the Hebrews  with the others. And unto our day there are some among the Romans who do not consider this a work of the apostle.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. The Bishops that were well known at that Time.</h2>

<p>1. After Antoninus  had reigned seven years and six months, Macrinus succeeded him. He held the government but a year, and was succeeded by another Antoninus. During his first year the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a>,  having held his office for eighteen years, died, and Callistus  received the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>.</p>

<p>2. He continued for five years, and was succeeded by Urbanus.  After this, Alexander became Roman emperor, Antoninus having reigned but four years.  At this time Philetus  also succeeded Asclepiades  in the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">church of Antioch</a>.</p>

<p>3. The mother of the emperor, Mamm&aelig;a  by name, was a most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, if there ever was one, and of religious life. When the fame of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> had extended everywhere and had come even to her ears, she desired greatly to see the man, and above all things to make trial of his celebrated understanding of divine things.</p>

<p>4. Staying for a time in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, she sent for him with a military escort. Having remained with her a while and shown her many things which were for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord and of the excellence of the divine teaching, he hastened back to his accustomed work.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22. The Works of Hippolytus which have reached us.</h2>

<p>1. At that time Hippolytus,  besides many other treatises, wrote a work on the passover.   He gives in this a chronological table, and presents a certain paschal canon of sixteen years, bringing the time down to the first year of the Emperor Alexander.</p>

<p>2. Of his other writings the following have reached us: On the Hex&aelig;meron,  On the Works after the Hex&aelig;meron,  Against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>,  On the Song of Songs,  On Portions of Ezekiel,  On the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>,  Against All the Heresies;  and you can find many other works preserved by many.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Origen's Zeal and his Elevation to the Presbyterate.</h2>

<p>1. At that time <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> began his commentaries on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>, being urged thereto by Ambrose,  who employed innumerable incentives, not only exhorting him by word, but also furnishing abundant means.</p>

<p>2. For he dictated to more than seven amanuenses, who relieved each other at appointed times. And he employed no fewer copyists, besides girls who were skilled in elegant writing. For all these Ambrose furnished the necessary expense in abundance, manifesting himself an inexpressible earnestness in diligence and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the divine oracles, by which he especially pressed him on to the preparation of his commentaries.</p>

<p>3. While these things were in progress, Urbanus,  who had been for eight years <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Roman church, was succeeded by Pontianus,  and Zebinus  succeeded Philetus  in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</p>

<p>4. At this time <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was sent to Greece on account of a pressing necessity in connection with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs,  and went through Palestine, and was ordained as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> in C&aelig;sarea by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of that country. The matters that were agitated concerning him on this account, and the decisions on these matters by those who presided over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, besides the other works concerning the divine word which he published while in his prime, demand a separate treatise. We have written of them to some extent in the second book of the Defense which we have composed in his behalf. </p>

<h2>Chapter 24. The Commentaries which he prepared at Alexandria.</h2>

<p>1. It may be well to add that in the sixth book of his exposition of the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Gospel of John</a>  he states that he prepared the first five while in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>. Of his work on the entire <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> only twenty-two volumes have come down to us.</p>

<p>2. In the ninth of those on Genesis,  of which there are twelve in all, he states that not only the preceding eight had been composed at Alexandria, but also those on the first twenty-five Psalms  and on Lamentations.  Of these last five volumes have reached us.</p>

<p>3. In them he mentions also his books On the Resurrection,  of which there are two. He wrote also the books De Principiis  before leaving Alexandria; and the discourses entitled Stromata,  ten in number, he composed in the same city during the reign of Alexander, as the notes by his own hand preceding the volumes indicate.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. His Review of the Canonical Scriptures.</h2>

<p>1. When expounding the first Psalm,  he gives a catalogue of the sacred Scriptures of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>  as follows:</p>

<p><q>It should be stated that the canonical books, as the Hebrews have handed them down, are twenty-two; corresponding with the number of their letters.</q> Farther on he says:</p>

<p>2. <q>The twenty-two books of the Hebrews are the following: That which is called by us Genesis, but by the Hebrews, from the beginning of the book, Bresith,  which means, 'In the beginning'; Exodus, Welesmoth,  that is, 'These are the names'; Leviticus, Wikra, 'And he called'; Numbers, Ammesphekodeim; Deuteronomy, Eleaddebareim, 'These are the words'; Jesus, the son of Nave, Josoue ben Noun; Judges and Ruth, among them in one book, Saphateim; the First and Second of Kings, among them one, Samouel, that is, 'The called of God'; the Third and Fourth of Kings in one, Wammelch David, that is, 'The kingdom of David'; of the Chronicles, the First and Second in one, Dabre&iuml;amein, that is, 'Records of days'; Esdras,  First and Second in one, Ezra, that is, 'An assistant'; the book of Psalms, Spharthelleim; the Proverbs of Solomon, Meloth; Ecclesiastes, Koelth; the Song of Songs (not, as some suppose, Songs of Songs), Sir Hassirim; Isaiah, Jessia; Jeremiah, with Lamentations and the epistle in one, Jeremia; Daniel, Daniel; Ezekiel, Jezekiel; Job, Job; Esther, Esther. And besides these there are the Maccabees, which are entitled Sarbeth Sabanaiel.</q>  He gives these in the above-mentioned work.</p>

<p>3. In his first book on Matthew's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,  maintaining the Canon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he testifies that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only four <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, writing as follows:</p>

<p>4. Among the four <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>,  which are the only indisputable ones in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> under heaven, I have learned by tradition that the first was written by Matthew, who was once a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, but afterwards an apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and it was prepared for the converts from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, and published in the Hebrew language. </p>

<p>5. The second is by Mark, who composed it according to the instructions of Peter,  who in his <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic epistle</a> acknowledges him as a son, saying, 'The church that is at <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> elected together with you, salutes you, and so does Marcus, my son.' <span class="stiki" id="note251980"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:13</a></span> </p>

<p>6. And the third by Luke, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> commended by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,  and composed for Gentile converts. Last of all that by John. </p>

<p>7. In the fifth book of his Expositions of John's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, he speaks thus concerning the epistles of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>:  But he who was 'made sufficient to be a minister of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, not of the letter, but of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,' <span class="stiki" id="note251984"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:6</a></span> that is, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who 'fully preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> from Jerusalem and round about even unto <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>,' <span class="stiki" id="note251985"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;15:19</a></span> did not write to all the churches which he had instructed and to those to which he wrote he sent but few lines. </p>

<p>8. And Peter, on whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is built, 'against which the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail,' <span class="stiki" id="note251987"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> has left one acknowledged epistle; perhaps also a second, but this is doubtful. </p>

<p>9. Why need we speak of him who reclined upon the bosom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>,  John, who has left us one <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,  though he confessed that he might write so many that the world could not contain them?  And he wrote also the Apocalypse, but was commanded to keep silence and not to write the words of the seven thunders. </p>

<p>10. He has left also an epistle of very few lines; perhaps also a second and third; but not all consider them genuine, and together they do not contain hundred lines.</p>

<p>11. In addition he makes the following statements in regard to the Epistle to the Hebrews  in his Homilies upon it: That the verbal style of the epistle entitled 'To the Hebrews,' is not rude like the language of the apostle, who acknowledged himself 'rude in speech' <span class="stiki" id="note251994"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:6</a></span> that is, in expression; but that its diction is purer Greek, any one who has the power to discern differences of phraseology will acknowledge.</p>

<p>12. Moreover, that the thoughts of the epistle are admirable, and not inferior to the acknowledged apostolic writings, any one who carefully examines the apostolic text  will admit.'</p>

<p>13. Farther on he adds: If I gave my opinion, I should say that the thoughts are those of the apostle, but the diction and phraseology are those of some one who remembered the apostolic teachings, and wrote down at his leisure what had been said by his teacher. Therefore if any church holds that this epistle is by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, let it be commended for this. For not without reason have the ancients handed it down as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a>.</p>

<p>14. But who wrote the epistle, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. The statement of some who have gone before us is that Clement, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Romans, wrote the epistle, and of others that Luke, the author of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the Acts, wrote it. But let this suffice on these matters.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Heraclas becomes Bishop of Alexandria.</h2>

<p>It was in the tenth year of the above-mentioned reign that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> removed from <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> to C&aelig;sarea,  leaving the charge of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> school in that city to Heraclas. Not long afterward Demetrius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">church of Alexandria</a>, died, having held the office for forty-three full years,  and Heraclas succeeded him. At this time Firmilianus,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia, was conspicuous.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. How the Bishops regarded Origen.</h2>

<p>He was so earnestly affected toward <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, that he urged him to come to that country for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and moreover he visited him in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, remaining with him for some time, for the sake of improvement in divine things. And Alexander,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem, and Theoctistus,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea, attended on him constantly,  as their only teacher, and allowed  him to expound the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>, and to perform the other duties pertaining to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discourse. </p>

<h2>Chapter 28. The Persecution under Maximinus.</h2>

<p>The Roman emperor, Alexander, having finished his reign in thirteen years, was succeeded by Maximinus C&aelig;sar.  On account of his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> toward the household of Alexander,  which contained many <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, he began a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, commanding that only the rulers of the churches should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, as responsible for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> teaching. Thereupon <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> composed his work On Martyrdom,  and dedicated it to Ambrose and Protoctetus,  a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the parish of C&aelig;sarea, because in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> there had come upon them both unusual hardships, in which it is reported that they were eminent in confession during the reign of Maximinus, which lasted but three years. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> has noted this as the time of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in the twenty-second book of his Commentaries on John, and in several epistles. </p>

<h2>Chapter 29. Fabianus, who was wonderfully designated Bishop of Rome by God.</h2>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Gordianus</span> succeeded Maximinus as Roman emperor;  and Pontianus,  who had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for six years, was succeeded by Anteros.  After he had held the office for a month, Fabianus  succeeded him.</p>

<p>2. They say  that Fabianus having come, after the death of Anteros, with others from the country, was staying at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that while there he was chosen to the office through a most wonderful manifestation of divine and heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>3. For when all the brethren had assembled to select by vote him who should succeed to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of the church, several renowned and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> men were in the minds of many, but Fabianus, although present, was in the mind of none. But they relate that suddenly a dove flying down lighted on his head, resembling the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> on the Saviour in the form of a dove.</p>

<p>4. Thereupon all the people, as if moved by one Divine Spirit, with all eagerness and unanimity cried out that he was worthy, and without delay they took him and placed him upon the episcopal seat. </p>

<p>5. About that time Zebinus,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> died, and Babylas  succeeded him. And in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> Heraclas,  having received the episcopal office after Demetrius,  was succeeded in the charge of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> school by Dionysius,  who had also been one of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> pupils.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30. The Pupils of Origen.</h2>

<p>While <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was carrying on his customary duties in C&aelig;sarea, many pupils came to him not only from the vicinity, but also from other countries. Among these Theodorus, the same that was distinguished among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of our day under the name of Gregory,  and his brother Athenodorus,  we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have been especially celebrated. Finding them deeply interested in Greek and Roman learning, he infused into them a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and led them to exchange their old <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the study of divinity. Remaining with him five years, they made such progress in divine things, that although they were still young, both of them were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> in the churches of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31. Africanus.</h2>

<p>1. At this time also <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Africanus</a>,  the writer of the books entitled Cesti, was well known. There is extant an epistle of his to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, expressing doubts  of the story of Susannah in Daniel, as being spurious and fictitious. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> answered this very fully.</p>

<p>2. Other works of the same <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Africanus</a> which have reached us are his five books on Chronology, a work accurately and laboriously prepared. He says in this that he went to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> on account of the great fame of Heraclas,  who excelled especially in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> studies and other Greek learning, and whose appointment to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> of the church there we have already mentioned.</p>

<p>3. There is extant also another epistle from the same <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Africanus</a> to <a href="../cathen/01712d.htm">Aristides</a> on the supposed discrepancy between Matthew and Luke in the Genealogies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In this he shows clearly the agreement of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, from an account which had come down to him, which we have already given in its proper place in the first book of this work. </p>

<h2>Chapter 32. The Commentaries which Origencomposed in C&aelig;sarea in Palestine.</h2>

<p>1. About this time <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> prepared his Commentaries on Isaiah  and on Ezekiel.  Of the former there have come down to us thirty books, as far as the third part of Isaiah, to the vision of the beasts in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>;  on Ezekiel twenty-five books, which are all that he wrote on the whole <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</p>

<p>2. Being at that time in Athens,  he finished his work on Ezekiel and commenced his Commentaries on the Song of Songs,  which he carried forward to the fifth book. After his return to C&aelig;sarea, he completed these also, ten books in number.</p>

<p>3. But why should we give in this history an accurate catalogue of the man's works, which would require a separate treatise?  we have furnished this also in our narrative of the life of Pamphilus,  a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of our own time. After showing how great the diligence of Pamphilus was in divine things, we give in that a catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> which he collected of the works of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and of other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers. Whoever desires may learn readily from this which of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> works have reached us. But we must proceed now with our history.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33. The Error of Beryllus.</h2>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Beryllus, </span> whom we mentioned recently as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Bostra in Arabia, turned aside from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> standard  and attempted to introduce ideas foreign to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He dared to assert that our Saviour and Lord did not pre-exist in a distinct form of being of his own  before his abode among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and that he does not possess a divinity of his own,  but only that of the Father dwelling in him.</p>

<p>2. Many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> carried on investigations and discussions with him on this matter, and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> having been invited with the others, went down at first for a conference with him to ascertain his real opinion. But when he understood his views, and perceived that they were erroneous, having persuaded him by argument, and convinced him by demonstration, he brought him back to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine, and restored  him to his former sound opinion.</p>

<p>3. There are still extant writings of Beryllus and of the synod held on his account, which contain the questions put to him by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and the discussions which were carried on in his parish, as well as all the things done at that time.</p>

<p>4. The elder brethren among us  have handed down many other facts respecting <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> which I think proper to omit, as not pertaining to this work. But whatever it has seemed necessary to record about him can be found in the Apology in his behalf written by us and Pamphilus, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of our day. We prepared this carefully and did the work jointly on account of faultfinders. </p>

<h2>Chapter 34. Philip C&aelig;sar.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Gordianus</span> had been Roman emperor for six years when Philip, with his son Philip, succeeded him.  It is reported that he, being a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, desired, on the day of the last paschal vigil, to share with the multitude in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,  but that he was not permitted to enter, by him who then presided,  until he had made confession and had numbered himself among those who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of penance.  For if he had not done this, he would never have been received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35. Dionysius succeeds Heraclas in the Episcopate.</h2>

<p>In the third year of this emperor, Heraclas  died, having held his office for sixteen years, and Dionysius  received the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of the churches of Alexandria.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36. Other Works of Origen.</h2>

<p>1. At this time, as the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> extended and our doctrine was proclaimed boldly before all,  <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, being, as they say, over sixty years old,  and having gained great facility by his long practice, very properly permitted his public discourses to be taken down by stenographers, a thing which he had never before allowed.</p>

<p>2. He also at this time composed a work of eight books in answer to that entitled True Discourse, which had been written against us by Celsus  the Epicurean, and the twenty-five books on the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Matthew,  besides those on the Twelve Prophets, of which we have found only twenty-five. </p>

<p>3. There is extant also an epistle  of his to the Emperor Philip, and another to Severa his wife, with several others to different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. We have arranged in distinct books to the number of one hundred, so that they might be no longer scattered, as many of these as we have been able to collect,  which have been preserved here and there by different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.</p>

<p>4. He wrote also to Fabianus,  <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, and to many other rulers of the churches concerning his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. You have examples of these in the eighth book of the Apology  which we have written in his behalf.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37. The Dissension of the Arabians.</h2> 

<p>About the same time others arose in Arabia, putting forward a doctrine foreign to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. They said that during the present time the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dies and perishes with the body, but that at the time of the resurrection they will be renewed together. And at that time also a synod of considerable size assembled, and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, being again invited there, spoke publicly on the question with such effect that the opinions of those who had formerly fallen were changed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38. The Heresy of the Elkesites.</h2>

<p>Another <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> also arose at this time, called the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Elkesites,  which was extinguished in the very beginning. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> speaks of it in this manner in a public homily on the eighty-second Psalm: </p>

<p><q>A certain man  came just now, puffed up greatly with his own ability, proclaiming that godless and impious opinion which has appeared lately in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, styled 'of the Elkesites.' I will show you what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things that opinion teaches, that you may not be carried away by it. It rejects certain parts of every scripture. Again it uses portions of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, but rejects the apostle  altogether. It says that to deny Christ is an indifferent matter, and that he who understands will, under necessity, deny with his mouth, but not in his heart. They produce a certain book which they say fell from heaven. They hold that whoever hears and believes  this shall receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, another remission than that which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has given.</q> Such is the account of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39. The Persecution under Decius, and the Sufferings of Origen.</h2>

<p>1. After a reign of seven years Philip was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>.  On account of his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of Philip, he commenced a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, in which Fabianus  suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Cornelius succeeded him in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. </p>

<p>2. In Palestine, Alexander,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church of Jerusalem, was brought again on Christ's account before the governor's judgment seat in C&aelig;sarea, and having acquitted himself nobly in a second confession was cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, crowned with the hoary locks of venerable age.</p>

<p>3. And after his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> and illustrious confession at the tribunal of the governor, he fell asleep in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and Mazabanes  became his successor in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>4. Babylas  in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, having like Alexander passed away in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> after his confession, was succeeded by Fabius  in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of that church.</p>

<p>5. But how many and how great things came upon <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and what was their final result&mdash;as the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> marshaled all his forces, and fought against the man with his utmost craft and power, assaulting him beyond all others against whom he contended at that time,&mdash; and what and how many things he endured for the word of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, bonds and bodily tortures and torments under the iron collar and in the dungeon; and how for many days with his feet stretched four spaces in the stocks  he bore patiently the threats of fire and whatever other things were inflicted by his enemies; and how his sufferings terminated, as his judge strove eagerly with all his might not to end his life; and what words he left after these things, full of comfort to those needing aid, a great many of his epistles show with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and accuracy. </p>

<h2>Chapter 40. The Events which happened to Dionysius.</h2> 

<p>1. I shall quote from the epistle of Dionysius to Germanus  an account of what befell the former. Speaking of himself, he writes as follows: I speak before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that I do not lie. I did not flee on my own impulse nor without divine direction.</p>

<p>2. But even before this, at the very hour when the Decian <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was commanded, Sabinus  sent a frumentarius  to search for me, and I remained at home four days awaiting his arrival.</p>

<p>3. But he went about examining all places&mdash;roads, rivers, and fields&mdash;where he thought I might be concealed or on the way. But he was smitten with blindness, and did not find the house,  for he did not suppose, that being pursued, I would remain at home. And after the fourth day God commanded me to depart, and made a way for me in a wonderful manner; and I and my attendants  and many of the brethren went away together. And that this occurred through the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God was made manifest by what followed, in which perhaps we were useful to some.</p>

<p>4. Farther on he relates in this manner what happened to him after his flight:</p>

<p><q>For about sunset, having been seized with those that were with me, I was taken by the soldiers to Taposiris,  but in the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Timothy  was not present and was not captured. But coming later, he found the house deserted and guarded by soldiers, and ourselves reduced to slavery.</q> </p>

<p>5. After a little he says:</p>

<p>And what was the manner of his admirable management? For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall be told. One of the country people met Timothy fleeing and disturbed, and inquired the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his haste. And he told him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>6. And when the man heard it (he was on his way to a marriage feast, for it was customary to spend the entire night in such gatherings), he entered and announced it to those at the table. And they, as if on a preconcerted signal, arose with one impulse, and rushed out quickly and came and burst in upon us with a shout. Immediately the soldiers who were guarding us fled, and they came to us lying as we were upon the bare couches.</p>

<p>7. But I, God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, thought at first that they were <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> who had come for spoil and plunder. So I remained upon the bed on which I was, clothed only in a linen garment, and offered them the rest of my clothing which was lying beside me. But they directed me to rise and come away quickly.</p>

<p>8. Then I understood why they had come, and I cried out, beseeching and entreating them to depart and leave us alone. And I requested them, if they desired to benefit me in any way, to anticipate those who were carrying me off, and cut off my head themselves. And when I had cried out in this manner, as my companions and partners in everything <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, they raised me by force. But I threw myself on my back on the ground; and they seized me by the hands and feet and dragged me away.</p>

<p>9. And the witnesses of all these occurrences followed: Gaius, Faustus, Peter, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.  But they who had seized me carried me out of the village hastily, and placing me on an ass without a saddle, bore me away. </p>

<p>Dionysius relates these things respecting himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 41. The Martyrs in Alexandria.</h2>

<p>1. The same writer, in an epistle to Fabius,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, relates as follows the sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>:</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> among us did not begin with the royal decree, but preceded it an entire year.  The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>  to this city, whoever he was, previously moved and aroused against us the masses of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, rekindling among them the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of their country.</p>

<p>2. And being thus excited by him and finding full opportunity for any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, they considered this the only <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> service of their <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, that they should slay us.</p>

<p>3. They seized first an old man named Metras,  and commanded him to utter impious words. But as he would not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, they beat him with clubs, and tore his face and eyes with sharp sticks, and dragged him out of the city and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> him.</p>

<p>4. Then they carried to their idol temple a faithful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, named Quinta, that they might force her to worship. And as she turned away in detestation, they bound her feet and dragged her through the entire city over the stone-paved streets, and dashed her against the millstones, and at the same time scourged her; then, taking her to the same place, they <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> her to death.</p>

<p>5. Then all with one impulse rushed to the homes of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and they dragged forth whomsoever any one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> as a neighbor, and despoiled and plundered them. They took for themselves the more valuable property; but the poorer articles and those made of wood they scattered about and burned in the streets, so that the city appeared as if taken by an enemy.</p>

<p>6. But the brethren withdrew and went away, and 'took joyfully the spoiling of their goods,'  like those to whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of no one unless possibly some one who fell into their hands, who, up to this time, denied the Lord.</p>

<p>7. Then they seized also that most admirable virgin, Apollonia, an old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and, smiting her on the jaws, broke out all her teeth. And they made a fire outside the city and threatened to burn her alive if she would not join with them in their impious cries. And she, supplicating a little, was released, when she leaped eagerly into the fire and was consumed.</p>

<p>8. Then they seized Serapion in his own house, and tortured him with harsh cruelties, and having broken all his limbs, they threw him headlong from an upper story. And there was no street, nor public road, nor lane open to us, by night or day; for always and everywhere, all of them cried out that if any one would not repeat their impious words, he should immediately be dragged away and burned.</p>

<p>9. And matters continued thus for a considerable time. But a sedition and civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> came upon the wretched people and turned their cruelty toward us against one another.  So we breathed for a little while as they ceased from their rage against us. But presently the change from that milder reign was announced to us,  and great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of what was threatened seized us.</p>

<p>10. For the decree arrived, almost like that most terrible time foretold by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, which if it were possible would offend even the elect. </p>

<p>11. All <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> were affrighted. And many of the more eminent in their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> came forward immediately;  others who were in the public service were drawn on by their official duties;  others were urged on by their acquaintances. And as their names were called they approached the impure and impious <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. Some of them were pale and trembled as if they were not about to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, but to be themselves <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and offerings to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; so that they were jeered at by the multitude who stood around, as it was plain to every one that they were afraid either to die or to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</p>

<p>12. But some advanced to the altars more readily, declaring boldly that they had never been <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Of these the prediction of our Lord is most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that they shall 'hardly'  be saved. Of the rest some followed the one, others the other of these classes, some fled and some were seized.</p>

<p>13. And of the latter some continued faithful until bonds and imprisonment, and some who had even been imprisoned for many days yet abjured the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> before they were brought to trial. Others having for a time endured great tortures finally retracted.</p>

<p>14. But the firm and blessed pillars of the Lord being strengthened by him, and having received vigor and might suitable and appropriate to the strong <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they possessed, became admirable witnesses of his kingdom.</p>

<p>15. The first of these was Julian, a man who suffered so much with the gout that he was unable to stand or walk. They brought him forward with two others who carried him. One of these immediately denied. But the other, whose name was Cronion, and whose surname was Eunus, and the old man Julian himself, both of them having confessed the Lord, were carried on camels through the entire city, which, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is a very large one, and in this elevated position were beaten and finally burned in a fierce fire,  surrounded by all the populace.</p>

<p>16. But a soldier, named Besas, who stood by them as they were led away rebuked those who insulted them. And they cried out against him, and this most manly warrior of God was arraigned, and having done nobly in the great contest for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, was beheaded.</p>

<p>17. A certain other one, a Libyan by birth, but in name and blessedness a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Macar,  was strongly urged by the judge to recant; but as he would not yield he was burned alive. After them Epimachus and Alexander, having remained in bonds for a long time, and endured countless agonies from scrapers  and scourges, were also consumed in a fierce fire. </p>

<p>18. And with them there were four <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Ammonarium, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> virgin, the judge tortured relentlessly and excessively, because she declared from the first that she would utter none of those things which he commanded; and having kept her promise <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, she was dragged away. The others were Mercuria, a very remarkable old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and Dionysia, the mother of many children, who did not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> her own children above the Lord.  As the governor was ashamed of torturing thus ineffectually, and being always defeated by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, they were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the sword, without the trial of tortures. For the champion, Ammonarium, endured these in behalf of all.</p>

<p>19. The Egyptians, Heron and Ater and Isidorus, and with them Dioscorus,  a boy about fifteen years old, were delivered up. At first the judge attempted to deceive the lad by fair words, as if he could be brought over easily, and then to force him by tortures, as one who would readily yield. But Dioscorus was neither persuaded nor constrained.</p>

<p>20. As the others remained firm, he scourged them cruelly and then delivered them to the fire. But admiring the manner in which Dioscorus had distinguished himself publicly, and his wise answers to his persuasions, he dismissed him, saying that on account of his youth he would give him time for repentance. And this most godly Dioscorus is among us now, awaiting a longer conflict and more severe contest.</p>

<p>21. But a certain Nemesion, who also was an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, was accused as an associate of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>; but when he had cleared himself before the centurion of this charge most foreign to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he was informed against as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and taken in bonds before the governor. And the most unrighteous magistrate inflicted on him tortures and scourgings double those which he executed on the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and then burned him between the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, thus honoring the blessed man by the likeness to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>22. A band of soldiers, Ammon and Zeno and Ptolemy and Ingenes, and with them an old man, Theophilus, were standing close together before the tribunal. And as a certain person who was being tried as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, seemed inclined to deny, they standing by gnashed their teeth, and made signs with their faces and stretched out their hands, and gestured with their bodies. And when the attention of all was turned to them, before any one else could seize them, they rushed up to the tribunal saying that they were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, so that the governor and his council were affrighted. And those who were on trial appeared most courageous in prospect of their sufferings, while their judges trembled. And they went exultingly from the tribunal rejoicing in their testimony;  God himself having caused them to triumph <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42. Others of whom Dionysius gives an Account.</h2>

<p>1. Many others, in cities and villages, were torn asunder by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, of whom I will mention one as an illustration. Ischyrion  was employed as a steward by one of the rulers. His employer commanded him to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and on his refusal insulted him, and as he remained firm, abused him. And as he still held out he seized a long staff and thrust it through his bowels  and slew him.</p>

<p>2. Why need I speak of the multitude that wandered in the deserts and mountains, and perished by hunger, and thirst, and cold, and sickness, and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and wild beasts? Those of them who survived are witnesses of their election and victory.</p>

<p>3. But I will relate one occurrence as an example. Ch&aelig;remon,  who was very old, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city called Nilus. He fled with his wife  to the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> mountain  and did not return. And though the brethren searched diligently they could not find either them or their bodies.</p>

<p>4. And many who fled to the same <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> mountain were carried into slavery by the barbarian Saracens. Some of them were ransomed with difficulty and at a large price; others have not been to the present time. I have related these things, my brother, not without an object, but that you may understand how many and great distresses came upon us. Those indeed will understand them the best who have had the largest experience of them.</p>

<p>5. A little further on he adds: These divine <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> among us, who now are seated with Christ, and are sharers in his kingdom, partakers of his judgment and judges with him, received some of the brethren who had fallen away and become chargeable with the guilt of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a>. When they perceived that their conversion and repentance were sufficient to be acceptable with him who by no means desires the death of the sinner, but his repentance, having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> them they received them back and brought them together, and met with them and had fellowship with them in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and feasts. </p>

<p>6. What counsel then, brethren, do you give us concerning such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>? What should we do? Shall we have the same judgment and rule as theirs, and observe their decision and charity, and show mercy to those whom they pitied? Or, shall we declare their decision unrighteous, and set ourselves as judges of their opinion, and grieve mercy and overturn order?  These words Dionysius very properly added when making mention of those who had been weak in the time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 43. Novatus,  his Manner of Life and his Heresy.</h2>

<p>1. After this, Novatus, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, being lifted up with arrogance against these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as if there was no longer for them a hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, not even if they should do all things pertaining to a genuine and pure conversion, became leader of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of those who, in the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of their imagination, call themselves Cathari. </p>

<p>2. There upon a very large synod assembled at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>,  of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in number sixty, and a great many more <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>; while the pastors of the remaining provinces deliberated in their places privately concerning what ought to be done. A decree was confirmed by all, that Novatus and those who joined with him, and those who adopted his brother-hating and inhuman opinion, should be considered by the church as strangers; but that they should heal such of the brethren as had fallen into misfortune,  and should minister to them with the medicines of repentance.</p>

<p>3. There have reached us epistles  of Cornelius, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, to Fabius, of the church at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, which show what was done at the synod at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and what seemed best to all those in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and Africa and the regions thereabout.  Also other epistles, written in the Latin language, of Cyprian and those with him in Africa,  which show that they agreed as to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of succoring those who had been tempted, and of cutting off from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the leader of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and all that joined with him.</p>

<p>4. Another epistle of Cornelius, concerning the resolutions of the synod, is attached to these; and yet others,  on the conduct of Novatus, from which it is proper for us to make selections, that any one who sees this work may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about him.</p>

<p>5. Cornelius informs Fabius what sort of a man Novatus was, in the following words:</p>

<p>But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that a long time ago this remarkable man desired the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, but kept this ambitious desire to himself and concealed it&mdash;using as a cloak for his rebellion those confessors who had adhered to him from the beginning&mdash;I desire to speak.</p>

<p>6. Maximus,  one of our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and Urbanus,  who twice gained the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> by confession, with Sidonius,  and Celerinus,  a man who by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God most heroically endured all kinds of torture, and by the strength of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> overcame the weakness of the flesh, and mightily conquered the adversary&mdash;these men found him out and detected his craft and duplicity, his <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjuries</a> and falsehoods, his unsociability and cruel friendship. And they returned to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> church and proclaimed in the presence of many, both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and a large number of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, all his craft and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, which for a long time he had concealed. And this they did with lamentations and repentance, because through the persuasions of the crafty and malicious beast they had left the church for the time. A little farther on he says:</p>

<p>7. How remarkable, beloved brother, the change and transformation which we have seen take place in him in a short time. For this most illustrious man, who bound himself with terrible oaths in nowise to seek the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>,  suddenly  appears a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as if thrown among us by some machine. </p>

<p>8. For this dogmatist, this defender of the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,  attempting to grasp and seize the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, which had not been given him from above, chose two of his companions who had given up their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And he sent them to a small and insignificant corner of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, that there by some counterfeit argument he might deceive three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who were rustic and very simple men. And they asserted positively and strongly that it was necessary that they should come quickly to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in order that all the dissension which had arisen there might be appeased through their mediation, jointly with other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</p>

<p>9. When they had come, being, as we have stated, very simple in the craft and artifice of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, they were shut up with certain selected men like himself. And by the tenth hour, when they had become drunk and sick, he compelled them by force to confer on him the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> through a counterfeit and vain imposition of hands. Because it had not come to him, he avenged himself by craft and treachery.</p>

<p>10. One of these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> shortly after came back to the church, lamenting and confessing his transgression. And we communed with him as with a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, all the people present interceding for him. And we ordained successors of the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and sent them to the places where they were.</p>

<p>11. This avenger of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>  then did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there should be one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in a catholic church;  yet he was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> (for how could he be?) that in it there were forty-six <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, seven  <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, seven <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacons</a>,  forty-two acolyths,  fifty-two exorcists,  readers,  and janitors,  and over fifteen hundred <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in distress, all of whom the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and kindness of the Master nourish.</p>

<p>12. But not even this great multitude, so necessary in the church, nor those who, through God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, were rich and full, together with the very many, even innumerable people, could turn him from such desperation and presumption and recall him to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>13. Again, farther on, he adds these words: Permit us to say further: On account of what works or conduct had he the assurance to contend for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>? Was it that he had been brought up in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the beginning, and had endured many conflicts in her behalf, and had passed through many and great dangers for religion? Truly this is not the fact.</p>

<p>14. But <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, who entered and dwelt in him for a long time, became the occasion of his believing. Being delivered by the exorcists, he fell into a severe sickness; and as he seemed about to die, he received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by affusion, on the bed where he lay;  if indeed we can say that such a one did receive it.</p>

<p>15. And when he was healed of his sickness he did not receive the other things which it is necessary to have according to the canon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even the being sealed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.  And as he did not receive this,  how could he receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>?</p>

<p>16. Shortly after he says again:</p>

<p><q>In the time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, through cowardice and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of life, he denied that he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. For when he was requested and entreated by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to come out of the chamber in which he had imprisoned himself and give aid to the brethren as far as was lawful and possible for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> to assist those of the brethren who were in danger and needed help, he paid so little respect to the entreaties of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> that he went away and departed in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For he said that he no longer desired to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, as he was an admirer of another <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.</q> </p>

<p>17. Passing by a few things, he adds the following:</p>

<p><q>For this illustrious man forsook the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, in which, when he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, he was judged worthy of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbyterate</a> through the favor of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who ordained him to the presbyterial office. This had been resisted by all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and many of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>; because it was unlawful that one who had been affused on his bed on account of sickness as he had been should enter into any clerical office;  but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> requested that he might be permitted to ordain this one only.</q></p>

<p>18. He adds to these yet another, the worst of all the man's offenses, as follows:</p>

<p>For when he has made the offerings, and distributed a part to each man, as he gives it he compels the wretched man to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> in place of the blessing. Holding his hands in both of his own, he will not release him until he has <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> in this manner (for I will give his own words):</p>

<p>'Swear to me by the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> that you will never forsake me and turn to Cornelius.'</p>

<p>19. And the unhappy man does not taste until he has called down imprecations on himself; and instead of saying <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, as he takes the bread, he says, I will never return to Cornelius. Farther on he says again:</p>

<p>20. <q>But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he has now been made bare and desolate; as the brethren leave him every day and return to the church. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>  also, the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, who lately suffered among us a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and admirable <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, while he was yet alive, beholding his boldness and folly, refused to commune with him and with the five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who with him had separated themselves from the church.</q></p>

<p>21. At the close of his letter he gives a list of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and condemned the silliness of Novatus, with their names and the parish over which each of them presided.</p>

<p>22. He mentions also those who did not come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but who expressed by letters their agreement with the vote of these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, giving their names and the cities from which they severally sent them.  Cornelius wrote these things to Fabius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44. Dionysius' Account of Serapion.</h2>

<p>1. To this same Fabius, who seemed to lean somewhat toward this <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>,  Dionysius of Alexandria also wrote an epistle.  He writes in this many other things concerning repentance, and relates the conflicts of those who had lately suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at Alexandria. After the other account he mentions a certain wonderful fact, which deserves a place in this work. It is as follows:</p>

<p>2. I will give you this one example which occurred among us. There was with us a certain Serapion,  an aged believer who had lived for a long time blamelessly, but had fallen in the trial. He besought often, but no one gave heed to him, because he had <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>. But he became sick, and for three successive days continued speechless and senseless.</p>

<p>3. Having recovered somewhat on the fourth day he sent for his daughter's son, and said, How long do you detain me, my child? I beseech you, make haste, and absolve me speedily. Call one of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> to me. And when he had said this, he became again speechless. And the boy ran to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. But it was night and he was sick, and therefore unable to come.</p>

<p>4. But as I had commanded that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> at the point of death, if they requested it, and especially if they had asked for it previously, should receive remission, that they might depart with a good hope, he gave the boy a small portion of the eucharist, telling him to soak  it and let the drops fall into the old man's mouth. </p>

<p>5. The boy returned with it, and as he drew near, before he entered, Serapion again arousing, said, 'You have come, my child, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> could not come; but do quickly what he directed, and let me depart.' Then the boy soaked it and dropped it into his mouth. And when he had swallowed a little, immediately he gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>6. Is it not evident that he was preserved and his life continued till he was absolved, and, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> having been blotted out, he could be acknowledged  for the many good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which he had done?</p>

<p>Dionysius relates these things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 45. An Epistle of Dionysius to Novatus.</h2>

<p>1. But let us see how the same man addressed Novatus  when he was disturbing the Roman brotherhood. As he pretended that some of the brethren were the occasion of his <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, as if he had been forced by them to proceed as he had,  observe the manner in which he writes to him:</p>

<p>2. <q>Dionysius to his brother Novatus, greeting. If, as you say, you have been led on unwillingly, you will prove this if you retire willingly. For it were better to suffer everything, rather than divide the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. Even <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for the sake of preventing division would not be less <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than for refusing to worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. Nay, to me it seems greater. For in the one case a man suffers <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for the sake of his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; in the other case in behalf of the entire Church. And now if you can persuade or induce the brethren to come to unanimity, your righteousness will be greater than your <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and this will not be counted, but that will be praised. But if you can not prevail with the disobedient, at least save your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you may fare well, maintaining peace in the Lord.</q> This he wrote to Novatus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 46. Other Epistles of Dionysius.</h2>

<p>1. He wrote also an epistle to the brethren in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> on Repentance.  In this he sets forth what seemed proper to him in regard to those who had fallen, and he describes the classes of transgressions.</p>

<p>2. There is extant also a private letter on Repentance, which he wrote to Conon,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the parish of Hermopolis, and another of an admonitory  character, to his flock at Alexandria. Among them also is the one written to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> on Martyrdom  and to the brethren at <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>,  of whom Thelymidres was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He likewise sent one on Repentance to the brethren in Armenia,  of whom Merozanes was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<p>3. Besides all these, he wrote to Cornelius of Rome, when he had received from him an epistle against Novatus.  He states in this that he had been invited by Helenus,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Tarsus, in Cilicia, and the others who were with him, Firmilianus,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in Cappadocia, and Theoctistus,  of Palestine, to meet them at the synod in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, where some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were endeavoring to establish the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Novatus.</p>

<p>4. Besides this he writes that he had been informed that Fabius  had fallen asleep, and that Demetrianus  had been appointed his successor in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. He writes also in these words concerning the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem: <q>For the blessed Alexander  having been confined in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, passed away happily.</q></p>

<p>5. In addition to this there is extant also a certain other diaconal epistle of Dionysius, sent to those in Rome through Hippolytus.  And he wrote another to them on Peace, and likewise on Repentance;  and yet another to the confessors there who still held to the opinion of Novatus.  He sent two more to the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> after they had returned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And he communicated with many others by letters, which he has left behind him as a benefit in various ways to those who now diligently study his writings. </p>
