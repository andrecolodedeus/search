<h1>Church History (Book V)</h1>

<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<p>Before we begin the fifth book of our history, we must beg those who may peruse this treatise, not to censure us too hastily because having set out to write a church history we still intermingle with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, such an account of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> which took place during the period under consideration, as could be duly authenticated. For this we have done for several reasons: first, in order to lay before our readers an exact statement of facts; but secondly, in order that the minds of the readers might not become satiated with the repetition of the contentious disputes of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and their insidious designs against one another; but more especially that it might be made apparent, that whenever the affairs of the state were disturbed, those of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as if by some vital sympathy, became disordered also.  Indeed whoever shall attentively examine the subject will find, that the mischiefs of the state, and the troubles of the church have been inseparably connected; for he will perceive that they have either arisen together, or immediately succeeded one another. Sometimes the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> come first in order; then commotions in the state follow, and sometimes the reverse, so that I cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this invariable interchange is merely fortuitous, but am persuaded that it proceeds from our iniquities; and that these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are inflicted upon us as merited chastisements, if indeed as the apostle <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> says, 'Some men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.' <span class="stiki" id="note260678"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:24</a></span> For this reason we have interwoven many affairs of the state with our <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. Of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> carried on during the reign of Constantine we have made no mention, having found no account of them that could be depended upon because of their iniquity: but of subsequent events, as much information as we could gather from those still living  in the order of their occurrence, we have passed in rapid review. We have continually included the emperors in these historical details; because from the time they began to profess the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have depended on them, so that even the greatest Synods have been, and still are convened by their appointment. Finally, we have particularly noticed the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, because it has so greatly disquieted the churches. Let these remarks be considered sufficient in the way of preface: we shall now proceed with our history.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 1. After the Death of Valens the Goths again attack Constantinople, and are repulsed by the Citizens, aided by Some Saracen Auxiliaries.</h2>

<p>After the Emperor Valens had thus lost his life, in a manner which has never been satisfactorily ascertained,  the barbarians again approached the very walls of Constantinople, and laid waste the suburbs on every side of it. Whereat the people becoming indignant armed themselves with whatever weapons they could severally lay hands on, and sallied forth of their own accord against the enemy. The empress Dominica caused the same pay to be distributed out of the imperial treasury to such as volunteered to go out on this service, as was usually allowed to soldiers. A few Saracens also assisted the citizens, being confederates, who had been sent by Mavia their queen: the latter we have already mentioned.  In this way the people having fought at this time, the barbarians retired to a great distance from the city.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The Emperor Gratian recalls the Orthodox Bishops, and expels the Heretics from the Churches. He takes Theodosius as his Colleague in the Empire.</h2>

<p>Gratian being now in possession of the empire, together with Valentinian the younger, and condemning the cruel policy of his uncle Valens towards the [<a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>] <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, recalled those whom he had sent into exile. He moreover enacted that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, without distinction, might securely assemble together in their churches; and that only the Eunomians,  <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a>,  and <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>  should be excluded from the churches. Being also sensible of the languishing condition of the Roman empire, and of the growing power of the barbarians and perceiving that the state was in need of a brave and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man, he took Theodosius as his colleague in the sovereign power. This [Theodosius] was descended from a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and had acquired so distinguished a celebrity for his prowess in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, that he was universally considered worthy of imperial dignity, even before Gratian's election of him. Having therefore proclaimed him emperor at Sirmium a city of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a> in the consulate  of Ausonius and Olybrius, on the 16th of January, he divided with him the care of managing the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the barbarians.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 3. The Principal Bishops who flourished at that Time.</h2>

<p>Now at this time Damasus who had succeeded Liberius then presided over the church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Cyril was still in possession of that at Jerusalem. The <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antiochian</a> church, as we have stated, was divided into three parts: for the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> had chosen Dorotheus as the successor of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Euzo&iuml;us; while one portion of the rest was under the government of Paulinus, and the others ranged themselves with Melitius, who had been recalled from exile. Lucius, although absent, having been compelled to leave Alexandria, yet maintained the episcopal authority among the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> of that city; the Homoousians there being headed by Timothy, who succeeded Peter. At Constantinople Demophilus the successor of Eudoxius presided over the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> faction, and was in possession of the churches; but those who were averse to communion with him held their assemblies apart.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Macedonians, who had subscribed the 'Homoousian' Doctrine, return to their Former Error.</h2>

<p>After the deputation from the Macedonians to Liberius, that <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was admitted to entire communion with the churches in every city, intermixing themselves indiscriminately with those who from the beginning had embraced the form of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> published at Nic&aelig;a. But when the law of the <a href="../cathen/06729c.htm">Emperor Gratian</a> permitted the several <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> to reunite without restraint in the public services of religion, they again resolved to separate themselves; and having met at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, they decided to avoid the word <em>homoousios</em> again, and in no way to hold communion with the supporters of the Nicene Creed. They however derived no advantage from this attempt; for the majority of their own party being disgusted at the fickleness with which they sometimes maintained one opinion, and then another, withdrew from them, and thenceforward became firm adherents of those who professed the doctrine of the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a>.</em>  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; Events at Antioch in Connection with Paulinus and Meletius.</h2>

<p>About this time a serious contest was excited at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, on account of Melitius. We have already observed  that Paulinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, because of his eminent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was not sent into exile: and that Melitius after being restored by Julian, was again banished by Valens, and at length recalled in Gratian's reign.  On his return to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, he found Paulinus greatly enfeebled by old age; his partisans therefore immediately used their utmost endeavors to get him associated with that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the episcopal office. And when Paulinus declared that 'it was contrary to the canons  to take as a coadjutor one who had been ordained by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>,' the people had recourse to <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and caused him to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in one of the churches without the city. When this was done, a great disturbance arose; but afterwards the people were brought to unite on the following stipulations. Having assembled such of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as might be considered worthy candidates for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>, they found them six in number, of whom Flavian was one. All these they bound by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, not to use any effort to get themselves ordained, when either of the two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should die, but to permit the survivor to retain undisturbed possession of the see of the deceased.  Thus pledges were given, and the people had peace and so no longer quarreled with one another. The Luciferians,  however, separated themselves from the rest, because Melitius who had been ordained by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> was admitted to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. In this state of the <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antiochian</a> church, Melitius was under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of going to Constantinople.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Gregory of Nazianzus is transferred to the See of Constantinople. The Emperor Theodosius falling Sick at Thessalonica, after his Victory over the Barbarians, is there baptizedby Ascholius the Bishop.</h2>

<p>By the common suffrage of many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Gregory was at this time translated from the see of Nazianzus to that of Constantinople,  and this happened in the manner before described. About the same time the emperors Gratian and Theodosius each obtained a victory over the barbarians.  And Gratian immediately set out for <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, because the Alemanni were ravaging those provinces: but Theodosius, after erecting a trophy, hastened towards Constantinople, and arrived at Thessalonica. There he was taken dangerously ill, and expressed a desire to receive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.  Now he had been instructed in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> principles by his ancestors, and professed the 'homoousian' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Becoming increasingly anxious to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> therefore, as his malady grew worse, he sent for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Thessalonica, and first asked him what doctrinal views he held? The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> having replied, 'that the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> had not yet invaded the provinces of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>, nor had the novelty to which that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> had given birth begun to prey upon the churches in those countries; but they continued to preserve unshaken that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which from the beginning was delivered by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and had been confirmed in the Nicene Synod,' the emperor was most gladly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Ascholius; and having recovered from his disease not many days after, he came to Constantinople on the twenty-fourth of November, in the fifth consulate of Gratian, and the first of his own.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Gregory, finding Some Dissatisfaction about his Appointment, abdicates the Episcopate of Constantinople. The Emperor orders Demophilus the ArianBishop either to assent to the 'Homoousion,' or leave the City. He chooses the Latter.</h2>

<p>Now at that time Gregory of Nazianzus, after his translation to Constantinople, held his assemblies within the city in a small oratory, adjoining to which the emperors afterwards built a magnificent church, and named it <em>Anastasia</em>.  But Gregory, who far excelled in eloquence and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> all those of the age in which he lived, understanding that some murmured at his preferment because he was a stranger, after expressing his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at the emperor's arrival, resigned the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> of Constantinople. When the emperor found the church in this state, he began to consider by what means he could make peace, effect a union, and enlarge the churches. Immediately, therefore, he intimated his desire to Demophilus,  who presided over the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> party; and enquired whether he was willing to assent to the Nicene Creed, and thus reunite the people, and establish peace. Upon Demophilus' declining to accede to this proposal, the emperor said to him, 'Since you reject peace and harmony, I order you to quit the churches.' When Demophilus heard this, weighing with himself the difficulty of contending against superior power, he convoked his followers in the church, and standing in the midst of them, thus spoke: 'Brethren, it is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note260699"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;10:23</a></span> <q>If they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you in one city, flee ye into another.</q> Since therefore the emperor needs the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, take notice that we will henceforth hold our assemblies without the city.' Having said this he departed; not however as rightly apprehending the meaning of that expression in the Evangelist, for the real import of the sacred oracle is that such as would avoid the course of this world must seek the heavenly Jerusalem.  He therefore went outside the city gates, and there in future held his assemblies. With him also Lucius went out, who being ejected from <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, as we have before related,  had made his escape to Constantinople, and there abode. Thus the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, after having been in possession of the churches for forty years, were in consequence of their opposition to the peace proposed by the emperor Theodosius, driven out of the city, in Gratian's fifth consulate,  and the first of Theodosius Angustus, on the 26th of November. The adherents of the 'homoousian' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in this manner regained possession of the churches.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 8. A Synod consisting of One Hundred and Fifty Bishops meets at Constantinople. The Decrees passed. Ordination of Nectarius.</h2>

<p>The emperor making no delay summoned a Synod  of the prelates of his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in order that he might establish the Nicene Creed, and appoint a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople: and inasmuch as he was not without hope that he might win the Macedonians over to his own views, he invited those who presided over that <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> to be present also. There met therefore on this occasion of the Homoousian party, Timothy from <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, Cyril from Jerusalem, who at that time recognized the doctrine of <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em>,  having retracted his former opinion; Melitius from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, he having arrived there previously to assist at the installation of Gregory; Ascholius also from Thessalonica, and many others, amounting in all to one hundred and fifty. Of the Macedonians, the leaders were Eleusius of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, and Marcian of Lampsacus; these with the rest, most of whom came from the cities of the Hellespont, were thirty-six in number. Accordingly they were assembled in the month of May, under the consulate  of Eucharius and Evagrius, and the emperor used his utmost exertions, in conjunction with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who entertained similar sentiments to his own, to bring over Eleusius and his adherents to his own side. They were reminded of the deputation they had sent by Eustathius to Liberius  then <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>; that they had of their own accord not long before entered into promiscuous communion with the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>; and the inconsistency and fickleness of their conduct was represented to them, in now attempting to subvert the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they once acknowledged, and professed agreement with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in. But they paying little heed alike to admonitions and reproofs, chose rather to maintain the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> dogma, than to assent to the 'homoousian' doctrine. Having made this declaration, they departed from Constantinople; moreover they wrote to their partisans in every city, and charged them by no means to harmonize with the creed of the Nicene Synod. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the other party remaining at Constantinople, entered into a consultation about the ordination of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; for Gregory, as we have before said,  had resigned that see, and was preparing to return to Nazianzus. Now there was a person named Nectarius, of a senatorial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, mild and gentle in his manners, and admirable in his whole course of life, although he at that time bore the office of proctor. This man was seized upon by the people, and elected  to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, and was ordained accordingly by one hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> then present. The same prelates moreover published a decree,  prescribing 'that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople should have the next prerogative of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, because that city was New Rome.' They also again confirmed the Nicene Creed. Then too patriarchs were constituted, and the provinces distributed, so that no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> might exercise any jurisdiction over other churches  out of his own diocese: for this had been often indiscriminately done before, in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>. To Nectarius therefore was allotted the great city and Thrace. Helladius, the successor of Basil in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia, obtained the patriarchate of the diocese of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> in conjunction with Gregory Basil's brother, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nyssa  in Cappadocia, and Otre&iuml;us <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Melitina in Armenia. To Amphilochius of Iconium and Optimus of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in Pisidia, was the Asiatic diocese assigned. The superintendence of the churches throughout <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was committed to Timothy of Alexandria. On Pelagius of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, and Diodorus of Tarsus, devolved the administration of the churches of the East; without infringement however on the prerogatives of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> reserved to the <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antiochian</a> church, and conferred on Melitius then present. They further decreed that as necessity required it, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs of each province should be managed by a Synod of the province. These arrangements were confirmed by the emperor's approbation. Such was the result of this Synod.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The Body of Paul, Bishop of Constantinople, is honorably transferred from his Place of Exile. Death of Meletius.</h2>

<p>The emperor at that time caused to be removed from the city of Ancyra, the body of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, whom Philip the prefect of the Pr&aelig;torium  had banished at the instigation of Macedonius, and ordered to be strangled at Cucusus a town of Armenia, as I have already mentioned.  He therefore received the remains with great reverence and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and deposited in the church which now takes its name from him; which the Macedonian party were formerly in possession of while they remained separate from the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, but were expelled at that time by the emperor, because they refused to adopt his sentiments. About this period Melitius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, fell sick and died: in whose praise Gregory, the brother of Basil, pronounced a funeral oration. The body of the deceased <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was by his friends conveyed to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; where those who had identified themselves with his interests again refused subjection to Paulinus, but caused Flavian to be substituted in the place of Melitius, and the people began to quarrel anew. Thus again the <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antiochian</a> church was divided into rival factions, not grounded on any difference of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but simply on a preference of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 10. The Emperor orders a Convention composed of All the Various Sects. Arcadius is proclaimed Augustus. The Novatians permitted to hold their Assemblies in the City of Constantinople: Other Heretics driven out.</h2>

<p>Great disturbances occurred in other cities also, as the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> were ejected from the churches. But I cannot sufficiently admire the emperor's <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in this contingency. For he was unwilling to fill the cities with disturbance, as far as this was dependent on him, and so after a very short time  he called together a general conference of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, thinking that by a discussion among their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, their mutual differences might be adjusted, and unanimity established. And this purpose of the emperor's I am persuaded was the reason that his affairs were so prosperous at that time. In fact by a special dispensation of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> the barbarous nations were reduced to subjection under him: and among others, Athanaric king of the Goths made a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> surrender of himself to him,  with all his people, and died soon after at Constantinople. At this juncture the emperor proclaimed his son Arcadius Augustus, on the sixteenth of January, in the second consulate  of Merobaudes and Saturnilus. Not long afterwards in the month of June, under the same consulate, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of every <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> arrived from all places: the emperor, therefore, sent for Nectarius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and consulted with him on the best means of freeing the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> from dissensions, and reducing the church to a state of unity. 'The subjects of controversy,' said he, 'ought to be fairly discussed, that by the detection and removal of the sources of discord, a universal agreement may be effected.' Hearing this proposition Nectarius fell into uneasiness, and communicated it to Agelius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Novatians, inasmuch as he entertained the same sentiments as himself in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This man, though eminently <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, was by no means competent to maintain a dispute on doctrinal points; he therefore proposed to refer the subject to Sisinnius  his reader, as a fit person to manage a conference. Sisinnius, who was not only learned, but possessed of great experience, and was well informed both in the expositions of the sacred Scriptures and the principles of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, being convinced that disputations, far from healing divisions usually create <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of a more inveterate character, gave the following advice to Nectarius, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> well that the ancients have nowhere attributed a beginning of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, conceiving him to be co-eternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, he advised that they should avoid dialectic warfare and bring forward as evidences of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the testimonies of the ancients. 'Let the emperor,' said he, 'demand of the heads of each <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, whether they would pay any deference to the ancients who flourished before <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> distracted the church; or whether they would repudiate them, as alienated from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? If they reject their authority, then let them also <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> them: and should they presume to take such a step, they would themselves be instantly thrust out by the people, and so the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will be manifestly victorious. But if, on the other hand, they are not willing to set aside the fathers, it will then be our business to produce their books, by which our views will be fully attested.' Nectarius having heard these words of Sisinnius, hastened to the palace, and acquainted the emperor with the plan which had been suggested to him; who at once perceiving its wisdom and propriety, carried it into execution with consummate <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. For without discovering his object, he simply asked the chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> whether they had any respect for and would accept the teachings of those teachers who lived previous to the dissension in the church? As they did not repudiate them, but replied that they highly revered them as their masters; the emperor enquired of them again whether they would defer to them as accredited witnesses of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine? At this question, the leaders of the several parties, with their <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> champions,&mdash; for many had come prepared for sophistical debate&mdash;found themselves extremely embarrassed. For a division was caused among them as some acquiesced in the reasonableness of the emperor's proposition while others shrunk from it, conscious that it was by no means favorable to their interests: so that all being variously affected towards the writings of the ancients, they could no longer agree among themselves, dissenting not only from other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, but those of the same <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> differing from one another. Accordant <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> therefore, like the tongue of the giants of old, was confounded, and their tower of mischief overturned.  The emperor perceiving by their confusion that their sole confidence was in subtle arguments, and that they feared to appeal to the expositions of the fathers, had recourse to another method: he commanded every <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> to set forth in writing their own peculiar tenets. Accordingly those who were accounted the most skillful among them, drew up a statement of their respective creeds, couched in terms the most circumspect they could devise; a day was appointed, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> selected for this purpose presented themselves at the palace. Nectarius and Agelius appeared as the defenders of the 'homoousian' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; Demophilus supported the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> dogma; Eunomius himself undertook the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the Eunomians; and Eleusius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, represented the opinions of those who were denominated Macedonians. The emperor gave them all a courteous reception; and receiving from each their written avowal of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he shut himself up alone, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> very earnestly that God would assist him in his endeavors to ascertain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Then perusing with great care the statement which each had submitted to him, he condemned all the rest, inasmuch as they introduced a separation of the Trinity, and approved of that only which contained the doctrine of the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a>.</em> This decision caused the Novatians to flourish again, and hold their meetings within the city: for the emperor delighted with the agreement of their profession with that which he embraced, promulgated a law securing to them the peaceful possession of their own church buildings, and assigned to their churches equal privileges with those to which he gave his more special sanction. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, on account of their disagreement among themselves, were despised and censured even by their own followers: so that overwhelmed with perplexity and vexation they departed, addressing consolatory letters to their adherents, whom they exhorted not to be troubled because many had deserted them and gone over to the homoousian party; for they said, 'Many are called, but few chosen' <span class="stiki" id="note260719"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;20:16</a></span> &mdash; an expression which they never used when on account of force and terror the majority of the people was on their side. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> were not wholly exempt from inquietude; for the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antiochian</a> church caused divisions among those who were present at the Synod. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Arabia and <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, combined against Flavian, and insisted on his expulsion from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>: but those of Palestine, <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, contended with equal <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in his favor. What result issued from this contest I shall describe in its proper place.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 11. The Emperor Gratian is slain by the Treachery of the Usurper Maximus. From Fear of him Justina ceases persecuting Ambrose.</h2>

<p>Nearly at the same time with the holding of these Synods at Constantinople, the following events occurred in the Western parts. Maximus, from the island of Britain, rebelled against the Roman empire, and attacked Gratian, who was then wearied and exhausted in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Alemanni.  In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Valentinian being still a minor, Probus, a man of consular dignity, had the chief administration of affairs, and was at that time prefect of the Pr&aelig;torium. Justina, the mother of the young prince, who entertained <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> sentiments, as long as her husband lived had been unable to molest the Homoousians; but going to Milan while her son was still young, she manifested great hostility to Ambrose the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and commanded that he should be banished.  While the people from their excessive attachment to Ambrose, were offering resistance to those who were charged with taking him into exile, intelligence was brought that Gratian had been assassinated by the treachery of the usurper Maximus. In fact Andragathius, a general under Maximus, having concealed himself in a litter resembling a couch, which was carried by mules, ordered his guards to spread a report before him that the litter contained the <a href="../cathen/06729c.htm">Emperor Gratian's</a> wife. They met the emperor near the city of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in France just as he had crossed the river: who believing it to be his wife, and not suspecting any treachery, fell into the hands of his enemy as a blind man into the ditch; for Andragathius, suddenly springing forth from the litter, slew him.  Gratian thus perished in the consulate of Merogaudes and Saturninus,  in the twenty-fourth year of his age, and the fifteenth of his reign. When this happened the Empress Justina's indignation against Ambrose was repressed. Afterwards Valentinian most unwillingly, but constrained by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the time, admitted Maximus as his colleague in the empire. Probus alarmed at the power of Maximus, resolved to retreat into the regions of the East: leaving <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> therefore, he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>, and fixed his residence at Thessalonica a city of Macedonia.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 12. While the Emperor Theodosius is engaged in Military Preparations against Maximus, his Son Honorius is born. He then proceeds to Milan in Order to encounter the Usurper.</h2>

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> was filled with great solicitude, and levied a powerful army against the usurper, fearing lest he should meditate the assassination of the young Valentinian also. While engaged in this preparation, an embassy arrived from the Persians, requesting peace from the emperor. Then also the empress Flaccilla bore him a son named Honorius, on the 9th of September, in the consulate of Richomelius and Clearchus.  Under the same consulate, and a little previously, Agelius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Novatians died.  In the year following, wherein Arcadius Augustus bore his first consulate in conjunction with Baudon,  Timothy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria died, and was succeeded in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> by Theophilus. About a year after this, Demophilus the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> prelate having departed this life, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> sent for Marinus a leader of their own <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> out of Thrace, to whom they entrusted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>: but Marinus did not long occupy that position, for under him that <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was divided into two parties, as we shall hereafter explain;  for they invited Dorotheus  to come to them from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and constituted him their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Meanwhile the emperor Theodosius proceeded to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Maximus, leaving his son Arcadius with imperial authority at Constantinople. Accordingly arriving at Thessalonica he found Valentinian and those about him in great anxiety, because through compulsion they had acknowledged the usurper as emperor. Theodosius, however, gave no expression to his sentiments in public; he neither rejected nor admitted  the embassy of Maximus: but unable to endure tyrannical domination over the Roman empire, under the assumption of an imperial name, he hastily mustered his forces and advanced to Milan,  whither the usurper had already gone.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 13. The Ariansexcite a Tumult at Constantinople.</h2>

<p>At the time when the emperor was thus occupied on his military expedition, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> excited a great tumult at Constantinople by such devices as these. Men are fond of fabricating statements respecting matters about which they are in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; and if at any time they are given occasion they swell to a prodigious extent rumors concerning what they wish, being ever fond of change. This was strongly exemplified at Constantinople on the present occasion: for each invented news concerning the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which was carrying on at a distance, according to his own caprice, always presuming upon the most disastrous results; and before the contest had yet commenced, they spoke of transactions in reference to it, of which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing, with as much assurance as if they had been spectators on the very scene of action. Thus it was confidently affirmed that 'the usurper had defeated the emperor's army,' even the number of men slain on both sides being specified; and that 'the emperor himself had nearly fallen into the usurper's hands.' Then the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, who had been excessively exasperated by those being put in possession of the churches within the city who had previously been the objects of their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, began to augment these rumors by additions of their own. But since the currency of such stories with increasing exaggeration, in time made even the farmers themselves <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them&mdash; for those who had circulated them from hearsay, affirmed to the authors of these falsehoods, that the accounts they had received from them had been fully corroborated elsewhere; then indeed the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> were emboldened to commit acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and among other outrages, to set fire to the house of Nectarius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This was done in the second consulate  of Theodosius Augustus, which he bore with Cynegius.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Overthrow and Death of the Usurper Maximus.</h2>

<p>As the emperor marched against the usurper the intelligence of the formidable preparations made by him so alarmed the troops under Maximus, that instead of fighting for him, they delivered him bound to the emperor, who caused him to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, on the twenty-seventh of August, under the same consulate.  Andragathius, who with his own hand had slain Gratian, understanding the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of Maximus, precipitated himself into the adjacent river, and was drowned. Then the victorious emperors made their public entry into Rome, accompanied by Honorius the son of Theodosius, still a mere boy, whom his father had sent for from Constantinople immediately after Maximus had been vanquished. They continued therefore at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> celebrating their triumphal festivals: during which time the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> exhibited a remarkable instance of clemency toward Symmachus, a man who had borne the consular office, and was at the head of the senate at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For this Symmachus was distinguished for his eloquence, and many of his orations are still extant composed in the Latin tongue: but inasmuch as he had written a panegyric on Maximus, and pronounced it before him publicly, he was afterwards impeached for high treason; wherefore to escape capital punishment he took sanctuary in a church.  The emperor's veneration for religion led him not only to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his own communion, but to treat with consideration those of the Novatians also, who embraced the 'homoousian' creed: to gratify therefore Leontius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who interceded in behalf of Symmachus, he graciously pardoned him for that crime. Symmachus, after he had obtained his pardon, wrote an apologetic address to the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, which at its commencement threatened so seriously, was brought to a speedy termination.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Of Flavian Bishop of Antioch.</h2>

<p>About the same period, the following events took place at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. After the death of Paulinus, the people who had been under his superintendence refused to submit to the authority of Flavian, but caused Evagrius to be ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of their own party.  As he did not survive his ordination long, no other was constituted in his place, Flavian having brought this about: nevertheless those who disliked Flavian on account of his having violated his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, held their assemblies apart.  Meanwhile Flavian 'left no stone unturned,' as the phrase is, to bring these also under his control; and this he soon after effected, when he appeased the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of Theophilus, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria,  by whose mediation he conciliated, Damasus <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a> also. For both these had been greatly displeased with Flavian, as well for the <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> of which he had been guilty, as for the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> he had occasioned among the previously united people. Theophilus therefore being pacified, sent Isidore a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and thus reconciled Damasus, who was still offended; representing to him the propriety of overlooking Flavian's past misconduct, for the sake of producing concord among the people. Communion being in this way restored to Flavian, the people of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> were in the course of a little while induced to acquiesce in the union secured. Such was the conclusion of this affair at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> of that city being ejected from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, were accustomed to hold their meetings in the suburbs. Meanwhile Cyril <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem having died about this time,  was succeeded by John.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Demolition of the Idolatrous Temples at Alexandria, and the Consequent Conflict between the Pagans and Christians.</h2>

<p>At the solicitation of Theophilus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria the emperor issued an order at this time for the demolition of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> temples in that city; commanding also that it should be put in execution under the direction of Theophilus. Seizing this opportunity, Theophilus exerted himself to the utmost to expose the pagan <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> to contempt. And to begin with, he caused the Mithreum  to be cleaned out, and exhibited to public view the tokens of its bloody <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. Then he destroyed the Serapeum, and the bloody rights of the Mithreum he publicly caricatured; the Serapeum also he showed full of extravagant <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>, and he had the phalli of Priapus carried through the midst of the forum. The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> of Alexandria, and especially the professors of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, were unable to repress their rage at this exposure, and exceeded in revengeful ferocity their outrages on a former occasion: for with one accord, at a preconcerted signal, they rushed impetuously upon the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and murdered every one they could lay hands on. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> also made an attempt to resist the assailants, and so the mischief was the more augmented. This desperate affray was prolonged until satiety of bloodshed put an end to it. Then it was discovered that very few of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> had been killed, but a great number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; while the number of wounded on each side was almost innumerable. Fear then possessed the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> on account of what was done, as they considered the emperor's displeasure. For having done what seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in their own eyes, and by their bloodshed having quenched their <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, some fled in one direction, some in another, and many quitting Alexandria, dispersed themselves in various cities. Among these were the two grammarians Helladius and Ammonius, whose pupil I was in my youth at Constantinople.  Helladius was said to be the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Jupiter, and Ammonius of Simius.  Thus this disturbance having been terminated, the governor of Alexandria, and the commander-in-chief of the troops in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, assisted Theophilus in demolishing the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> temples. These were therefore razed to the ground, and the images of their gods molten into pots and other convenient utensils for the use of the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> church; for the emperor had instructed Theophilus to distribute them for the relief of the poor. All the images were accordingly broken to pieces, except one <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the god before mentioned, which Theophilus preserved and set up in a public place; 'Lest,' said he, 'at a future time the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> should deny that they had ever worshipped such gods.' This action gave great umbrage to Ammonius the grammarian in particular, who to my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was accustomed to say that 'the religion of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> was grossly abused in that that single <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> was not also molten, but preserved, in order to render that religion ridiculous.' Helladius however boasted in the presence of some that he had slain in that desperate onset nine men with his own hand. Such were the doings at Alexandria at that time.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Of the Hieroglyphics found in the Temple of Serapis.</h2>

<p>When the Temple of Serapis was torn down and laid bare, there were found in it, engraven on stones, certain characters which they call hieroglyphics, having the forms of crosses.  Both the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> on seeing them, appropriated and applied them to their respective <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who affirm that the cross is the sign of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> saving passion, claimed this character as peculiarly theirs; but the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> alleged that it might appertain to Christ and Serapis in common; 'for,' said they, 'it symbolizes one thing to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and another to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>.' Whilst this point was controverted among them, some of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> converts to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, who were conversant with these hieroglyphic characters, interpreted the form of a cross and said that it signifies 'Life to come.' This the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> exultingly laid hold of, as decidedly favorable to their religion. But after other hieroglyphics had been deciphered containing a prediction that 'When the cross should appear,'&mdash; for this was 'life to come,'&mdash; 'the Temple of Serapis would be destroyed,' a very great number of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> embraced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and confessing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Such are the reports I have heard respecting the discovery of this <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> in form of a cross. But I cannot <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> foreknew the things concerning Christ, when they engraved the figure of a cross. For if 'the advent' of our Saviour into the world 'was a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> hid from ages and from generations,'  as the apostle declares; and if the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself, the prince of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of it, his ministers, the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, are likely to have been still more <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the matter; but Providence doubtless purposed that in the enquiry concerning this character, there should something take place analogous to what happened heretofore at the preaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. For he, made wise by the Divine Spirit, employed a similar method in relation to the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note260743"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse23">Acts&nbsp;17:23</a></span> and brought over many of them to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when on reading the inscription on one of their altars, he accommodated and applied it to his own discourse. Unless indeed any one should say, that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> wrought in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, as it did on Balaam <span class="stiki" id="note260744"><a href="../bible/num024.htm">Numbers&nbsp;xxiv</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note260745"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse51">John&nbsp;11:51</a></span> for these men uttered prophecies of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in spite of themselves. This will suffice on the subject.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Reformation of Abuses at Rome by the Emperor Theodosius.</h2>

<p>The emperor Theodosius during his short stay in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, conferred the greatest benefit on the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, by grants on the one hand, and abrogations on the other. His largesses were indeed very munificent; and he removed two most <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> abuses which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the city. One of them was the following: there were buildings of immense magnitude, erected in ancient Rome in former times, in which bread was made for distribution among the people.  Those who had the charge of these edifices, who Mancipes  were called in the Latin language, in process of time converted them into receptacles for thieves. Now as the bake-houses in these structures were placed underneath, they build taverns at the side of each, where they kept prostitutes; by which means they entrapped many of those who went there either for the sake of refreshment, or to gratify their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, for by a certain mechanical contrivance they precipitated them from the tavern into the bake-house below. This was practiced chiefly upon strangers; and such as were in this way kidnapped were compelled to work in the bake-houses, where many of them were immured until old age, not being allowed to go out, and giving the impression to their friends that they were dead. It happened that one of the soldiers of the emperor Theodosius fell into this snare; who being shut up in the bake-house, and hindered from going out, drew a dagger which he wore and killed those who stood in his way: the rest being terrified, suffered him to escape. When the emperor was made acquainted with the circumstance he punished the Mancipes, and ordered these haunts of lawless and abandoned characters to be pulled down. This was one of the disgraceful nuisances of which the emperor purged the imperial city: the other was of this nature. When a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was detected in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, they punished the delinquent not in the way of correction but rather of aggravation of her crime. For shutting her up in a narrow brothel, they <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> her to prostitute herself in a most disgusting manner; causing little bells to be rung at the time of the unclean deed that those who passed might not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what was doing within. This was doubtless intended to brand the crime with greater ignominy in public opinion. As soon as the emperor was apprised of this indecent usage, he would by no means tolerate it; but having ordered the <em>Sistra</em>  &mdash; for so these places of penal prostitution were denominated&mdash; to be pulled down, he appointed other <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the punishment of adulteresses.  Thus did the emperor Theodosius free the city from two of its most discreditable abuses: and when he had arranged all other affairs to his satisfaction, he left the emperor Valentinian at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and returned himself with his son Honorius to Constantinople, and entered that city of the 10th of November, in the consulate of <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> and Symmachus.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Of the Office of Penitentiary Presbyters and its Abolition.</h2>

<p>At this time it was deemed requisite to abolish the office of those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in the churches who had charge of the penitences:  this was done on the following account. When the Novatians separated themselves from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> because they would not communicate with those who had lapsed during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> added to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> canon  a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of penitence in order that those who had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> might confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> thus appointed.  And this mode of discipline is still maintained among other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> institutions by all the rest of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>; the Homoousians only, together with the Novatians who hold the same doctrinal views, have abandoned it. The latter indeed would never admit of its establishment:  and the Homoousians who are now in possession of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, after retaining this function for a considerable period, abrogated it in the time of Nectarius, in consequence of an event which occured in the Constantinopolitan church, which is as follows: A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> coming to the penitentiary, made a general confession of those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> she had committed since her <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> enjoined <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> continually, that together with the acknowledgment of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, she might have to show works also meet for repentance. Some time after this, the same lady again presented herself, and confessed that she had been guilty of another crime, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the church having slept with her. When this was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> was ejected from the church:  but the people were very indignant, being not only offended at what had taken place, but also because the deed had brought scandal and degradation upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. When in consequence of this, ecclesiastics were subjected to taunting and reproach, Eud&aelig;mon a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the church, by birth an <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a>, persuaded Nectarius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to abolish the office of penitentiary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and to leave every one to his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> with regard to the participation of the sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>:  for thus only, in his judgment, could the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be preserved from obloquy. Having heard this explanation of the matter from Eud&aelig;mon I have ventured to put in the present treatise: for as I have often remarked,  I have spared no pains to procure an authentic account of affairs from those who were best acquainted with them, and to scrutinize every report, lest I should advance what might be untrue. My observation to Eud&aelig;mon, when he first related the circumstance, was this: 'Whether, O <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, your counsel has been profitable for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or otherwise, God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; but I see that it takes away the means of rebuking one another's faults, and prevents our acting upon that precept of the apostle,  <q>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</q>' Concerning this affair let this suffice.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Divisions among the Ariansand Other Heretics.</h2>

<p>I conceive it right moreover not to leave unnoticed the proceedings of the other religious bodies, viz. the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>,  Novatians, and those who received their denominations from Macedonius and Eunomius. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> once being divided, rested not in that <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, but the separatists taking occasion from the slightest and most frivolous pretences, disagreed among themselves. The manner and time, as well as the causes for which they raised mutual dissensions, we will state as we proceed. But let it be observed here, that the emperor Theodosius <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> none of them except Eunomius; but inasmuch as the latter, by holding meetings in private houses at Constantinople, where he read the works he had composed, corrupted many with his doctrines, he ordered him to be sent into exile. Of the other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> he interfered with no one; nor did he constrain them to hold communion with himself; but he allowed them all to assemble in their own conventicles, and to entertain their own opinions on points of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Permission to build themselves churches without the cities was granted to the rest: but inasmuch as the Novatians held sentiments precisely identical with his own as to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he ordered that they should be suffered to continue unmolested in their churches within the cities, as I have before noticed.  Concerning these I think it opportune, however, to give in this place some farther account, and shall therefore retrace a few circumstances in their history.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Peculiar Schism among the Novatians </h2>

<p>Of the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> church at Constantinople Agelius was the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the space of forty years,  viz. from the reign of Constantine until the sixth year of that of the emperor Theodosius, as I have stated somewhere previously.  He perceiving his end approaching, ordained Sisinnius to succeed him in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>.  This person was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the church over which Agelius presided, remarkably eloquent, and had been instructed in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> by Maximus, at the same time as the emperor Julian. Now as the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were dissatisfied with this election, and wished rather that he had ordained Marcian, a man of eminent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, on account of whose influence their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> had been left unmolested during the reign of Valens, Agelius therefore to allay his people's discontent, laid his hands on Marcian also. Having recovered a little from his illness, he went to the church and thus of his own accord addressed the congregation: 'After my decease let Marcian be your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and after Marcian, Sisinnius.' He survived these words but a short time; Marcian accordingly having been constituted <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Novatians, a division arose in their church also, from this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Marcian had promoted to the rank of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> a converted Jew named Sabbatius, who nevertheless continued to retain many of his Jewish prejudices; and moreover he was very ambitious of being made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Having therefore confidentially attached to his interest two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, Theoctistus and Macarius, who were cognizant of his designs, he resolved to defend that innovation made by the Novatians in the time of Valens, at Pazum a village of Phrygia, concerning the festival of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, to which I have already adverted.  And in the first place, under pretext of more <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> austerity, he privately withdrew from the church, saying that 'he was grieved on account of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom he suspected of being unworthy of participation in the sacrament.' It was however soon discovered that his object was to hold assemblies apart. When Marcian understood this, he bitterly censured his own <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, in ordaining to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbyterate</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> so intent on vain-<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and frequently said, 'That it had been better for him to have laid his hands on thorns, than to have imposed them on Sabbatius.' To check his proceedings, he procured a Synod of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to be convened at Angarum,  a commercial town near Helenopolis in Bithynia. On assembling here they summoned Sabbatius, and desired him to explain the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his discontent. Upon his affirming that he was troubled about the disagreement that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> respecting the Feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and that it ought to be kept according to the custom of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and agreeable to that sanction which those convened at Pazum had appointed, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present at the Synod perceiving that this assertion was a mere subterfuge to disguise his desire after the episcopal chair, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to pledge himself on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that he would never accept a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>. When he had so <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, they passed a canon respecting this feast, which they entitled 'indifferent,' declaring that 'a disagreement on such a point was not a sufficient reason for separation from the church; and that the council of Pazum had done nothing prejudicial to the catholic canon. That although the ancients who lived nearest to the times of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> differed about the observance of this festival, it did not prevent their communion with one another, nor create any dissension. Besides that the Novatians at imperial Rome had never followed the Jewish usage, but always kept <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> after the equinox; and yet they did not separate from those of their own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who celebrated it on a different day.' From these and many such considerations, they made the 'Indifferent' Canon, above-mentioned, concerning <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, whereby every one was at liberty to keep the custom which he had by predilection in this matter, if he so pleased; and that it should make no difference as regards communion, but even though celebrating differently they should be in accord in the church. After this rule had been thus established, Sabbatius being bound by his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, anticipated the fast by keeping it in private, whenever any discrepancy <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the time of the Paschal <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, and having watched all night, he celebrated the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> of the passover; then on the next day he went to church, and with the rest of the congregation partook of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. He pursued this course for many years, so that it could not be concealed from the people; in imitation of which some of the more <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and chiefly the Phrygians and Galatians, supposing they should be justified by this conduct imitated him, and kept the passover in secret after his manner. But Sabbatius afterwards disregarding the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by which he had renounced the episcopal dignity, held schismatic meetings, and was constituted <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his followers, as we shall show hereafter.  <br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 22. The Author's Views respecting the Celebration of Easter, Baptism, Fasting, Marriage, the Eucharist, and Other Ecclesiastical Rites.</h2>

<p>As we have touched the subject I deem it not unreasonable to say a few words concerning <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. It appears to me that neither the ancients nor moderns who have affected to follow the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, have had any rational foundation for contending so obstinately about it. For they have not taken into consideration the fact that when <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> was changed into <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the obligation to observe the Mosaic law and the ceremonial types ceased. And the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the matter is plain; for no law of Christ permits <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to imitate the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. On the contrary the apostle expressly forbids it; not only rejecting <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, but also deprecating contention about festival days. In his epistle to the Galatians <span class="stiki" id="note260768"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse21">Galatians&nbsp;4:21</a></span> he writes, 'Tell me ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law.' And continuing his train of argument, he demonstrates that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were in bondage as servants, but that those who have come to Christ are 'called into the liberty of sons.' <span class="stiki" id="note260769"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse13">Galatians&nbsp;5:13</a></span> Moreover he exhorts them in no way to regard 'days, and months, and years.' <span class="stiki" id="note260770"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse10">Galatians&nbsp;4:10</a></span> Again in his epistle to the Colossians <span class="stiki" id="note260771"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse16">Colossians&nbsp;2:16-17</a></span> he distinctly declares, that such observances are merely shadows: wherefore he says, 'Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of any holy-day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath-days; which are a shadow of things to come.' The same truths are also confirmed by him in the epistle to the Hebrews <span class="stiki" id="note260772"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse12">Hebrews&nbsp;7:12</a></span> in these words: 'For the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.' Neither the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, therefore, nor the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>,  have anywhere imposed the 'yoke of servitude' <span class="stiki" id="note260774"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;5:1</a></span> on those who have embraced the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but have left <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and every other feast to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by the gratitude of the recipients of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Wherefore, inasmuch as men <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> festivals, because they afford them cessation from labor: each individual in every place, according to his own pleasure, has by a prevalent custom celebrated the memory of the saving passion. The Saviour and his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> have enjoined us by no law to keep this feast: nor do the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> threaten us with any penalty, punishment, or curse for the neglect of it, as the Mosaic law does the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. It is merely for the sake of historical accuracy, and for the reproach of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, because they polluted themselves with blood on their very feasts, that it is recorded in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> that our Saviour suffered in the days of 'unleavened bread.'  The aim of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> was not to appoint festival days, but to teach a righteous life and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. And it seems to me that just as many other customs have been established in individual localities according to usage. So also the feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> came to be observed in each place according to the individual peculiarities of the peoples inasmuch as none of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> legislated on the matter. And that the observance originated not by legislation, but as a custom the facts themselves indicate. In Asia Minor most people kept the fourteenth day of the moon, disregarding the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>: yet they never separated from those who did otherwise, until Victor, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, influenced by too ardent a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, fulminated a sentence of excommunication against the Quartodecimans  in Asia. Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in France, severely censured Victor by letter for his immoderate heat;  telling him that although the ancients differed in their celebration of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, they did not desist from intercommunion. Also that <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Smyrna, who afterwards suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> under Gordian,  continued to communicate with <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, although he himself, according  to the usage of his native Smyrna, kept <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> on the fourteenth day of the moon, as Eusebius attests in the fifth book of his <em>Ecclesiastical History</em>.  While therefore some in Asia Minor observed the day above-mentioned, others in the East kept that feast on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> indeed, but differed as regards the month. The former thought the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> should be followed, though they were not exact: the latter kept <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> after the equinox, refusing to celebrate with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; 'for,' said they, 'it ought to be celebrated when the sun is in Aries, in the month called Xanthicus by the <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antiochians</a>, and April by the Romans.' In this practice, they averred, they conformed not to the modern <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who are mistaken in almost everything, but to the ancients, and to <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> according to what he has written in the third book of his <em>Jewish Antiquities</em>.  Thus these people were at issue among themselves. But all other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the Western parts, and as far as the ocean itself, are found to have celebrated <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> after the equinox, from a very ancient tradition. And in fact these acting in this manner have never disagreed on this subject. It is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as some have pretended, that the Synod under Constantine altered this festival:  for Constantine himself, writing to those who differed respecting it, recommended that as they were few in number, they could agree with the majority of their brethren. His letter will be found at length in the third book of the <em>Life of Constantine</em> by Eusebius; but the passage in it relative to <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> runs thus:  <br><br></p>

<p>'It is a becoming order which all the churches in the Western, Southern, and Northern parts of the world observe, and some places in the East also. Wherefore all on the present occasion have judged it right, and I have pledged myself that it will have the acquiescence of your <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, that what is unanimously observed in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Africa, and the whole of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, France, Britain, Libya, and all Greece, the diocese of Asia and <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and Cilicia, your wisdom also will readily embrace; considering not only that the number of churches in the aforesaid places is greater, but also that while there should be a universal concurrence in what is most reasonable, it becomes us to have nothing in common with the perfidious <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.'</p>

<p>Such is the tenor of the emperor's letter. Moreover the Quartodecimans affirm that the observance of the fourteenth day was delivered to them by the apostle John: while the Romans and those in the Western parts assure us that their usage originated with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Neither of these parties however can produce any written testimony in confirmation of what they assert. But that the time of keeping <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> in various places is dependent on usage, I infer from this, that those who agree in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, differ among themselves on questions of usage. And it will not perhaps be unseasonable to notice here the diversity of customs in the churches.  The <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> will be found to be differently observed among different people. Those at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> fast three successive weeks before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, excepting Saturdays and Sundays.  Those in Illyrica and all over Greece and Alexandria observe a fast of six weeks, which they term 'The forty days' fast.'  Others commencing their fast from the seventh week before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> three five days only, and that at intervals, yet call that time 'The forty days' fast.' It is indeed surprising to me that thus differing in the number of days, they should both give it one common appellation; but some assign one reason for it, and others another, according to their several fancies. One can see also a disagreement about the manner of abstinence from food, as well as about the number of days. Some wholly abstain from things that have life: others feed on fish only of all living creatures: many together with fish, eat fowl also, saying that according to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note260786"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse20">Genesis&nbsp;1:20</a></span> these were likewise made out of the waters. Some abstain from eggs, and all kinds of fruits: others partake of dry bread only; still others eat not even this: while others having fasted till the ninth hour,  afterwards take any sort of food without distinction. And among various nations there are other usages, for which innumerable reasons are assigned. Since however no one can produce a written command as an authority, it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> left each one to his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> in the matter, to the end that each might perform what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not by constraint or necessity. Such is the difference in the churches on the subject of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>. Nor is there less variation in regard to religious assemblies.  For although almost all churches throughout the world celebrate the sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>  of every week, yet the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Alexandria and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on account of some ancient tradition, have ceased to do this. The Egyptians in the neighborhood of Alexandria, and the inhabitants of Theba&iuml;s, hold their religious assemblies on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, but do not participate of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> in the manner usual among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in general: for after having eaten and satisfied themselves with food of all kinds, in the evening making their offerings  they partake of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. At Alexandria again, on the Wednesday  in Passion week and on Good Friday, the scriptures are read, and the doctors expound them; and all the usual services are performed in their assemblies, except the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. This practice in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> is of great antiquity, for it appears that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> most commonly taught in the church on those days. He being a very learned teacher in the Sacred Books, and perceiving that the 'impotence of the law?' <span class="stiki" id="note260792"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;8:3</a></span> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was weakened by literal explanation, gave it a spiritual interpretation; declaring that there has never been but one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, which the Saviour celebrated when he hung upon the cross: for that he then vanquished the adverse powers, and erected this as a trophy against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. In the same city of Alexandria, readers and chanters  are chosen indifferently from the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; whereas in all other churches the faithful only are promoted to these offices. I myself, also, learned of another custom in Thessaly. If a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> in that country, after taking orders, should sleep with his wife, whom he had legally married before his ordination, he would be degraded.  In the East, indeed, all clergymen, and even the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves, abstain from their wives: but this they do of their own accord, and not by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of any law; for there have been among them many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who have had children by their lawful wives, during their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. It is said that the author of the usage which obtains in Thessaly was Heliodorus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Tricca in that country; under whose name there are <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> books extant, entitled <em>Ethiopica</em>,  which he composed in his youth. The same custom prevails at Thessalonica, and in Macedonia, and in Greece. I have also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of another peculiarity in Thessaly, which is, that they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> there on the days of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> only; in consequence of which a very great number of them die without having received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. At <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> the site of the church is inverted; so that the altar does not face toward the east, but toward the west.  In Greece, however, and at Jerusalem and in Thessaly they go to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> as soon as the candles are lighted, in the same manner as the Novatians do at Constantinople. At C&aelig;sarea likewise, and in Cappadocia, and in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> expound the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> in the evening, after the candles are lighted. The Novatians of the Hellespont do not perform their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> altogether in the same manner as those of Constantinople; in most things, however, their usage is similar to that of the prevailing  church. In short, it is impossible to find anywhere, among all the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, two churches which agree exactly in their ritual respecting <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. At Alexandria no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> is allowed to address the public: a regulation which was made after <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> had raised a disturbance in that church. At Rome they fast every Saturday.  At C&aelig;sarea of Cappadocia they exclude from communion those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> as the Novatians do. The same discipline was practiced by the Macedonians in the Hellespont, and by the Quartodecimans in Asia. The Novatians in Phrygia do not admit such as have twice married;  but those of Constantinople  neither admit nor reject them openly, while in the Western parts they are openly received. This diversity was occasioned, as I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who in their respective eras governed the churches; and those who received these several <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> and usages, transmitted them as <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to their posterity. However, to give a complete catalogue of all the various customs and ceremonial observances in use throughout every city and country would be difficult&mdash; rather impossible; but the instances we have adduced are sufficient to show that the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Festival was from some remote precedent differently celebrated in every particular province. They talk at random therefore who assert that the time of keeping <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> was altered in the Nicene Synod; for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> there convened earnestly labored to reduce the first dissenting minority to uniformity of practice with the rest of the people. Now that many differences <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> even in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostolic</a> age of the church occasioned by such subjects, was not unknown even to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves, as the book of <em>The Acts</em> testifies. For when they understood that a disturbance occurred among <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> on account of a dissension of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, having all met together, they promulgated a Divine law, giving it the form of a letter. By this sanction they liberated <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from the bondage of formal observances, and all vain contention about these things; and they taught them the path of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, prescribing such things only as were conducive to its attainment. The epistle itself, which I shall here transcribe, is recorded in <em>The Acts of the Apostles.</em>  <br><br></p>

<p>'The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Cilicia. Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, saying, You must be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and keep the law; to whom we gave no such commandment: it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you, with our beloved <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, men that have hazarded their lives for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same thing by mouth. For it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: that you abstain from meats offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare well.'</p>

<p>These things indeed pleased God: for the letter expressly says, 'It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things.' There are nevertheless some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who, disregarding these precepts, suppose all fornication to be an indifferent matter; but contend about holy-days as if their lives were at stake, thus contravening the commands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and legislating for themselves, and making of none effect the decree of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: neither do they perceive that they are themselves practicing the contrary to those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> approved. It is possible easily to extend our discourse respecting <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and demonstrate that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> observe no exact rule either in the time or manner of celebrating the paschal <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>: and that the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, who are an offshoot from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, always celebrate this festival after the equinox. But this subject would require a distinct and copious treatise: I shall therefore merely add, that those who affect so much to imitate the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and are so very anxious about an accurate observance of types, ought to depart from them in no particular. For if they have chosen to be so correct, they must not only observe days and months, but all other things also, which Christ (who was 'made under the law?') <span class="stiki" id="note260801"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> did in the manner of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; or which he <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> suffered from them; or wrought typically for the good of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. He entered into a ship and taught. He ordered the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> to be made ready in an upper room. He commanded an ass that was tied to be loosed. He proposed a man bearing a pitcher of water as a sign to them for hastening their preparations for the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>. [He did] an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of other things of this nature which are recorded in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>. And yet those who suppose themselves to be justified by keeping this feast, would think it absurd to observe any of these things in a bodily manner. For no doctor ever dreams of going to preach from a ship&mdash; no person imagines it necessary to go up into an upper room to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> there&mdash; they never tie, and then loose an ass again&mdash; and finally no one enjoins another to carry a pitcher of water, in order that the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> might be fulfilled. They have <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> regarded such things as savoring rather of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are more solicitous about outward solemnities than the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of the heart; and therefore are they under the curse, because they do not discern the spiritual bearing of the Mosaic law, but rest in its types and shadows. Those who favor the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> admit the allegorical meaning of these things; and yet they wage a deadly warfare against the observance of days and months, without applying to them a similar sense: thus do they necessarily involve themselves in a common condemnation with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.<br> <br></p>

<p>But enough I think has been said concerning these things. Let us now return to the subject we were previously treating of, the fact that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> once divided did not stay with that division, but that those separated were again divided among themselves, taking occasion from the most trivial grounds. The Novatians, as I have stated, were divided among themselves on account of the feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, the controversy not being restricted to one point only. For in the different provinces some took one view of the question, and some another, disagreeing not only about the month, but the days of the week also, and other unimportant matters; in some places they hold separate assemblies because of it, in others they unite in mutual communion.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Further Dissensions among the Ariansat Constantinople. The Psathyrians.</h2>

<p>But dissensions arose among the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>  also on this account. The contentious questions which were daily agitated among them, led them to start the most absurd propositions. For whereas it has been always <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the church that God is the Father of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Word, it was asked whether God could be called 'Father' before the Son had subsistence? Thus in asserting that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was not begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but was created out 'of nothing,' and thus falling into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> on the chief and main point, they deservedly fell into absurd cavilings about a mere name. Dorotheus therefore being sent for by them from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> maintained that God neither was nor could be called Father before the Son <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. But Marinus whom they had summoned out of Thrace before Dorotheus, piqued at the superior deference which was paid to his rival, undertook to defend the contrary opinion. In consequence of these things there arose a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> among them, and being thus divided respecting this term, each party held separate meetings. Those under Dorotheus retained their original places of assembly: but the followers of Marinus built distinct <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> for themselves, and asserted that the Father had always been Father, even when the Son was not. This section of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> was denominated <em>Psathyrians</em>,  because one of the most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> defenders of this opinion was Theoctistus, a Syrian by birth, and a cake-seller [<em>Psathyrop<span dir="rtl">o</span> la</em>]  by trade. Selenas  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Goths adopted the views of this party, a man of mixed descent; he was a Goth by his father's side, but by his mother's a Phrygian, by which means he taught in the church with great readiness in both these languages. This faction however soon quarreled among themselves, Marinus disagreeing with Agapius, whom he himself had preferred to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> of Ephesus. They disputed, however, not about any point of religion, but in narrow-mindedness about precedence, in which the Goths sided with Agapius. Wherefore many of the ecclesiastics under their jurisdiction, abominating the vain-<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> contest between these two, abandoned them both, and became adherents to the 'homoousian' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> having continued thus divided among themselves during the space of thirty-five years, were reunited in the reign of Theodosius the Younger, under the consulate  of Plintha the commander-in-chief of the army, he being a member of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of Psathyrians; these were prevailed on to desist from contention. They afterwards passed a resolution, giving it all the cogency of law, that the question which had led to their separation, should never be mooted again. But this reconciliation extended no farther than Constantinople; for in other cities where any of these two parties were found, they persisted in their former separation. So much respecting the division among the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 24. The Eunomians divide into Several Factions.</h2>

<p>But neither did the followers of Eunomius remain without dissensions: for Eunomius  himself had long before this separated from Eudoxius who ordained him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, taking occasion from that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> refusal to restore to communion his master A&euml;tius who had been ejected. But those who derived their name from him were subsequently divided into several factions. For first Theophronius a Cappadocian, who had been instructed in the art of disputation by Eunomius, and had acquired a smattering  of Aristotle's <em>Categories</em>, and his <em>Book of Interpretation</em>, composed some treatises which he entitled, <em>On the Exercise of the Mind.</em> Having, however, drawn down upon himself the reprobation of his own <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, he was ejected as an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>. He afterwards held assemblies apart from them, and left behind him a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which bore his own name. Furthermore at Constantinople a certain Eutychius from some absurd dispute, withdrew from the Eunomians, and still continues to hold separate meetings. The followers of Theophronius are denominated 'Eunomiotheophronians'; and those of Eutychius have the appellation of 'Eunomieutychians.' What those nonsensical terms were about which they differed I consider unworthy of being recorded in this history, lest I should go into matters foreign to my purpose. I shall merely observe that they adulterated <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: for they do not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the name of the Trinity, but into the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  Among the Macedonians also there was for some time a division, when Eutropius a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> held separate assemblies, and Carterius did not agree with him. There are possibly in other cities <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which have emanated from these: but living at Constantinople, where I was born and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, I describe more particularly what has taken place in that city; both because I have myself witnessed some of these transactions, and also because the events which have there occurred are of pre-eminent importance, and are therefore more worth of commemoration. Let it however be understood that what I have here related happened at different periods, and not at the same time. But if any one should be desirous of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the names of the various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, he may easily satisfy himself, by reading a book entitled <em>Ancoratus</em>,  composed by Epiphanius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>: but I shall content myself with what I have already stated. The public affairs were again thrown into agitation from a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I shall now refer to.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 25. The Usurper Eugenius compasses the Death of Valentinian the Younger. Theodosius obtains a Victory over him.</h2>

<p>There was in the Western regions a grammarian named Eugenius,  who after having for some time taught the Latin language, left his school, and was appointed to service at the palace, being constituted chief secretary to the emperor. Possessing a considerable degree of eloquence, and being on that account treated with greater distinction than others, he was unable to bear his good fortune with moderation. For associating with himself Arbogastes, a native of Galatia Minor, who then had the command of a division of the army, a man harsh in manner and very bloodthirsty, he determined to usurp the sovereignty. These two therefore agreed to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> the Emperor Valentinian, having corrupted the eunuchs of the imperial bed-chamber. These, on receiving tempting promises of promotion, strangled the emperor in his sleep. Eugenius immediately assuming the supreme authority in the Western parts of the empire, conducted himself in such a manner as might be expected from a usurper. When the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> was made acquainted with these things, he was exceedingly distressed, because his defeat of Maximus had only prepared the way for fresh troubles. He accordingly assembled his military forces, and having proclaimed his son Honorius Augustus, on the 10th of January, in his own third consulate  which he bore with Abundantius, he again set out in great haste toward the Western parts, leaving both his sons invested with imperial authority at Constantinople. As he marched against Eugenius a very great number of the barbarians beyond the Danube volunteered their services, and followed him in this expedition. After a rapid march he arrived in the Gauls with a numerous army, where Eugenius awaited him, also at the head of an immense body of troops. Accordingly an engagement took place near the river Frigidus, which is [about thirty-six miles] distant [from Aquileia]. In that part of the battle where the Romans fought against their own countrymen, the conflict was doubtful: but where the barbarian auxiliaries of the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> were engaged, the forces of Eugenius had greatly the advantage. When the emperor saw the barbarians perishing, he cast himself in great agony upon the ground, and invoked the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this emergency: nor was his request unheeded; for Bacurius  his principal officer, inspired with sudden and extraordinary ardor, rushed with his vanguard to the part where the barbarians were hardest pressed, broke through the ranks of the enemy, and put to flight those who a little before were themselves engaged in pursuit. Another marvelous circumstance also occurred. A violent wind suddenly arose, which retorted upon themselves the darts cast by the soldiers of Eugenius, and at the same time drove those hurled by the imperial forces with increased impetus against their adversaries.  So prevalent was the emperor's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The success of the struggle being in this way turned, the usurper threw himself at the emperor's feet, and begged that his life might be spared: but as he lay a prostrate suppliant at the feet [of the emperor] he was beheaded by the soldiers, on the 6th of September, in the third consulate of Arcadius, and the second of Honorius.  Arbogastes, who had been the chief <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of so much mischief, having continued his flight for two days after the battle, and seeing no chance of escape, dispatched himself with his own sword.<br> <br></p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Illness and Death of Theodosius the Elder.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> was in consequence of the anxiety and fatigues connected with this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> thrown into bodily illness; and believing the disease which had attacked him would be fatal, he became more concerned about the public affairs than his own life, considering how great calamities often overtook the people after the death of their sovereign. He therefore hastily summoned his son Honorius from Constantinople, being principally desirous of setting in order the state of things in the western parts of the empire. After his son's arrival at Milan, he seemed to recover a little, and gave directions for the celebration of the games of the hippodrome on account of his victory. Before dinner he was pretty well, and a spectator of the sports; but after he had dined he became suddenly too ill to return to them, and sent his son to preside in his stead; when the night came on he died, it being the seventeenth of January, during consulate of Olybrius and Probus.  This was in the first year of the two hundred and ninety-fourth Olympiad. The emperor Theodosius lived sixty years,  and reigned sixteen. This book therefore comprehends the transactions of sixteen years and eight months.<br> <br></p>
