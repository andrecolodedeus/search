<h1>Church History (Book X)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. The Peace granted us by God.</h2>

<p>1. Thanks for all things be given unto God the Omnipotent Ruler and King of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and the greatest thanks to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the Saviour and Redeemer of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, through whom we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that peace may be always preserved for us firm and undisturbed by external troubles and by troubles of the mind.</p>

<p>2. Since in accordance with your wishes, my most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Paulinus,  we have added the tenth book of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> History to those which have preceded,  we will inscribe it to you, proclaiming you as the seal of the whole work; and we will fitly add in a perfect number the perfect panegyric upon the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>,  <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the Divine Spirit which exhorts us in the following words:</p>

<p>3. <q>Sing unto the Lord a new song, for he has done marvelous things. His right hand and his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> arm has saved him. The Lord has made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, his righteousness has he revealed in the presence of the nations.</q> </p>

<p>4. And in accordance with the utterance which commands us to sing the new song, let us proceed to show that, after those terrible and gloomy spectacles which we have described,  we are now permitted to see and celebrate such things as many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> righteous men and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of God before us desired to see upon earth and did not see, and to hear and did not hear. <span class="stiki" id="note252804"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;13:17</a></span> </p>

<p>5. But they, hastening on, obtained far better things,  being carried to heaven and the paradise of divine pleasure. But, acknowledging that even these things are greater than we deserve, we have been astonished at the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> manifested by the author of the great gifts, and rightly do we admire him, worshiping him with the whole power of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and testifying to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of those recorded utterances, in which it is said, <q>Come and see the works of the Lord, the wonders which he has done upon the earth; he removes <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> to the ends of the world, he shall break the bow and snap the spear in sunder, and shall burn the shields with fire.</q> </p>

<p>6. Rejoicing in these things which have been clearly fulfilled in our day, let us proceed with our account.</p>

<p>7. The whole race of God's enemies was destroyed in the manner indicated,  and was thus suddenly swept from the sight of men. So that again a divine utterance had its fulfillment: <q>I have seen the impious highly exalted and raising himself like the cedars of Lebanon and I have passed by, and behold, he was not and I have sought his place, and it could not be found.</q> </p>

<p>8. And finally a bright and splendid day, overshadowed by no cloud, illuminated with beams of heavenly light the churches of Christ throughout the entire world. And not even those without our communion  were prevented from sharing in the same blessings, or at least from coming under their influence  and enjoying a part of the benefits bestowed upon us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The Restoration of the Churches.</h2>

<p>1. All men, then, were freed from the oppression of the tyrants, and being released from the former ills, one in one way and another in another acknowledged the defender of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> to be the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. And we especially who placed our hopes in the Christ of God had unspeakable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, and a certain inspired <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> bloomed for all of us, when we saw every place which shortly before had been desolated by the impieties of the tyrants reviving as if from a long and death-fraught pestilence, and temples again rising from their foundations to an immense height, and receiving a splendor far greater than that of the old ones which had been destroyed.</p>

<p>2. But the supreme rulers also confirmed to us still more extensively the munificence of God by repeated ordinances in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; and personal letters of the emperor were sent to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> and gifts of money. It may not be unfitting to insert these documents, translated from the Roman into the Greek tongue, at the proper place in this book,  as in a sacred tablet, that they may remain as a memorial to all who shall come after us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. The Dedications in Every Place.</h2>

<p>1. After this was seen the sight which had been desired and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for by us all; feasts of dedication in the cities and consecrations of the newly built houses of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> took place, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled, foreigners came together from abroad, mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was exhibited between people and people, the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body were united in complete harmony.</p>

<p>2. Then was fulfilled the prophetic utterance which <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> foretold what was to take place: <q>Bone to bone and joint to joint,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note252812"><a href="../bible/eze037.htm#verse7">Ezekiel&nbsp;37:7</a></span> and whatever was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> announced in enigmatic expressions in the inspired passage.</p>

<p>3. And there was one energy of the Divine Spirit pervading all the members, and one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in all, and the same eagerness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and one hymn from all in praise of the Deity. Yea, and perfect services were conducted by the prelates, the sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> being solemnized, and the majestic institutions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> observed,  here with the singing of psalms and with the reading of the words committed to us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there with the performance of divine and mystic services; and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of the Saviour's passion were dispensed.</p>

<p>4. At the same time people of every age, both male and female, with all the power of the mind gave <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the author of their benefits, in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and thanksgiving, with a joyful mind and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And every one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present, each to the best of his ability, delivered panegyric orations, adding luster to the assembly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Panegyric on the Splendor of Affairs.</h2>

<p>1. <span class="sc">A certain</span> one of those of moderate talent,  who had composed a discourse, stepped forward in the presence of many pastors who were assembled as if for a church gathering, and while they attended quietly and decently, he addressed himself as follows to one who was in all things a most excellent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  through whose <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> the temple in <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, which was the most splendid in <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, had been erected.</p>

<p> <em>Panegyric upon the building of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, addressed to Paulinus, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>.</em></p>

<p>2. Friends and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of God who are clothed in the sacred gown and adorned with the heavenly crown of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the inspired unction and the sacerdotal garment of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and thou,  oh <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of God's new <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple, endowed by him with the wisdom of age, and yet exhibiting costly works and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of youthful and flourishing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to whom God himself, who embraces the entire world, has granted the distinguished <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of building and renewing this earthly house to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, his only begotten and <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> Word, and to his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and divine bride; &mdash; </p>

<p>3. one might call you a new Beseleel,  the architect of a divine tabernacle, or Solomon, king of a new and much better Jerusalem, or also a new Zerubabel, who added a much greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> than the former to the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; &mdash; </p>

<p>4. and you also, oh nurslings of the sacred flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, habitation of good words, school of wisdom, and august and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> auditory of religion: </p>

<p>5. It was long ago permitted us to raise <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and songs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when we learned from hearing the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> read the marvelous signs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the benefits conferred upon men by the Lord's wondrous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, being taught to say 'Oh God! We have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us the work which you did in their days, in days of old.' </p>

<p>6. But now as we no longer perceive the lofty arm  and the celestial right hand of our all-gracious God and universal King by hearsay merely or report, but observe so to speak in very deed and with our own eyes that the declarations recorded long ago are faithful and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it is permitted us to raise a second hymn of triumph and to sing with loud voice, and say, 'As we have heard, so have we seen; in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God.' </p>

<p>7. And in what city but in this newly built and God-constructed one, which is a 'church of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a pillar and foundation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,' <span class="stiki" id="note252824"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:15</a></span> concerning which also another divine oracle thus proclaims, 'Glorious things have been spoken of you, oh city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.'  Since the all-gracious God has brought us together to it, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of his Only-Begotten, let every one of those who have been summoned sing with loud voice and say, 'I was glad when they said unto me, we shall go unto the house of the Lord,'  and 'Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house and the place where your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> dwells.' </p>

<p>8. And let us not only one by one, but all together, with one spirit and one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> him and cry aloud, saying, 'Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain.'  For he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> great, and great is his house, lofty and spacious and 'comely in beauty above the sons of men.'  'Great is the Lord who alone does wonderful things';  'great is he who does great things and things past finding out, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and marvelous things which cannot be numbered'; <span class="stiki" id="note252831"><a href="../bible/job009.htm#verse10">Job&nbsp;9:10</a></span> great is he 'who changes times and seasons, who exalts and debases kings'; <span class="stiki" id="note252832"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse21">Daniel&nbsp;2:21</a></span> 'who raises up the poor from the earth and lifts up the needy from the dunghill.'  'He has put down princes from their thrones and has exalted them of low degree from the earth. The hungry he has filled with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things and the arms of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> he has broken.' <span class="stiki" id="note252834"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse52">Luke&nbsp;1:52-53</a></span> </p>

<p>9. Not only to the faithful, but also to unbelievers, has he confirmed the record of ancient events; he that works <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, he that does great things, the Master of all, the Creator of the whole world, the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, the all-merciful, the one and only God. To him let us sing the new song,  supplying in thought,  'To him who alone does great wonders: for his mercy endures forever';  'To him which smote great kings, and slew famous kings: for his mercy endures forever';  'For the Lord remembered us in our low estate and delivered us from our adversaries.' </p>

<p>10. And let us never cease to cry aloud in these words to the Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. And let us always <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> him with our mouth who is the second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our benefits, the instructor in divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, the destroyer of the impious, the slayer of tyrants, the reformer of life, Jesus, the Saviour of us who were in despair.</p>

<p>11. For he alone, as the only all-gracious Son of an all-gracious Father, in accordance with the purpose of his Father's benevolence, has willingly put on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of us who lay prostrate in corruption, and like some excellent physician, who for the sake of saving them that are ill, examines their sufferings, handles their foul sores, and reaps pain for himself from the miseries of another,  so us who were not only diseased and afflicted with terrible ulcers and wounds already mortified, but were even lying among the dead, he has saved for himself from the very jaws of death. For none other of those in heaven had such power as without harm  to minister to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of so many.</p>

<p>12. But he alone having reached our deep corruption, he alone having taken upon himself our labors, he alone having suffered the punishments due for our impieties, having recovered us who were not half dead merely, but were already in tombs and sepulchers, and altogether foul and offensive, saves us, both anciently and now, by his beneficent <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, beyond the expectation of any one, even of ourselves, and imparts liberally of the Father's benefits&mdash;he who is the giver of life and light, our great Physician and King and Lord, the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>13. For then when the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> lay buried in gloomy night and in depths of darkness through the deceitful arts of guilty <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and the power of God-hating spirits, by his simple appearing he loosed once for all the fast-bound cords of our impieties by the rays of his light, even as wax is melted.</p>

<p>14. But when malignant <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and the evil-loving <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> nearly burst with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> at such <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and kindness, and turned against us all his death-dealing forces, and when, at first, like a dog gone mad which gnashes his teeth at the stones thrown at him, and pours out his rage against his assailants upon the inanimate missiles, he leveled his ferocious <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> at the stones of the sanctuaries and at the lifeless material of the houses, and desolated the churches,&mdash; at least as he supposed&mdash;and then emitted terrible hissings and snake-like sounds, now by the threats of impious tyrants, and again by the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> edicts of profane rulers, vomiting forth death, moreover, and infecting with his deleterious and soul-destroying poisons the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> captured by him, and almost slaying them by his death-fraught <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of dead <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and causing every beast in the form of man and every kind of savage to assault us&mdash; then, indeed, the 'Angel of the great Council,'  the great Captain  of God after the mightiest soldiers of his kingdom had displayed sufficient exercise through patience and endurance in everything, suddenly appeared anew, and blotted out and annihilated his enemies and foes, so that they seemed never to have had even a name.</p>

<p>15. But his friends and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> he raised to the highest <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in the presence not only of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but also of celestial powers, of sun and moon and stars, and of the whole heaven and earth, so that now, as has never happened before, the supreme rulers, conscious of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which they have received from him, spit upon the faces of dead <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, trample upon the unhallowed <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, make sport of the ancient delusion handed down from their fathers, and acknowledge only one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the common benefactor of all, themselves included.</p>

<p>16. And they confess Christ, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, universal King of all, and proclaim him Saviour on monuments,  imperishably recording in imperial letters, in the midst of the city which rules over the earth, his righteous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and his victories over the impious. Thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Saviour is the only one from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> who has been acknowledged, even by those highest in the earth, not as a common king among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but as a trite son of the universal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who has been worshipped as very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and that rightly.</p>

<p>17. For what king that ever lived attained such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as to fill the ears and tongues of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> upon earth with his own name? What king, after ordaining such <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and wise <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, has extended them from one end of the earth to the other, so that they are perpetually read in the hearing of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>?</p>

<p>18. Who has abrogated barbarous and savage customs of uncivilized nations by his gentle and most philanthropic <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>? Who, being attacked for entire ages by all, has shown such superhuman <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as to flourish daily, and remain young throughout his life?</p>

<p>19. Who has founded a nation which of old was not even heard of, but which now is not concealed in some corner of the earth, but is spread abroad everywhere under the sun? Who has so fortified his soldiers with the arms of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, being firmer than adamant, shine brilliantly in the contests with their opponents?</p>

<p>20. What king prevails to such an extent, and even after death leads on his soldiers, and sets up trophies over his enemies, and fills every place, country and city, Greek and barbarian, with his royal dwellings, even divine temples with their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> oblations, like this very temple with its superb adornments and votive offerings, which are themselves so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> great and majestic, worthy of wonder and admiration, and clear signs of the sovereignty of our Saviour? For now, too, 'he spoke, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.'  For what was there to resist the nod of the universal King and Governor and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> himself? </p>

<p>21. A special discourse would be needed accurately to survey and explain all this; and also to describe how great the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the laborers is regarded by him who is celebrated as divine,  who looks upon the living temple which we all constitute, and surveys the house, composed of living and moving stones, which is well and surely built upon the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the chief cornerstone being <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> himself, who has been rejected not only by the builders of that ancient building which no longer stands, but also by the builders&mdash; <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> architects of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works&mdash; of the structure, which is composed of the mass of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and still endures.  But the Father has approved him both then and now, and has made him the head of the corner of this our common church.</p>

<p>22. Who that beholds this living temple of the living God formed of ourselves&mdash; this greatest and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine sanctuary, I say, whose inmost shrines are invisible to the multitude and are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies&mdash; would venture to declare it? Who is able even to look within the sacred enclosure, except the great High Priest of all, to whom alone it is permitted to fathom the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of every rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</p>

<p>23. But perhaps it is granted to another, to one only, to be second after him in the same work, namely, to the commander of this army whom the first and great High Priest himself has <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with the second place in this sanctuary, the shepherd of your divine flock who has obtained your people by the allotment and the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as if he had appointed him his own servant and interpreter, a new <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> or <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedec</a>, made like the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, remaining and continually preserved by him in accordance with the united <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of all of you.</p>

<p>24. To him therefore alone let it be granted, if not in the first place, at least in the second after the first and greatest High Priest, to observe and supervise the inmost state of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>&mdash;to him who by experience and length of time has accurately <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> each one, and who by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and care has disposed you all in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> conduct and doctrine, and is better able than any one else to give an account, adequate to the facts, of those things which he himself has accomplished with the Divine assistance.</p>

<p>25. As to our first and great High Priest, it is said,  'Whatsoever he sees the Father doing those things likewise the Son also does.' <span class="stiki" id="note252851"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;5:19</a></span> So also this one,  looking up to him as to the first teacher, with pure eyes of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, using as archetypes whatsoever things he sees him doing, produces images of them, making them so far as is possible in the same likeness, in nothing inferior to that Beseleel, whom God himself 'filled with the spirit of wisdom and understanding' <span class="stiki" id="note252853"><a href="../bible/exo035.htm#verse31">Exodus&nbsp;35:31</a></span> and with other technical and scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and called to be the maker of the temple constructed after heavenly types given in <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>.</p>

<p>26. Thus this one also bearing in his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the image of the whole Christ, the Word, the Wisdom, the Light, has formed this magnificent temple of the highest <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, corresponding to the pattern of the greater as a visible to an invisible, it is impossible to say with what greatness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, with what <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and liberality of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and with what emulation on the part of all of you, shown in the magnanimity of the contributors who have ambitiously striven in no way to be left behind by him in the execution of the same purpose. And this place&mdash;for this deserves to be mentioned first of all&mdash;which had been covered with all sorts of rubbish by the artifices of our enemies he did not overlook, nor did he yield to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of those who had brought about that condition of things, although he might have chosen some other place, for many other sites were available in the city, where he would have had less labor, and been free from trouble.</p>

<p>27. But having first aroused himself to the work, and then strengthened the whole people with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and formed them all into one great body, he fought the first contest. For he thought that this church, which had been especially besieged by the enemy, which had first suffered and endured the same <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> with us and for us, like a mother bereft of her children, should <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with us in the signal favor of the all-merciful God.</p>

<p>28. For when the Great Shepherd had driven away the wild animals and wolves and every cruel and savage beast, and, as the divine oracles say, 'had broken the jaws of the lions,'  he thought good to collect again her children in the same place, and in the most righteous manner he set up the fold of her flock, 'to put to shame the enemy and avenger,'  and to refute the impious daring of the enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p>29. And now they are not&mdash;the haters of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;for they never were. After they had troubled and been troubled for a little time, they suffered the fitting punishment, and brought themselves and their friends and their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> to total destruction, so that the declarations inscribed of old in sacred records have been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> by facts. In these declarations the divine word <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> says among other things the following concerning them:</p>

<p>30. 'The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> have drawn out the sword, they have bent their bow, to slay the righteous in heart; let their sword enter into their own heart and their bows be broken.'  And again: 'Their memorial is perished with a sound'  and 'their name have you blotted out forever and ever';  for when they also were in trouble they 'cried out and there was none to save: unto the Lord, and he heard them not.'  But 'their feet were bound together, and they fell, but we have arisen and stand upright.'  And that which was announced beforehand in these words&mdash;'O Lord, in your city you shall set at naught their image,' &mdash; has been shown to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to the eyes of all.</p>

<p>31. But having waged <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> like the giants against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  they died in this way. But she that was desolate and rejected by men received the consummation which we behold in consequence of her patience toward <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Isaiah was spoken of her:</p>

<p>32. 'Rejoice, thirsty desert, let the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and blossom as the lily, and the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> places shall blossom and be glad.' <span class="stiki" id="note252864"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;35:1</a></span> 'Be strengthened, you weak hands and feeble knees. Be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, you feeble-hearted, in your minds; be strong, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not. Behold our God recompenses judgment and will recompense, he will come and save us.'  'For,' he says, 'in the wilderness water has broken out, and a pool in thirsty ground, and the dry land shall be watered meadows, and in the thirsty ground there shall be springs of water.' </p>

<p>33. These things which were prophesied long ago have been recorded in sacred books; but no longer are they transmitted to us by hearsay merely, but in facts. This desert, this dry land, this widowed and deserted one, 'whose gates they cut down with axes like wood in a forest, whom they broke down with hatchet and hammer,'  whose books also they destroyed,  'burning with fire the sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and profaning unto the ground the habitation of his name,'  'whom all that passed by upon the way plucked, and whose fences they broke down, whom the boar out of the wood ravaged, and on which the savage wild beast fed,'  now by the wonderful power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when he wills it, has become like a lily. For at that time also she was chastened at his nod as by a careful father; 'for whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives.' </p>

<p>34. Then after being chastened in a measure, according to the necessities of the case, she is commanded to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> anew; and she blossoms as a lily and exhales her divine odor among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. 'For,' it is said, 'water has broken out in the wilderness,' <span class="stiki" id="note252872"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;35:6</a></span> the fountain of the saving bath of divine regeneration.  And now she, who a little before was a desert, 'has become watered meadows, and springs of water have gushed forth in a thirsty land.' <span class="stiki" id="note252874"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;35:7</a></span> The hands which before were 'weak' have become '<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> strong';  and these works are great and convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of strong hands. The knees, also, which before were 'feeble and infirm,' recovering their wonted strength, are moving straight forward in the path of divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and hastening to the kindred flock  of the all-gracious Shepherd.</p>

<p>35. And if there are any whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have been stupefied by the threats of the tyrants, not even they are passed by as incurable by the saving Word; but he heals them also and urges them on to receive divine comfort, saying, 'Be comforted, you who are faint-hearted; be ye strengthened, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not.' <span class="stiki" id="note252877"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;35:4</a></span> </p>

<p>36. This our new and excellent Zerubabel, having heard the word which announced beforehand, that she who had been made a desert on account of God should enjoy these things, after the bitter captivity  and the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination of desolation</a>, did not overlook the dead body; but first of all with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications propitiated the Father with the common consent of all of you, and invoking the only one that gives life to the dead as his ally and fellow-worker, raised her that was fallen, after purifying and freeing her from her ills. And he clothed her not with the ancient garment, but with such an one as he had again learned from the sacred oracles, which say clearly, 'And the latter <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of this house shall be greater than the former.' <span class="stiki" id="note252878"><a href="../bible/hag002.htm#verse9">Haggai&nbsp;2:9</a></span> </p>

<p>37. Thus, enclosing a much larger space, he fortified the outer court with a wall surrounding the whole, which should serve as a most secure bulwark for the entire edifice. </p>

<p>38. And he raised and spread out a great and lofty vestibule toward the rays of the rising sun,  and furnished those standing far without the sacred enclosure a full view of those within, almost turning the eyes of those who were strangers to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to the entrances, so that no one could pass by without being impressed by the memory of the former desolation and of the present incredible transformation. His hope was that such an one being impressed by this might be attracted and be induced to enter by the very sight.</p>

<p>39. But when one comes within the gates he does not permit him to enter the sanctuary immediately, with impure and unwashed feet; but leaving as large a space as possible between the temple and the outer entrance, he has surrounded and adorned it with four transverse cloisters, making a quadrangular space with pillars rising on every side, which he has joined with lattice-work screens of wood, rising to a suitable height; and he has left an open space  in the middle, so that the sky can be seen, and the free air bright in the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>40. Here he has placed <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of sacred purifications, setting up fountains opposite the temple which furnish an abundance of water wherewith those who come within the sanctuary may purify themselves. This is the first halting-place of those who enter; and it furnishes at the same time a beautiful and splendid scene to every one, and to those who still need elementary instruction a fitting station.</p>

<p>41. But passing by this spectacle, he has made open entrances to the temple with many other vestibules within, placing three doors on one side, likewise facing the rays of the sun. The one in the middle, adorned with plates of bronze, iron bound, and beautifully embossed, he has made much higher and broader than the others, as if he were making them guards for it as for a queen.</p>

<p>42. In the same way, arranging the number of vestibules for the corridors on each side of the whole temple, he has made above them various openings into the building, for the purpose of admitting more light, adorning them with very fine wood-carving. But the royal house he has furnished with more beautiful and splendid materials, using unstinted liberality in his disbursements.</p>

<p>43. It seems to me superfluous to describe here in detail the length and breadth of the building, its splendor and its majesty surpassing description, and the brilliant appearance of the work, its lofty pinnacles reaching to the heavens, and the costly cedars of Lebanon above them, which the divine oracle has not omitted to mention, saying, 'The trees of the Lord shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and the cedars of Lebanon which he has planted.' </p>

<p>44. Why need I now describe the skillful architectural arrangement and the surpassing beauty of each part, when the testimony of the eye renders instruction through the ear superfluous? For when he had thus completed the temple, he provided it with lofty thrones in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of those who preside, and in addition with seats arranged in proper order throughout the whole building, and finally placed in the middle  the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies, the altar, and, that it might be inaccessible to the multitude, enclosed it with wooden lattice-work, accurately wrought with artistic carving, presenting a wonderful sight to the beholders.</p>

<p>45. And not even the pavement was neglected by him; for this too he adorned with beautiful marble of every variety. Then finally he passed on to the parts without the temple, providing spacious exedr&aelig; and buildings  on each side, which were joined to the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>, and communicated with the entrances to the interior of the structure. These were erected by our most peaceful  Solomon, the maker of the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for those who still needed purification and sprinkling by water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> quoted above is no longer a word merely, but a fact; for now it has also come to pass that in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> 'the latter <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of this house is greater than the former.' <span class="stiki" id="note252886"><a href="../bible/hag002.htm#verse9">Haggai&nbsp;2:9</a></span> </p>

<p>46. For it was necessary and fitting that as her shepherd and Lord had once tasted death for her, and after his suffering had changed that vile body which he assumed in her behalf into a splendid and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> body, leading the very flesh which had been delivered  from corruption to incorruption, she too should enjoy the dispensations of the Saviour. For having received from him the promise of much greater things than these, she desires to share uninterruptedly throughout <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of light, in the far greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of regeneration, <span class="stiki" id="note252888"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;19:28</a></span> in the resurrection of an incorruptible body, in the palace of God beyond the heavens, with Christ Jesus himself, the universal Benefactor and Saviour.</p>

<p>47. But for the present, she that was formerly widowed and desolate is clothed by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God with these flowers, and has become <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> like a lily, as the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> says,  and having received the bridal garment and the crown of beauty, she is taught by Isaiah to dance, and to present her thank-offerings unto God the King in reverent words.</p>

<p>48. Let us hear her saying, 'My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord; for he has clothed me with a garment of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and with a robe of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>; he has bedecked me like a bridegroom with a garland, and he has adorned me like a bride with jewels; and like the earth which brings forth her bud, and like a garden which causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth, thus the Lord God has caused righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.' <span class="stiki" id="note252890"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;61:10-11</a></span> </p>

<p>49. In these words she exults. And in similar words the heavenly bridegroom, the Word <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> himself, answers her. Hear the Lord saying, 'Fear not because you have been put to shame, neither be confounded because you have been rebuked; for you shall forget the former shame, and the reproach of your widowhood shall you remember no more.'  'Not  as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> deserted and faint-hearted has the Lord called you, nor as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> from her youth, says your God. For a small moment have I forsaken you, but with great mercy will I have mercy upon you; in a little <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> I hid my face from you, but with everlasting mercy will I have mercy upon you, says the Lord that has redeemed you.' <span class="stiki" id="note252893"><a href="../bible/isa054.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;54:6-8</a></span> </p>

<p>50. 'Awake, awake, you who have drunk at the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the cup of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">fury</a>; for you have drunk the cup of ruin, the vessel of my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and have drained it. And there was none to console you of all your sons whom you brought forth, and there was none to take you by the hand.'  'Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of ruin, the vessel of my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">fury</a>, and you shall no longer drink it. And I will put it into the hands of them that have treated you <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> and have humbled you.' </p>

<p>51. 'Awake, awake, put on your strength, put on your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Shake off the dust and arise. Sit down, loose the bands of your neck.'  'Lift up your eyes round about and behold your children gathered together; behold they are gathered together and have come to you. As I live, says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, you shall clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament, and gird yourself with them as with the ornaments of a bride. For your waste and corrupted and ruined places shall now be too narrow by reason of those that inhabit you, and they that swallow you up shall be far from you.</p>

<p>52. For your sons whom you have lost shall say in your ears, The place is too narrow for me, give me a place that I may dwell. Then shall you say in your heart, Who has begotten me these? I am childless and a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and who has brought up these for me? I was left alone, and these, where were they for me?' </p>

<p>53. These are the things which Isaiah foretold; and which were anciently recorded concerning us in sacred books and it was necessary that we should sometime learn their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a> by their fulfillment.</p>

<p>54. For when the bridegroom, the Word, addressed such language to his own bride, the sacred and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, this bridesman, &mdash; when she was desolate and lying like a corpse, bereft of hope in the eyes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash;in accordance with the united <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of all of you, as was proper, stretched out your hands and aroused and raised her up at the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the universal King, and at the manifestation of the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; and having raised her he established her as he had learned from the description given in the sacred oracles.</p>

<p>55. This is indeed a very great wonder, passing all admiration, especially to those who attend only to the outward appearance; but more wonderful than wonders are the archetypes and their mental prototypes and divine models; I mean the reproductions of the inspired and rational building in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</p>

<p>56. This the Divine Son himself created after his own image, imparting to it everywhere and in all respects the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, an incorruptible nature, incorporeal, rational, free from all earthly matter, a being endowed with its own intelligence; and when he had once called her forth from non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, he made her a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spouse, an all-sacred temple for himself and for the Father. This also he clearly declares and confesses in the following words: 'I will dwell in them and will walk in them; and I will be their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they shall be my people.' <span class="stiki" id="note252899"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:16</a></span> Such is the perfect and purified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so made from the beginning as to bear the image of the celestial Word.</p>

<p>57. But when by the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the malignant <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> she became, of her own <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> choice, sensual and a lover of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the Deity left her; and as if bereft of a protector, she became an easy prey and readily accessible to those who had long envied her; and being assailed by the batteries and machines of her invisible enemies and spiritual foes, she suffered a terrible fall, so that not one stone of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> remained upon another in her, but she lay completely dead upon the ground, entirely divested of her natural ideas of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>58. But as she, who had been made in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thus lay prostrate, it was not that wild boar from the forest which we see that despoiled her, but a certain destroying <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> and spiritual wild beasts who deceived her with their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as with the fiery darts of their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and burned the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine sanctuary of God with fire, and profaned to the ground the tabernacle of his name. Then burying the miserable one with heaps of earth, they destroyed every hope of deliverance.</p>

<p>59. But that divinely bright and saving Word, her protector, after she had suffered the merited punishment for her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, again restored her, securing the favor of the all-merciful Father.</p>

<p>60. Having won over first the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the highest rulers, he purified, through the agency of those most divinely favored princes, the whole earth from all the impious destroyers, and from the terrible and God-hating tyrants themselves. Then bringing out into the light those who were his friends, who had long before been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to him for life, but in the midst, as it were, of a storm of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, had been concealed under his shelter, he <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> them worthily with the great gifts of the Spirit. And again, by means of them, he cleared out and cleaned with spades and mattocks&mdash; the admonitory words of doctrine &mdash; the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which a little while before had been covered with filth and burdened with every kind of matter and rubbish of impious ordinances.</p>

<p>61. And when he had made the ground of all your minds clean and clear, he finally committed it to this all-wise and God-beloved Ruler, who, being endowed with judgment and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as well as with other gifts, and being able to examine and discriminate accurately the minds of those committed to his charge, from the first day, so to speak, down to the present, has not ceased to build.</p>

<p>62. Now he has supplied the brilliant gold, again the refined and unalloyed silver, and the precious and costly stones in all of you, so that again is fulfilled for you in facts a sacred and mystic <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, which says, 'Behold I make your stone a carbuncle, and your foundations of sapphire, and your battlements of jasper, and your gates of crystals, and your wall of chosen stones; and all your sons shall be taught of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and your children shall enjoy complete peace; and in righteousness shall you be built.' </p>

<p>63. Building therefore in righteousness, he divided the whole people according to their strength. With some he fortified only the outer enclosure, walling it up with unfeigned <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; such were the great mass of the people who were incapable of bearing a greater structure. Others he permitted to enter the building, commanding them to stand at the door and act as guides for those who should come in; these may be not unfitly compared to the vestibules of the temple. Others he supported by the first pillars which are placed without about the quadrangular hall, initiating them into the first elements of the letter of the four <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. Still others he joined together about the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> on both sides; these are the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> who are still advancing and progressing, and are not far separated from the inmost view of divine things granted to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.</p>

<p>64. Taking from among these the pure <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that have been cleansed like gold by divine washing,  he then supports them by pillars, much better than those without, made from the inner and mystic teachings of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, and illumines them  by windows.</p>

<p>65. Adorning the whole temple with a great vestibule of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the one universal King and only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and placing on either side of the authority of the Father Christ, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as second lights, he exhibits abundantly and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> throughout the entire building the clearness and splendor of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the rest in all its details. And having selected from every quarter the living and moving and well-prepared stones of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, he constructs out of them all the great and royal house, splendid and full of light both within and without; for not only <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and understanding, but their body also is made <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> by the blooming ornament of purity and modesty.</p>

<p>66. And in this temple there are also thrones, and a great number of seats and benches, in all those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in which sit the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit's</a> gifts, such as were anciently seen by the sacred <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and those who were with them, when there 'appeared unto them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire, and sat upon each one of them.' <span class="stiki" id="note252904"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;2:3</a></span> </p>

<p>67. But in the leader of all it is reasonable to suppose  that Christ himself dwells in his fullness,  and in those that occupy the second rank after him, in proportion as each is able to contain the power of Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.  And the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of some of those, namely, who are committed to each of them for instruction and care&mdash; may be seats for <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>68. But the great and august and unique altar, what else could this be than the pure <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the common <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of all? Standing at the right of it, Jesus himself, the great High Priest of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the Only Begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, receives with bright eye and extended hand the sweet <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> from all, and the bloodless and immaterial <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered in their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and bears them to the heavenly Father and God of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. And he himself first worships him, and alone gives to the Father the reverence which is his due, beseeching him also to continue always kind and propitious to us all.</p>

<p>69. Such is the great temple which the great Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the Word, has built throughout the entire world, making it an intellectual image upon earth of those things which lie above the vault of heaven, so that throughout the whole creation, including rational beings on earth, his Father might be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> and adored.</p>

<p>70. But the region above the heavens, with the models of earthly things which are there, and the so-called Jerusalem above,  and the heavenly Mount of Zion, and the supramundane city of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which innumerable choirs of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the first born, whose names are written in heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note252909"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse22">Hebrews&nbsp;12:22-23</a></span> praise their Maker and the Supreme Ruler of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> with <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of praise unutterable and incomprehensible to us&mdash;who that is mortal is able worthily to celebrate this? 'For eye has not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of men those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has prepared for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him.' <span class="stiki" id="note252910"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> </p>

<p>71. Since we, men, children, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, small and great, are already in part partakers of these things, let us not cease all together, with one spirit and one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to confess and praise the author of such great benefits to us, 'Who forgives all our iniquities, who heals all our diseases, who redeems our life from destruction, who crowns us with mercy and compassion, who satisfies our desires with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.'  'For he has not dealt with us according to our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities;'  'for as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our iniquities from us. Like as a father pities his own children, so the Lord pities them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> him.' </p>

<p>72. Rekindling these thoughts in our memories, both now and during all time to come, and contemplating in our mind night and day, in every hour and with every breath, so to speak, the Author and Ruler of the present festival, and of this bright and most splendid day, let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and adore him with every power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And now rising, let us beseech him with loud voice to shelter and preserve us to the end in his fold, granting his unbroken and unshaken peace forever, in Christ Jesus our Saviour; through whom be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> unto him forever and ever.  <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Copies of Imperial Laws.</h2> 

<p>1. Let us finally subjoin the translations from the Roman tongue of the imperial decrees of Constantine and Licinius.</p>

<h3>Copy of imperial decrees translated from the Roman tongue.</h3> 

<p>2. Perceiving long ago that religious liberty ought not to be denied, but that it ought to be granted to the judgment and desire of each individual to perform his religious duties according to his own choice, we had given orders that every man, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as well as others, should preserve the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> and religion. </p>

<p>3. But since in that rescript, in which such liberty was granted them, many and various conditions  seemed clearly added, some of them, it may be, after a little retired from such observance.</p>

<p>4. When I, Constantine Augustus, and I, Licinius Augustus, came under favorable auspices to Milan and took under consideration everything which pertained to the common good and prosperity, we resolved among other things, or rather first of all, to make such decrees as seemed in many respects for the benefit of every one; namely, such as should preserve reverence and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> toward the deity. We resolved, that is, to grant both to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> freedom to follow the religion which they choose, that whatever heavenly divinity exists  may be propitious to us and to all that live under our government.</p>

<p>5. We have, therefore, determined, with sound and upright purpose, that liberty is to be denied to no one, to choose and to follow the religious observances of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but that to each one freedom is to be given to devote his mind to that religion which he may think adapted to himself,  in order that the Deity may exhibit to us in all things his accustomed care and favor.</p>

<p>6. It was fitting that we should write that this is our pleasure, that those conditions  being entirely left out which were contained in our former letter concerning the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> which was sent to your devotedness, everything that seemed very severe and foreign to our mildness may be annulled, and that now every one who has the same desire to observe the religion of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> may do so without molestation.</p>

<p>7. We have resolved to communicate this most fully to your care, in order that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we have granted to these same <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> freedom and full liberty to observe their own religion.</p>

<p>8. Since this has been granted freely by us to them, your devotedness perceives that liberty is granted to others also who may wish to follow their own religious observances; it being clearly in accordance with the tranquillity of our times, that each one should have the liberty of choosing and worshiping whatever deity he pleases. This has been done by us in order that we might not seem in any way to discriminate against any rank or religion. </p>

<p>9. And we decree still further in regard to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that their places, in which they were formerly accustomed to assemble, and concerning which in the former letter sent to your devotedness a different command was given,  if it appear that any have bought them either from our treasury or from any other person, shall be restored to the said <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, without demanding money or any other equivalent, with no delay or hesitation.</p>

<p>10. If any happen to have received the said places as a gift, they shall restore them as quickly as possible to these same <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>: with the understanding that if those who have bought these places, or those who have received them as a gift, demand anything from our bounty, they may go to the judge of the district, that provision may be made for them by our clemency. All these things are to be granted to the society of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by your care immediately and without any delay.</p>

<p>11. And since the said <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have possessed not only those places in which they were accustomed to assemble, but also other places, belonging not to individuals among them, but to the society  as a whole, that is, to the society of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, you will command that all these, in virtue of the law which we have above stated, be restored, without any hesitation, to these same <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; that is, to their society and congregation: the above-mentioned provision being of course observed, that those who restore them without price, as we have before said, may expect indemnification from our bounty.</p>

<p>12. In all these things, for the benefit of the aforesaid society of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, you are to use the utmost diligence, to the end that our command may be speedily fulfilled, and that in this also, by our clemency, provision may be made for the common and public tranquillity. </p>

<p>13. For by this means,  as we have said before, the divine favor toward us which we have already experienced in many matters will continue sure through all time.</p>

<p>14. And that the terms of this our gracious ordinance may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all, it is expected that this which we have written will be published everywhere by you and brought to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all, in order that this gracious ordinance of ours may remain unknown to no one.</p>

<h3>Copy of another imperial decree which they issued, indicating that the grant was made to the Catholic Church alone.</h3> 

<p>15. Greeting to you, our most esteemed Anulinus. It is the custom of our benevolence, most esteemed Anulinus, to will that those things which belong of right to another should not only be left unmolested, but should also be restored. </p>

<p>16. Wherefore it is our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that when you receive this letter, if any such things belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, in any city or other place, but are now held by citizens  or by any others, you shall <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to be restored immediately to the said churches. For we have already determined that those things which these same churches formerly possessed shall be restored to them.</p>

<p>17. Since therefore your devotedness perceives that this command of ours is most explicit, do thou make haste to restore to them, as quickly as possible, everything which formerly belonged to the said churches,&mdash; whether gardens or buildings or whatever they may be&mdash;that we may learn that you have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> this decree of ours most carefully. Farewell, our most esteemed and beloved Anulinus.</p>

<h3>Copy of an epistle in which the Emperor commands that a synod of bishopsbe held at Rome in behalf of the unity and concord of the churches.</h3> 

<p>18. Constantine Augustus to Miltiades,  <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, and to Marcus.  Since many such communications have been sent to me by Anulinus,  the most illustrious proconsul of Africa, in which it is said that C&aelig;cilianus,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, has been accused by some of his colleagues in Africa, in many matters;  and since it seems to me a very serious thing that in those provinces which <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> has freely entrusted to my devotedness, and in which there is a great population, the multitude are found following the baser course, and dividing, as it were, into two parties, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are at variance&mdash;</p>

<p>19. it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to me that C&aelig;cilianus himself, with ten of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that appear to accuse him, and with ten others whom he may consider necessary for his defense, should sail to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that there, in the presence of yourselves and of Retecius  and Maternus  and Marinus,  your colleagues, whom I have commanded to hasten to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for this purpose,  he may be heard, as you may understand to be in accordance with the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> law.</p>

<p>20. But in order that you may be enabled to have most perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all these things, I have subjoined to my letter copies of the documents sent to me by Anulinus, and have sent them to your above-mentioned colleagues. When your firmness has read these, you will consider in what way the above-mentioned case may be most accurately investigated and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> decided. For it does not escape your diligence that I have such reverence for the legitimate  <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that I do not wish you to leave <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> or division in any place. May the divinity of the great God preserve you, most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> sirs, for many years.</p>

<p> <em>Copy of an epistle in which the emperor commands another synod to be held for the purpose of removing all dissensions among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</em></p>

<p>21. Constantine Augustus to Chrestus,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Syracuse. When some began wickedly and perversely to disagree  among themselves in regard to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> worship and celestial power and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine,  wishing to put an end to such disputes among them, I formerly gave command that certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be sent from <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, and that the opposing parties who were contending persistently and incessantly with each other, should be summoned from Africa; that in their presence, and in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, the matter which appeared to be causing the disturbance might be examined and decided with all care. </p>

<p>22. But since, as it happens, some, forgetful both of their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and of the reverence due to the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion, do not even yet bring hostilities to an end, and are unwilling to conform to the judgment already passed, and assert that those who expressed their opinions and decisions were few, or that they had been too hasty and precipitate in giving judgment, before all the things which ought to have been accurately investigated had been examined&mdash;on account of all this it has happened that those very ones who ought to hold brotherly and harmonious relations toward each other, are shamefully, or rather abominably,  divided among themselves, and give occasion for ridicule to those men whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are aliens to this most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion. Wherefore it has seemed necessary to me to provide that this dissension, which ought to have ceased after the judgment had been already given by their own <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> agreement, should now, if possible, be brought to an end by the presence of many.</p>

<p>23. Since, therefore, we have commanded a number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from a great many different places  to assemble in the city of Arles,  before the kalends of August, we have thought proper to write to you also that you should secure from the most illustrious Latronianus,  corrector of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>,  a public vehicle, and that you should take with you two others of the second rank,  whom you yourself shall choose, together with three servants who may serve you on the way, and betake yourself to the above-mentioned place before the appointed day; that by your firmness, and by the wise unanimity and harmony of the others present, this dispute, which has disgracefully continued until the present time, in consequence of certain shameful strifes, after all has been heard which those have to say who are now at variance with one another, and whom we have likewise commanded to be present, may be settled in accordance with the proper <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that brotherly harmony, though it be but gradually, may be restored.</p>

<p>24. May the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> preserve you in health for many years.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. &mdash; Copy of an Imperial Epistle in which Money is granted to the Churches.</h2> 

<p>1. <span class="sc">Constantine Augustus</span> to C&aelig;cilianus,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. Since it is our pleasure that something should be granted in all the provinces of Africa and Numidia and Mauritania to certain ministers of the legitimate  and most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> catholic religion, to defray their expenses, I have written to Ursus,  the illustrious finance minister  of Africa, and have directed him to make provision to pay to your firmness three thousand folles. </p>

<p>2. Do thou therefore,  when you have received the above sum of money, command that it be distributed among all those mentioned above, according to the brief  sent to you by Hosius. </p>

<p>3. But if you should find that anything is wanting for the fulfillment of this purpose of mine in regard to all of them, you shall demand without hesitation from Heracleides,  our treasurer,  whatever you find to be necessary. For I commanded him when he was present that if your firmness should ask him for any money, he should see to it that it be paid without delay.</p>

<p>4. And since I have learned that some men of unsettled mind wish to turn the people from the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and catholic Church by a certain method of shameful corruption,  do you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I gave command to Anulinus, the proconsul, and also to Patricius,  vicar of the prefects,  when they were present, that they should give proper attention not only to other matters but also above all to this, and that they should not overlook such a thing when it happened. Wherefore if you should see any such men continuing in this <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, do thou without delay go to the above-mentioned judges and report the matter to them; that they may correct them as I commanded them when they were present.  The divinity of the great God preserve you for many years.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Exemption of the Clergy.</h2>

<h3>Copy of an Epistle in which the emperor commands that the rulers of the churches be exempted from all political duties.</h3> 

<p>1. Greeting to you, our most esteemed Anulinus. Since it appears from many circumstances that when that religion is despised, in which is preserved the chief reverence for the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> celestial Power, great dangers are brought upon public affairs; but that when legally adopted and observed  it affords the most signal prosperity to the Roman name and remarkable felicity to all the affairs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, through the divine beneficence&mdash;it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to me, most esteemed Anulinus, that those men who give their services with due <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and with constant observance of this law, to the worship of the divine religion, should receive recompense for their labors.</p>

<p>2. Wherefore it is my will that those within the province entrusted to you,  in the catholic Church, over which C&aelig;cilianus presides,  who give their services to this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion, and who are commonly called clergymen, be entirely exempted from all public duties, that they may not by any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> negligence be drawn away from the service due to the Deity, but may devote themselves without any hindrance to their own law. For it seems that when they show greatest reverence to the Deity, the greatest benefits accrue to the state. Farewell, our most esteemed and beloved Anulinus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. The Subsequent Wickedness of Licinius, and his Death.</h2>

<p>1. Such blessings did divine and heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> confer upon us through the appearance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, and such was the abundance of benefits which prevailed among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in consequence of the peace which we enjoyed. And thus were our affairs crowned with rejoicings and festivities.</p>

<p>2. But malignant <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> who loves that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, were not able to bear the sight of these things; and moreover the events that befell the tyrants whom we have already mentioned were not sufficient to bring Licinius to sound reason.</p>

<p>3. For the latter, although his government was prosperous and he was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with the second rank after the great Emperor Constantine, and was connected with him by the closest ties of marriage, abandoned the imitation of good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and emulated the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the impious tyrants whose end he had seen with his own eyes, and chose rather to follow their principles than to continue in friendly relations with him who was better than they. Being <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of the common benefactor he waged an impious and most terrible <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against him, paying regard neither to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature, nor treaties, nor blood, and giving no thought to covenants. </p>

<p>4. For Constantine, like an all-gracious emperor, giving him evidences of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> favor, did not refuse alliance with him, and did not refuse him the illustrious marriage with his sister, but <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> him by making him a partaker of the ancestral nobility and the ancient imperial blood,  and granted him the right of sharing in the dominion over all as a brother-in-law and co-regent, conferring upon him the government and administration of no less a portion of the Roman provinces than he himself possessed. </p>

<p>5. But Licinius, on the contrary, pursued a course directly opposite to this; forming daily all kinds of plots against his superior, and devising all sorts of mischief, that he might repay his benefactor with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. At first he attempted to conceal his preparations, and pretended to be a friend, and practiced frequently fraud and deceit, in the hope that he might easily accomplish the desired end. </p>

<p>6. But God was the friend, protector, and guardian of Constantine, and bringing the plots which had been formed in secrecy and darkness to the light, he foiled them. So much <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does the great armor of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> possess for the warding off of enemies and for the preservation of our own safety. Protected by this, our most divinely favored emperor escaped the multitudinous plots of the abominable man.</p>

<p>7. But when Licinius perceived that his secret preparations by no means progressed according to his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>&mdash;for God revealed every plot and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to the God-favored emperor&mdash;being no longer able to conceal himself, he undertook an open <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. </p>

<p>8. And at the same time that he determined to wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Constantine, he also proceeded to join battle with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that Constantine worshipped, and began, gently for a time and quietly, to attack his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> subjects, who had never done his government any harm.  This he did under the compulsion of his innate <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> which drove him into terrible blindness.</p>

<p>9. He did not therefore keep before his eyes the memory of those who had <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> before him, nor of those whose destroyer and executioner he had been appointed, on account of the impieties which they had committed. But departing from sound reason, being seized, in a word, with insanity, he determined to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against God himself as the ally of Constantine, instead of against the one who was assisted by him.</p>

<p>10. And in the first place, he drove from his house every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, thus depriving himself, wretched man, of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which they offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in his behalf, which they are accustomed, according to the teaching of their fathers, to offer for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Then he commanded that the soldiers in the cities should be cashiered and stripped of their rank unless they chose to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. And yet these were small matters when compared with the greater things that followed.</p>

<p>11. Why is it necessary to relate minutely and in detail all that was done by the hater of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to recount how this most lawless man invented unlawful <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>?  He passed an ordinance that no one should exercise humanity toward the sufferers in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> by giving them food, and that none should show mercy to those that were perishing of hunger in bonds; that no one should in any way be kind, or do any good act, even though moved by Nature herself to sympathize with one's neighbors. And this was indeed an openly shameful and most cruel law, calculated to expel all natural kindliness. And in addition to this it was also decreed, as a punishment, that those who showed compassion should suffer the same things with those whom they compassionated; and that those who kindly ministered to the suffering should be thrown into bonds and into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and should endure the same punishment with the sufferers. Such were the decrees of Licinius.</p>

<p>12. Why should we recount his innovations in regard to marriage or in regard to the dying&mdash; innovations by which he ventured to annul the ancient <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Romans which had been well and wisely formed, and to introduce certain barbarous and cruel <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, which were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> unlawful and lawless?  He invented, to the detriment of the provinces which were subject to him, innumerable prosecutions,  and all sorts of methods of extorting gold and silver, new measurements of land  and injurious exactions from men in the country, who were no longer living, but long since dead.</p>

<p>13. Why is it necessary to speak at length of the banishments which, in addition to these things, this enemy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> inflicted upon those who had done no wrong, the expatriations of men of noble birth and high <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> whose young wives he snatched from them and consigned to certain baser fellows of his own, to be shamefully abused by them, and the many married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> upon whom he gratified his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, although he was in advanced age &mdash; why, I say, is it necessary to speak at length of these things, when the excessive <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of his last <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> makes the first appear small and of no account?</p>

<p>14. For, finally, he reached such a pitch of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> that he attacked the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, supposing that they&mdash; as servants of the God over all&mdash; would be hostile to his measures. He did not yet proceed against them openly, on account of his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of his superior, but as before, secretly and craftily, employing the treachery of the governors for the destruction of the most distinguished of them. And the manner of their <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> was strange, and such as had never before been heard of.</p>

<p>15. The <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which he performed at Amaseia  and in the other cities of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> surpassed every excess of cruelty. Some of the churches of God were again razed to the ground, others were closed, so that none of those accustomed to frequent them could enter them and render the worship due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>16. For his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> led him to suppose that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were not offered in his behalf; but he was persuaded that we did everything in the interest of the God-beloved emperor, and that we supplicated God for him.  Therefore he hastened to turn his fury against us.</p>

<p>17. And then those among the governors who wished to flatter him, perceiving that in doing such things they pleased the impious tyrant,  made some of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> suffer the penalties customarily inflicted upon criminals, and led away and without any pretext punished like murderers those who had done no wrong. Some now endured a new form of death: having their bodies cut into many pieces with the sword, and after this savage and most horrible spectacle, being thrown into the depths of the sea as food for fishes.</p>

<p>18. Thereupon the worshipers of God again fled, and fields and deserts, forests and mountains, again received the servants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And when the impious tyrant had thus met with success in these measures, he finally planned to renew the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against all.</p>

<p>19. And he would have succeeded in his design, and there would have been nothing to hinder him in the work, had not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the defender of the lives of his own people, most quickly anticipated that which was about to happen, and caused a great light to shine forth as in the midst of a dark and gloomy night, and raised up a deliverer for all, leading into those regions with a lofty arm, his servant, Constantine.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The Victory of Constantine, and the Blessings which under him accrued to the Subjects of the Roman Empire.</h2>

<p>1. To him, therefore, God granted, from heaven above, the deserved fruit of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, the trophies of victory over the impious, and he cast the guilty one with all his counselors and friends prostrate at the feet of Constantine.</p>

<p>2. For when Licinius carried his <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to the last extreme, the emperor, the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thinking that he ought no longer to be tolerated, acting upon the basis of sound judgment, and mingling the firm principles of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> with humanity, gladly determined to come to the protection of those who were oppressed by the tyrant, and undertook, by putting a few destroyers out of the way, to save the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. </p>

<p>3. For when he had formerly exercised humanity alone and had shown mercy to him who was not worthy of sympathy, nothing was accomplished; for Licinius did not renounce his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but rather increased his fury against the peoples that were subject to him, and there was left to the afflicted no hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, oppressed as they were by a savage beast.</p>

<p>4. Wherefore, the protector of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, mingling <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for good, went forth with his son Crispus, a most beneficent prince,  and extended a saving right hand to all that were perishing. Both of them, father and son, under the protection, as it were, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the universal King, with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the Saviour of all, as their leader and ally, drew up their forces on all sides against the enemies of the Deity and won an easy victory;  God having prospered them in the battle in all respects according to their wish.</p>

<p>5. Thus, suddenly, and sooner than can be told, those who yesterday and the day before breathed death and threatening were no more, and not even their names were remembered, but their inscriptions and their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> suffered the merited disgrace. And the things which Licinius with his own eyes had seen come upon the former impious tyrants he himself likewise suffered, because he did not receive instruction nor learn wisdom from the chastisements of his neighbors, but followed the same path of impiety which they had trod, and was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> hurled over the same precipice. Thus he lay prostrate.</p>

<p>6. But Constantine, the mightiest victor, adorned with every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, together with his son Crispus, a most God-beloved prince, and in all respects like his father, recovered the East which belonged to them;  and they formed one united Roman empire as of old, bringing under their peaceful sway the whole world from the rising of the sun to the opposite quarter, both north and south, even to the extremities of the declining day.</p>

<p>7. All <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> therefore of those who had formerly afflicted them was taken away from men, and they celebrated splendid and festive days. Everything was filled with light, and those who before were downcast beheld each other with smiling faces and beaming eyes. With dances and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, in city and country, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> first of all God the universal King, because they had been thus taught, and then the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor with his God-beloved children.</p>

<p>8. There was oblivion of past <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and forgetfulness of every deed of impiety; there was enjoyment of present benefits and expectation of those yet to come. Edicts full of clemency and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> containing tokens of benevolence and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> were issued in every place by the victorious emperor. </p>

<p>9. Thus after all tyranny had been purged away, the empire which belonged to them was preserved firm and without a rival for Constantine and his sons alone.  And having obliterated the godlessness of their predecessors, recognizing the benefits conferred upon them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they exhibited their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and gratitude to the Deity, by the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which they performed in the sight of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>
