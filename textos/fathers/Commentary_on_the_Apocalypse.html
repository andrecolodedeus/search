<h1>Commentary on the Apocalypse</h1>

<h2>From the First Chapter</h2>

<p>1. <q>The Revelation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave to Him, and showed unto His servants things which must shortly come to pass, and signified it. Blessed are they who read and hear the words of this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and keep the things which are written.</q> The beginning of the book promises blessing to him that reads and hears and keeps, that he who takes pains about the reading may thence learn <span style="italic">to do</span> works, and may keep the precepts. </p>

<p>4. <q>Grace unto you, and peace, from Him which is, and which was, and which is to come.</q> <span style="italic">He is</span>, because He endures continually; <span style="italic">He was</span>, because with the Father He made all things, and has at this time taken a beginning from the Virgin; <span style="italic">He is to come</span>, because assuredly <span style="italic">He will come</span> to judgment. </p>

<p><q>And from the seven spirits which are before His throne.</q> We read of a sevenfold spirit in Isaiah, &mdash; namely, the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord. </p>

<p>5. <q>And from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who is the faithful <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, the first-begotten of the dead.</q> In taking upon Him manhood, He gave a testimony in the world, wherein also having suffered, He freed us by His blood from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and having vanquished <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, He was the first who rose from the dead, and <q>death shall have no more dominion over Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072243"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;6:9</a></span> but by His own reign the kingdom of the world is destroyed. </p>

<p>6. <q>And He made us a kingdom and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> unto God and His Father.</q> That is to say, a Church of all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>; as also the Apostle Peter says: <q>A <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, a royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072244"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:9</a></span> </p>

<p>7. <q>Behold, He shall come with clouds, and every eye shall see Him.</q> For He who at first came hidden in the manhood that He had undertaken, shall after a little while come to judgment manifest in majesty and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And what says He? </p>

<p>12. <q>And I turned, and saw seven golden candlesticks; and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</q> He says that He was like Him after His victory over death, when He had ascended into the heavens, after the union in His body of the power which He received from the Father with the spirit of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. </p>

<p>13. <q>As it were the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks.</q> He says, in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, as it is said in Solomon, <q>I will walk in the midst of the paths of the just,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072245"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse20">Proverbs&nbsp;8:20</a></span> whose antiquity is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and the fountain of majesty. </p>

<p><q>Clothed with a garment down to the ankles.</q> In the long, that is, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> garment, these words very plainly deliver the flesh which was not corrupted in death, and has the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> through suffering. </p>

<p><q>And He was girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</q> His paps are the two testaments, and the golden girdle is the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as gold tried in the fire. Otherwise the golden girdle bound around His breast indicates the enlightened <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and the pure and spiritual apprehension that is given to the churches. </p>

<p>14. <q>And His head and His hairs were white as it were white wool, and as it were snow.</q> On the head the whiteness is shown; <q>but the head of Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072246"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> In the white hairs is the multitude of abbots  like to wool, in respect of simple sheep; to snow, in respect of the innumerable crowd of candidates taught from heaven. </p>

<p><q>His eyes were as a flame of fire.</q> God's precepts are those which minister light to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, but to unbelievers burning. </p>

<p>16. <q>And in His face was brightness as the sun.</q> That which He called <span style="italic">brightness</span> was the appearance of that in which He spoke to men face to face. But the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <span style="italic">sun</span> is less than the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord. Doubtless on account of its rising and setting, and rising again, that He was born and suffered and rose again, therefore the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> gave this similitude, likening His face to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the sun. </p>

<p>15. <q>His feet were like yellow brass, as if burned in a furnace.</q> He calls the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> His feet, who, being wrought by suffering, preached His word in the whole world; for He rightly named those by whose means the preaching went forth, feet. Whence also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> anticipated this, and said: <q>We will worship in the place where His feet have stood.</q>  Because where they first of all stood and confirmed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that is, in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall assemble together, and will worship their Lord. </p>

<p>16. <q>And out of His mouth was issuing a sharp two-edged sword.</q> By the twice-sharpened sword going forth out of His mouth is shown, that it is He Himself who has both now declared the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and previously by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> declared the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the law to the whole world. But because from the same word, as well of the New as of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, He will assert Himself upon the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, therefore He is spoken of as two-edged. For the sword arms the soldier, the sword slays the enemy, the sword punishes the deserter. And that He might show to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> that He was announcing judgment, He says: <q>I came not to send peace, but a sword.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072249"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;10:34</a></span> And after He had completed His <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, He says to them: <q>Havey3ye understood all these things? And they said, We have. And He added, Therefore is every scribe instructed in the kingdom of God like a man that is a father of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, bringing forth from his treasure things new and old,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072250"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse51">Matthew&nbsp;13:51-52</a></span> &mdash; the new, the evangelical words of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; the old, the precepts of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: and He testified that these proceeded out of His mouth. Moreover, He also says to Peter: <q>Go to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that shall first come up; and having opened its mouth, you shall find a <span style="italic">stater</span> (that is, two <span style="italic">denarii</span>), and you shall give it for me and for you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072251"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;17:27</a></span> And similarly David says by the Spirit: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke once, twice I have heard the same.</q>  Because God once decreed from the beginning what shall be even to the end. Finally, as He Himself is the Judge appointed by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, on account of His assumption of humanity, wishing to show that men shall be judged by the word that He had declared, He says: <q>Do you think that I will judge you at the last day? Nay, but the word,</q> says He, <q>which I have spoken unto you, that shall judge you in the last day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072253"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse48">John&nbsp;12:48</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, speaking of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> to the Thessalonians, says: <q>Whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072254"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> And Isaiah says: <q>By the breath of His lips He shall slay the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072255"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;11:4</a></span> This, therefore, is the two-edged sword issuing out of His mouth. </p>

<p>15. <q>And His voice as it were the voice of many waters.</q> The many waters are understood to be many peoples, or the gift of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> that He sent forth by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, saying: <q>Go, teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072256"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> </p>

<p>16. <q>And He had in His right hand seven stars.</q> He said that in His right hand He had seven stars, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of sevenfold agency was given into His power by the Father. As Peter exclaimed to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: <q>Being at the right hand of God exalted, He has shed forth this Spirit received from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which you both see and hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072257"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse33">Acts&nbsp;2:33</a></span> Moreover, John the Baptist had also anticipated this, by saying to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>For God gives not the Spirit by measure <span style="italic">unto Him</span> . The Father,</q> says he, <q>loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and has given all things into His hands.</q>  Those seven stars are the seven churches, which he names in his addresses by name, and calls them to whom he wrote epistles. Not that they are themselves the only, or even the principal churches; but what he says to one, he says to all. For they are in no respect different, that on that ground any one should prefer them to the larger number of similar small ones. In the whole world <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> taught that all the churches are arranged by sevens, that they are called seven, and that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is one. And first of all, indeed, that he himself also might maintain the type of seven churches, he did not exceed that number. But he wrote to the Romans, to the Corinthians, to the Galatians, to the Ephesians, to the Thessalonians, to the Philippians, to the Colossians; afterwards he wrote to individual <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, so as not to exceed the number of seven churches. And abridging in a short space his announcement, he thus says to Timothy: <q>That you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how you ought to behave yourself in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the living God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072259"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:15</a></span> We read also that this typical number is announced by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by the month of Isaiah: <q>Of seven <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> which took hold of one man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072260"><a href="../bible/isa004.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;4:1</a></span> The one man is Christ, not born of seed; but the seven <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are seven churches, receiving His bread, and clothed with his apparel, who ask that their reproach should be taken away, only that His name should be called upon them. The bread is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which nourishes to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, promised to them, that is, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And His garments wherewith they desire to be clothed are the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle says: <q>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072261"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53</a></span> Moreover, they ask that their reproach may be taken away&mdash; that is, that they may be cleansed from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: for the reproach is the original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is taken away in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and they begin to be called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> men, which is, <q>Let your name be called upon us.</q> Therefore in these seven churches, of one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, because it is one in seven by the quality of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and election. Whether writing to them who labour in the world, and live  of the frugality of their labours, and are patient, and when they see certain men in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> wasters, and pernicious, they hear them, lest there should become dissension, he yet admonishes them by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that in what respects their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is deficient they should repent; or to those who dwell in cruel places among persecutors, that they should continue faithful; or to those who, under the pretext of mercy, do unlawful <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and make them manifest to be done by others; or to those that are at ease in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; or to those who are negligent, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> only in name; or to those who are meekly instructed, that they may bravely persevere in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; or to those who study the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and labour to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of their announcement, and are unwilling to do God's work that is mercy and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: to all he urges penitence, to all he declares judgment. </p>

<h2>From the Second Chapter</h2>

<p>2. <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your works, and your labour, and your patience.</q> In the first epistle He speaks thus: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you suffer and work, I see that you are patient; think not that I am staying long from you. </p>

<p><q>And that you can not bear them that are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and who say that they are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and are not, and you have found them liars, and you have patience for My name's sake.</q> All these things tend to praise, and that no small praise; and it behooves such men, and such a class, and such elected <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, by all means to be admonished, that they may not be defrauded of such privileges granted to them of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These few things He said that He had against them. </p>

<p>4, 5. <q>And you have left your first <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: remember whence you have fallen.</q> He who falls, falls from a height: therefore He said <span style="italic">whence</span>: because, even to the very last, works of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> must be practised; and this is the principal commandment. Finally, unless this is done, He threatened to remove their candlestick out of its place, that is, to disperse the congregation. </p>

<p>6. <q>This you have also, that you hate the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the Nicolaitanes.</q> But because you yourself hatest those who hold the doctrines of the Nicolaitanes, you expect praise. Moreover, to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the works of the Nicolaitanes, which He Himself also <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, this tends to praise. But the works of the Nicolaitanes were in that time false and troublesome men, who, as ministers under the name of Nicolaus, had made for themselves a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, to the effect that what had been offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> might be exorcised and eaten, and that whoever should have committed fornication might receive peace on the eighth day. Therefore He extols those to whom He is writing; and to these men, being such and so great, He promised the tree <span style="italic">of life</span>, which is in the paradise of His God. </p>

<p>The following epistle unfolds the mode of life and habit of another order which follows. He proceeds to say:&mdash; </p>

<p>9. <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your tribulation and your poverty, but you are rich.</q> For He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that with such men there are riches hidden with Him, and that they deny the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who say that they are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and are not; but they are the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, since they are gathered together by <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>; and to them He says:&mdash; </p>

<p>10. <q>Be faithful unto death.</q> That they should continue to be faithful even unto death. </p>

<p>11. <q>He that shall overcome, shall not be hurt by the second death.</q> That is, he shall not be chastised in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. </p>

<p>The third order of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shows that they are men who are strong in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and who are not afraid of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; but because even among them there are some who are inclined to unlawful associations, He says:&mdash; </p>

<p>14-16. <q>You have there some who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught in the case of Balak that he should put a stumbling-block before the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to eat and to commit fornication. So also have you them who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes; but I will fight with them with the sword of my mouth.</q> That is, I will say what I shall command, and I will tell you what you shall do. For Balaam,  with his doctrine, taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the eyes of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to eat what was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and to commit fornication&mdash;a thing which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have happened of old. For he gave this advice to the king of the Moabites, and they caused stumbling to the people. Thus, says He, you have among you those who hold such doctrine; and under the pretext of mercy, you would corrupt others. </p>

<p>17. <q>To him that overcomes I will give the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone.</q> The hidden manna is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; the white gem is adoption to <span style="italic">be</span> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>; the new name written on the stone is <q><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</q> </p>

<p>The fourth class intimates the nobility of the faithful, who labour daily, and do greater works. But even among them also He shows that there are men of an easy disposition to grant unlawful peace, and to listen to new forms of prophesying; and He reproves and warns the others to whom this is not pleasing, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> opposed to them: for which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> He purposes to bring upon the head of the faithful both sorrows and dangers; and therefore He says:&mdash; </p>

<p>24. <q>I will not put upon you any other burden.</q> That is, I have not given you <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, observances, and duties, which is another burden. </p>

<p>25, 26. <q>But that which you have, hold fast until I come; and he that overcomes, to him will I give power over all peoples.</q> That is, him I will appoint as judge among the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. </p>

<p>28. <q>And I will give him the morning star.</q> To wit, the first resurrection. He promised the morning star, which drives away the night, and announces the light, that is, the beginning of day. </p>

<h2>From the Third Chapter</h2>

<p>The fifth class, company, or association of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, sets forth men who are careless, and who are carrying on in the world other transactions than those which they ought&mdash; <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> only in name. And therefore He exhorts them that by any means they should be turned away from negligence, and be saved; and to this effect He says:&mdash; </p>

<p>2. <q>Be watchful, and strengthen the other things which were ready to die; for I have not found your works perfect before God.</q> For it is not enough for a tree to live and to have no fruit, even as it is not enough to be called a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and to confess Christ, but not to have Himself in our work, that is, not to do His precepts. </p>

<p>The sixth class is the mode of life of the best election. The habit of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is set forth; of those, to wit, who are lowly in the world, and unskilled in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and who hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> immoveably, and are not at all broken down by any chance, or withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Therefore He says to them:&mdash; </p>

<p>8. <q>I have set before you an open door, because you have kept the word of my patience.</q> In such little strength. </p>

<p>10. <q>And I will keep you from the hour of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> That they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to be of this kind, that they are not indeed permitted to be given over to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. </p>

<p>12. <q>He that overcomes shall be made a pillar in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For even as a pillar is an ornament of the building, so he who perseveres shall obtain a nobility in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. </p>

<p>Moreover, the seventh association of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> declares that they are rich men placed in positions of dignity, but believing that they are rich, among whom indeed the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are discussed in their bedchamber, while the faithful are outside; and they are understood by none, although they boast themselves, and say that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things&mdash;endowed with the confidence of learning, but ceasing from its labour. And thus He says:&mdash; </p>

<p>15. <q>That they are neither cold nor hot.</q> That is, neither unbelieving nor believing, for they are all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And because he who is neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm, gives nausea, He says:&mdash; </p>

<p>16. <q>I will vomit you out of My mouth.</q> Although nausea is hateful, still it hurts no one; so also is it with men of this kind when they have been cast forth. But because there is time of repentance, He says:&mdash; </p>

<p>18. <q>I persuade you to buy of Me gold tried in the fire.</q> That is, that in whatever manner you can, you should suffer for the Lord's name tribulations and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. </p>

<p><q>And anoint your eyes with eye-salve.</q> That what you gladly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, you should strive also to do the work of the same. And because, if in these ways men return out of great destruction to great repentance, they are not only useful to themselves, but they are able also to be of advantage to many, He promised them no small reward&mdash;to sit, namely, on the throne of judgment. </p>

<h2>From the Fourth Chapter</h2>

<p>1. <q>After this, I beheld, and, lo, a door was opened in heaven.</q> The new testament is announced as an open door in heaven. </p>

<p><q>And the first voice which I heard <span style="italic">was</span>, as it were, of a trumpet talking with me, saying, Come up hither.</q> Since the door is shown to be opened, it is manifest that previously it had been closed to men. And it was sufficiently and fully laid open when Christ ascended with His body to the Father into heaven. Moreover, the first voice which he had heard when he says that it spoke with him, without contradiction condemns those who say that one spoke in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, another in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; since it is rather He Himself who comes, that is the same who spoke in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For John was of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and all that people which had heard the announcement of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was edified with his word. </p>

<p><q>That very same voice,</q> said he, <q>that I had heard, that said unto me, Come up hither.</q> That is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, whom a little before he confesses that he had seen walking as the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> in the midst of the golden candlesticks. And he now gathers from Him what had been foretold in similitudes by the law, and associates with this scripture all the former <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and opens up the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. And because our Lord invited in His own name all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> into heaven, He immediately poured out the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who should bring them to heaven. He says:&mdash; </p>

<p>2. <q>Immediately I was in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</q> And since the mind of the faithful is opened by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and that is manifested to them which was also foretold to the fathers, he distinctly says:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>And, behold, a throne was set in heaven.</q> The throne set: what is it but the throne of judgment and of the King? </p>

<p>3. <q>And He that sat upon the throne was, to look upon, like a jasper and a sardine stone.</q> Upon the throne he says that he saw the likeness of a jasper and a sardine stone. The jasper is of the colour of water, the sardine of fire. These two are thence manifested to be placed as judgments upon God's tribunal until the consummation of the world, of which judgments one is already completed in the deluge of water, and the other shall be completed by fire. </p>

<p><q>And there was a rainbow about the throne.</q> Moreover, the rainbow round about the throne has the same colours. The rainbow is called a bow from what the Lord spoke to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and to his sons,  that they should not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> any further deluge in the generation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but fire. For thus He says: I will place my bow in the clouds, that you may now no longer <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> water, but fire. </p>

<p>6. <q>And before the throne there was, as it were, a sea of glass like to crystal.</q> That is the gift of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which He sheds forth through His Son in time of repentance, before He executes judgment. It is therefore before the throne, that is, the judgment. And when he says a sea of glass like to crystal, he shows that it is pure water, smooth, not agitated by the wind, not flowing down as on a slope, but given to be immoveable as the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p><q>And round about the throne were four living creatures.</q> The four living creatures are the four <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. </p>

<p>7-10. <q>The first living creature was like to a lion, and the second was like to a calf, and the third had a face like to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the fourth was like to a flying eagle; and they had six wings, and round about and within they were full of eyes; and they had no rest, saying, Holy, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, Lord Omnipotent. And the four and twenty elders, falling down before the throne, adored God.</q> The four and twenty elders are the twenty-four books of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and of the law, which give testimonies of the judgment. Moreover, also, they are the twenty-four fathers&mdash; twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and twelve patriarchs. And in that the living creatures are different in appearance, this is the reason: the living creature like to a lion designates Mark, in whom is heard the voice of the lion roaring in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. And in the figure of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, Matthew strives to declare to us the genealogy of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, from whom Christ took flesh. Therefore, in enumerating from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to David, and thence to Joseph, he spoke of Him as if of a man: therefore his announcement sets forth the image of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Luke, in narrating the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of Zacharias as he offers a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for the people, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> that appears to him with respect of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and the victim in the same description bore the likeness of a calf. John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, like to an eagle hastening on uplifted wings to greater heights, argues about the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. Mark, therefore, as an <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> thus beginning, <q>The beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as it is written in Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>;</q>  The voice of one crying in the wilderness, <span class="stiki" id="note072266"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;40:3</a></span> &mdash; has the effigy of a lion. And Matthew, <q>The book of the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the son of David, the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072267"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;1:1</a></span> this is the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But Luke said, <q>There was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, by name Zachariah, of the course of Abia, and his wife was of the daughters of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072268"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;1:5</a></span> this is the likeness of a calf. But John, when he begins, <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  sets forth the likeness of a flying eagle. Moreover, not only do the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> express their four similitudes in their <span style="italic">respective</span> openings of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, but also the Word itself of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Omnipotent, which is His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, bears the same likeness in the time of His advent. When He preaches to us, He is, as it were, a lion and a lion's cub. And when for man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> He was made man to overcome death, and to set all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> free, and that He offered Himself a victim to the Father on our behalf, He was called a calf. And that He overcame death and ascended into the heavens, extending His wings and protecting His people, He was named a flying eagle. Therefore these announcements, although they are four, yet are one, because it proceeded from one mouth. Even as the river in paradise, although it is one, was divided into four heads. Moreover, that for the announcement of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> those living creatures had eyes within and without, shows the spiritual <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> which both looks into the secrets of the heart, and beholds the things which are coming after that are within and without. </p>

<p>8. <q>Six wings.</q> These are the testimonies of the books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Thus, twenty and four make as many as there are elders sitting upon the thrones. But as an animal cannot fly unless it have wings, so, too, the announcement of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> gains no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unless it have the fore-announced testimonies of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, by which it is lifted from the earth, and flies. For in every case, what has been told before, and is afterwards found to have happened, that begets an undoubting <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Again, also, if wings be not attached to the living creatures, they have nothing whence they may draw their life. For unless what the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold had been consummated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, their preaching was vain. For the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> holds those things which were both before predicted and afterwards accomplished. And it flies, because the living animal is reasonably lifted up from the earth. But to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who do not avail themselves of the prophetic testimony, to them also there are present living creatures; but they do not fly, because they are of the earth. And to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who do <span style="italic">not</span> receive the announcement of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> there are present wings; but they do not fly, that is, they bring a vain prophesying to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not adjusting facts to their words. And the books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> that are received are twenty-four, which you will find in the epitomes of Theodore. But, moreover (as we have said), four and twenty elders, patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, are to judge His people. For to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, when they asked, saying, <q>We have forsaken all that we had, and followed You: what shall we have?</q> our Lord replied, <q>When the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall sit upon the throne of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072270"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;19:27-28</a></span> But of the fathers also who should judge, says the patriarch Jacob, <q>Dan also himself shall judge his people among his brethren, even as one of the tribes in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072271"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;49:16</a></span> </p>

<p>5. <q>And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and seven torches of fire burning.</q> And the lightnings, and voices, and thunders proceeding from the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the seven torches of fire burning, signify announcements, and promises of adoption, and threatenings. For lightnings signify the Lord's advent, and the voices the announcements of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and the thunders, that the words are from heaven. The burning torches of fire <span style="italic">signify</span> the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that it is given by the wood of the passion. And when these things were doing, he says that all the elders fell down and adored the Lord; while the living creatures&mdash; that is, of course, the actions recorded in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and the teaching of the Lord&mdash; gave Him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.  In that they had fulfilled the word that had been previously foretold by them, they worthily and with reason exult, feeling that they have ministered the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and the word of the Lord. Finally, also, because He had come who should remove death, and who alone was worthy to take the crown of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, all for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His most excellent doing had crowns. </p>

<p>10. <q>And they cast their crowns under His feet.</q> That is, on account of the eminent <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> victory, they cast all their victories under His feet. This is what in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> consummated by showing, For when about finally to suffer, our Lord had come to Jerusalem, and the people had gone forth to meet Him, some strewed the road with palm branches cut down, others threw down their garments, doubtless these were setting forth two peoples&mdash; the one of the patriarchs, the other of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; that is to say, of the great men who had any kind of palms of their victories against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and cast them under the feet of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the victor of all. And the palm and the crown signify the same things, and these are not given save to the victor. </p>

<h2>From the Fifth Chapter</h2>

<p>1. <q>And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne, a book written within and without, sealed with seven seals.</q> This book signifies the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which has been given into the hands of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who received from the Father judgment. </p>

<p>2, 3. <q>And I saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> full of strength proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? And no one was found worthy, neither in the earth nor under the earth, to open the book.</q> Now to open the book is to overcome death for man. </p>

<p>4. <q>There was none found worthy to do this.</q> Neither among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of heaven, nor among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in earth, nor among the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in rest, save Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> alone, whom he says that he saw as a Lamb standing as it were slain, having seven horns. What had not been then announced, and what the law had contemplated for Him by its various oblations and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, it behooved Himself to fulfil. And because He Himself was the testator, who had overcome death, it was just that Himself should be appointed the Lord's heir, that He should possess the substance of the dying man, that is, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> members. </p>

<p>5. <q>Lo, the Lion of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, the root of David, has prevailed.</q> We read in Genesis that this lion of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a> has conquered, when the patriarch Jacob says, <q>Judah, your brethren shall praise you; you have lain down and slept, and have risen up again as a lion, and as a lion's cub.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072273"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;49:8-9</a></span> For He is called a lion for the overcoming of death; but for the suffering for men He was led as a lamb to the slaughter. But because He overcame death, and anticipated the duty of the executioner, He was called as it were slain. He therefore opens and seals again the testament, which He Himself had sealed. The legislator <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> intimating this, that it behooved Him to be sealed and concealed, even to the advent of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, veiled his face, and so spoke to the people; showing that the words of his announcement were veiled even to the advent of His time. For he himself, when he had read to the people, having taken the wool purpled with the blood of the calf, with water sprinkled the whole people, saying, <q>This is the blood of His testament who has purified you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072274"><a href="../bible/exo024.htm#verse7">Exodus&nbsp;24:7-8</a></span> It should therefore be observed that the Man is accurately announced, and that all things combine into one. For it is not sufficient that that law is spoken of, but it is named as a testament. For no law is called a testament, nor is any thing else called a testament, save what <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> make who are about to die. And whatever is within the testament is sealed, even to the day of the testator's death. Therefore it is with reason that it is only sealed by the Lamb slain, who, as it were a lion, has broken death in pieces, and has fulfilled what had been foretold; and has delivered man, that is, the flesh, from death, and has received as a possession the substance of the dying person, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> members; that as by one body all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> had fallen under the obligation of its death, also by one body all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> should be born again unto life, and rise again. Reasonably, therefore, His face is opened and unveiled to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; and therefore He is called Apocalypse, Revelation. For now His book is unsealed&mdash; now the offered victims are perceived&mdash; now the fabrication of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> chrism; moreover the testimonies are openly understood. </p>

<p>8, 9. <q>Twenty-four elders and four living creatures, having harps and phials, and singing a new song.</q> The proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> associated with the New, points out the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people singing a new song, that is, bearing their confession publicly. It is a new thing that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> should become man. It is a new thing to ascend into the heavens with a body. It is a new thing to give remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to men. It is a new thing for men to be sealed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. It is a new thing to receive the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of sacred observance, and to look for a kingdom of unbounded promise. The harp, and the chord stretched on its wooden frame, signifies the flesh of Christ linked with the wood of the passion. The phial signifies <span style="italic">the</span> Confession,  and the race of the new Priesthood. But it is the praise of many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, yea, of all, the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all, and the testimony of the universal creation, bringing to our Lord thanksgiving for the deliverance of men from the destruction of death. The unsealing of the seals, as we have said, is the opening of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and the foretelling of the preachers of things to come in the last times, which, although the prophetic Scripture speaks by single seals, yet by all the seals opened at once, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> takes its rank. </p>

<h2>From the Sixth Chapter</h2>

<p>1, 2. <q>And when the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals, I saw, and heard one of the four living creatures saying, Come and see. And, lo, a white horse, and He who sat upon him had a bow.</q> The first seal being opened, he says that he saw a white horse, and a crowned horseman having a bow. For this was at first done by Himself. For after the Lord ascended into heaven and opened all things, He sent the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whose words the preachers sent forth as arrows reaching to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart, that they might overcome unbelief. And the crown on the head is promised to the preachers by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. The other three horses very plainly signify the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, famines, and pestilences announced by our Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. And thus he says that one of the four living creatures said (because all four are one), <q>Come and see.</q> <q>Come</q> is said to him that is invited to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <q>see</q> is said to him who saw not. Therefore the white horse is the word of preaching with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> sent into the world. For the Lord says, <q>This <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> shall be preached throughout the whole world for a testimony to all nations, and then shall come the end.</q>  </p>

<p>3, 4. <q>And when He had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red, and to him that sat upon him was given a great sword.</q> The red horse, and he that sat upon him, having a sword, signify the coming <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, as we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be great earthquakes in <span style="italic">various</span> places.</q>  This is the ruddy horse. </p>

<p>5. <q>And when He had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come and see. And, lo, a black horse; and he who sat upon it had a balance in his hand.</q> The black horse signifies famine, for the Lord says, <q>There shall be famines in <span style="italic">various</span> places;</q> but the word is specially extended to the times of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, when there shall be a great famine, and when all shall be injured. Moreover, the balance in the hand is the examining scales, wherein He might show forth the merits of every individual. He then says:&mdash; </p>

<p>6. <q>Hurt not the wine and the oil.</q> That is, strike not the spiritual man with your inflictions. This is the black horse. </p>

<p>7, 8. <q>And when He had opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying, Come and see. And, lo, a pale horse; and he who sat upon him was named Death.</q> For the pale horse and he who sat upon him bore the name of Death. These same things also the Lord had promised among the rest of the coming destructions&mdash; great pestilences and deaths; since, moreover, he says:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>And <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> followed him.</q> That is, it was waiting for the devouring of many unrighteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. This is the pale horse. </p>

<p>9. <q>And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of them that were slain.</q> He relates that he saw under the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, under the earth, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of them that were slain. For both heaven and earth are called God's altar, as says the law, commanding in the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> form of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> two altars to be made&mdash;a golden one within, and a brazen one without. But we perceive that the golden altar is thus called heaven, by the testimony that our Lord bears to it; for He says, <q>When you bring your gift to the altar</q> (assuredly our gifts are the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which we offer), <q>and there rememberest that your brother has ought against you, leave there your gift before the altar.</q>  Assuredly <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> ascend to heaven. Therefore heaven is understood to be the golden altar which was within; for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> also were accustomed to enter once in the year&mdash; as they who had the anointing&mdash; to the golden altar, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> signifying that Christ should do this once for all. As the golden altar is acknowledged to be heaven, so also by the brazen altar is understood the earth, under which is the Hades,&mdash; a region withdrawn from punishments and fires, and a place of repose for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, wherein indeed the righteous are seen and heard by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but they cannot be carried across to them. He who sees all things would have us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, therefore&mdash; that is, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the slain&mdash; are asking for vengeance for their blood, that is, of their body, from those that dwell upon the earth; but because in the last time, moreover, the reward of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be perpetual, and the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall come, it was told them to wait. And for a solace to their body, there were given unto each of them white robes. They received, says he, white robes, that is, the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. </p>

<p>12. <q>And I saw, when he had opened the sixth seal, there was a great earthquake.</q> In the sixth seal, then, was a great earthquake: this is that very last <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. </p>

<p><q>And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair.</q> The sun becomes as sackcloth; that is, the brightness of doctrine will be obscured by unbelievers. </p>

<p><q>And the entire moon became as blood.</q> By the moon of blood is set forth the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as pouring out her blood for Christ. </p>

<p>13. <q>And the stars fell to the earth.</q> The falling of the stars are the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who are troubled for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake. </p>

<p><q>Even as a fig-tree casts her untimely figs.</q> The fig-tree, when shaken, loses its untimely figs&mdash; when men are separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. </p>

<p>14. <q>And the heaven withdrew as a scroll that is rolled up.</q> For the heaven to be rolled away, that is, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shall be taken away. </p>

<p><q>And every mountain and the islands were moved from their places.</q> Mountains and islands removed from their places intimate that in the last <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> departed from their places; that is, that the good will be removed, seeking to avoid the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. </p>

<h2>From the Seventh Chapter</h2>

<p>2. <q>And I saw another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God.</q> He speaks of Elias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who is the precursor of the times of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, for the restoration and establishment of the churches from the great and intolerable <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. We read that these things are predicted in the opening of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; for He says by Malachi: <q>Lo, I will send to you Elias the Tishbite, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, according to the time of calling, to recall the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the people that succeed them.</q>  And to that end He shows, as we have said, that the number of those that shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, is a great multitude which no man was able to number. Moreover, we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are sent from heaven by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and that they are received against <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and that the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> is cast out and extinguished by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for He says: <q>Pray that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>: for there shall be a great affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of the world; and except the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072280"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse18">Mark&nbsp;13:18-20</a></span> Therefore He shall send these seven great archangels to smite the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>; for He Himself also thus said: <q>Then the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall send His messengers; and they shall gather together His elect from the four corners of the wind, from the one end of heaven even to the other end thereof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072281"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse27">Mark&nbsp;13:27</a></span> For, moreover, He previously says by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Then shall there be peace for our land, when there shall arise in it seven shepherds and eight attacks of men; and they shall encircle Assur,</q> that is, <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, <q>in the trench of Nimrod,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072282"><a href="../bible/mic005.htm#verse5">Micah&nbsp;5:5-6</a></span> that is, in the nation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, by the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Similarly when the keepers of the house shall be moved. Moreover, the Lord Himself, in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, when the labourers had come to Him and said, <q>Lord, did not we sow good seed in Your field? Whence, then, has it tares? Answered them, An enemy has done this. And they said to Him, Lord, will You, then, that we go and root them up? And He said, Nay, but let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, that they gather the tares and make bundles of them, and burn them with <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">fire everlasting</a>, but that they gather the wheat into my barns.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072283"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;13:27-30</a></span> The Apocalypse here shows, therefore, that these reapers, and shepherds, and labourers, are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And the trumpet is the word of power. And although the same thing recurs in the phials, still it is not said as if it occurred twice, but because what is decreed by the Lord to happen shall be once for all; for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it is said twice. What, therefore, He said too little in the trumpets, is here found in the phials. We must not regard the order of what is said, because frequently the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, when He has traversed even to the end of the last times, returns again to the same times, and fills up what He had <span style="italic">before</span> failed to say.  Nor must we look for order in the Apocalypse; but we must follow the meaning of those things which are prophesied. Therefore in the trumpets and phials is signified either the desolation of the plagues that are sent upon the earth, or the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> himself, or the cutting off of the peoples, or the diversity of the plagues, or the hope in the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, or the ruin of states, or the great overthrow of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, that is, the Roman state. </p>

<p>9. <q>After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man was able to number, of every nation, tribe, and people, and tongue, clothed with white robes.</q> What the great multitude out of every tribe implies, is to show the number of the elect out of all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, who, being cleansed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the blood of the Lamb, have made their robes white, keeping the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which they have received. </p>

<h2>From the Eighth Chapter</h2>

<p>1. <q>And when He had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.</q> Whereby is signified the beginning of everlasting rest; but it is described as partial, because the silence being interrupted, he repeats it in order. For if the silence had continued, here would be an end of his narrative. </p>

<p>13. <q>And I saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> flying through the midst of heaven.</q> By the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> flying through the midst of heaven is signified the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in two of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that a great <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of plagues was imminent. If by any means, even in the last times, any one should be willing to be converted, any one might even still be saved. </p>

<h2>From the Ninth Chapter</h2>

<p>13, 14. <q>And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying to the sixth <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> which had the trumpet, Loose the four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> That is, the four corners of the earth which hold the four winds. </p>

<p><q>Which are bound in the great river Euphrates.</q> By the corners of the earth, or the four winds across the river Euphrates, are <span style="italic">meant</span> four nations, because to every nation is sent an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; as said the law, <q>He determined them by the number of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  until the number of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> should be filled up. They do not overpass their bounds, because at the last they shall come with <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>From the Tenth Chapter</h2>

<p>1, 2. <q>I saw another mighty <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: and he had in his hand an open book: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth.</q> He signifies that that mighty <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who, he says, descended from heaven, clothed with a cloud, is our Lord, as we have above narrated. </p>

<p><q>His face was as it were the sun.</q> That is, with respect to the resurrection. </p>

<p><q>Upon his head was a rainbow.</q> He points to the judgment which is executed by Him, or shall be. </p>

<p><q>An open book.</q> A revelation of works in the future judgment, or the Apocalypse which John received. </p>

<p><q>His feet,</q> as we have said above, are the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For that both things in sea and land are trodden under foot by Him, signifies that all things are placed under His feet. Moreover, he calls Him an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, that is, a messenger, to wit, of the Father; for He is called the Messenger of great counsel. He says also that He cried with a loud voice. The great voice is to tell the words of the Omnipotent God of heaven to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that after penitence is closed there will be no hope subsequently. </p>

<p>3. <q>Seven thunders uttered their voices.</q> The seven thunders uttering their voices signify the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of sevenfold power, who through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> announced all things to come, and by His voice John gave his testimony in the world; but because he says that he was about to write the things which the thunders had uttered, that is, whatever things had been obscure in the announcements of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; he is forbidden to write them, but he was charged to leave them sealed, because he is an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, nor was it fitting that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the subsequent stage should be given in the first. <q>The time,</q> says he, <q>is at hand.</q>  For the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, by powers, by signs, by portents, and by mighty works, have overcome unbelief. After them there is now given to the same completed Churches the comfort of having the prophetic Scriptures subsequently interpreted, for I said that after <span style="italic">the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a></span> there would be interpreting <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. </p>

<p>For the apostle says: <q>And he placed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> indeed, first, <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; secondly, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; thirdly, teachers,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072287"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:28</a></span> and the rest. And in another place he says: <q>Let the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> speak two or three, and let the others judge.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072288"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:29</a></span> And he says: <q>Every <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> or prophesies with her head uncovered, dishonours her head.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072289"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:5</a></span> And when he says, <q>Let the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> speak two or three, and let the others judge,</q> he is not speaking in respect of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of things unheard and unknown, but of things both announced and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But let them judge whether or not the interpretation is consistent with the testimonies of the prophetic utterance.  It is plain, therefore, that to John, armed as he was with superior <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, this was not necessary, although the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, adorned with His members, ought to respond to its position. </p>

<p>10. <q>I took the book from the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and ate it up.</q> To take the book and eat it up, is, when exhibition of a thing is made to one, to commit it to memory. </p>

<p><q>And it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.</q> To be sweet in the mouth is the reward of the preaching of the speaker, and is most pleasant to the hearers; but it is most bitter both to those that announce it, and to those that persevere in its commandments through suffering. </p>

<p>11. <q>And He says unto me, You must again prophesy to the peoples, and to the tongues, and to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and to many kings.</q> He says this, because when John said these things he was in the island of <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a>, condemned to the labour of the mines by C&aelig;sar <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>. There, therefore, he saw the Apocalypse; and when grown old, he thought that he should at length receive his quittance by suffering, <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> being killed, all his judgments were discharged. And John being dismissed from the mines, thus subsequently delivered the same Apocalypse which he had received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This, therefore, is what He says: You must again prophesy to all nations, because you see the crowds of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> rise up; and against them other crowds shall stand, and they shall fall by the sword on the one side and on the other. </p>

<h2>From the Eleventh Chapter</h2>

<p>1. <q>And there was shown unto me a reed like a rod: and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the altar, and them that worship therein.</q> A reed was shown like to a rod. This itself is the Apocalypse which he subsequently exhibited to the churches; for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the complete <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he subsequently wrote for the sake of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For when <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, and Ebion, and others of the school of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, were scattered abroad throughout the world, there assembled together to him from the neighbouring provinces all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and compelled him himself also to draw up his testimony. Moreover, we say that the measure of God's temple is the command of God to confess the Father Almighty, and that His Son Christ was begotten by the Father before the beginning of the world, and was made man in very <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh, both of them having overcome misery and death; and that, when received with His body into heaven by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He shed forth the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the gift and pledge of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, that He was announced by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, He was described by the law, He was God's hand, and the Word of the Father from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Lord over all, and founder of the world: this is the reed and the measure of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and no one worships the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar save he who confesses this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. </p>

<p>2. <q>The court which is within the temple leave out.</q> The space which is called the court is the empty altar within the walls: these being such as were not necessary, he commanded to be ejected from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. </p>

<p><q>It is given to be trodden down by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> That is, to the men of this world, that it may be trodden under foot by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, or with the nations. Then he repeats about the destruction and slaughter of the last time, and says:&mdash; </p>

<p>3. <q>They shall tread the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city down for forty and two months; and I will give to my two witnesses, and they shall predict a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth.</q> That is, three years and six months: these make forty-two months. Therefore their preaching is three years and six months, and the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> as much again. </p>

<p>5. <q>If any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies.</q> That fire proceeds out of the mouth of those <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> against the adversaries, bespeaks the power of the world. For all afflictions, however many there are, shall be sent by their messengers in their word. Many think that there is Elisha, or <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, with Elijah; but both of these died; while the death of Elijah is not heard of, with whom all our ancients have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that it was Jeremiah. For even the very word spoken to him testifies to him, saying, <q>Before I formed you in the belly I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you; and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you, and I ordained you a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> unto the nations.</q>  But he was not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> unto the nations; and thus the truthful word of God makes it necessary, which it has promised to set forth, that he should be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to the nations. </p>

<p>4. <q>These are the two candlesticks standing before the Lord of the earth.</q> These two candlesticks and two olive trees He has to this end spoken of, and admonished you that if, when you have read of them elsewhere, you have not understood, you may understand here. For in Zechariah, one of the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, it is thus written: <q>These are the two olive trees and two candlesticks which stand in the presence of the Lord of the earth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072292"><a href="../bible/zec004.htm#verse14">Zechariah&nbsp;4:14</a></span> that is, they are in paradise. Also, in another sense, standing in the presence of the lord of the earth, that is, in the presence of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. Therefore they must be slain by <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. </p>

<p>7. <q>And the beast which ascends from the abyss.</q> After many plagues completed in the world, in the end he says that a beast ascended from the abyss. But that he shall ascend from the abyss is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by many testimonies; for he says in the thirty-first chapter of Ezekiel: <q>Behold, Assur was a cypress in Mount Lebanon.</q> Assur, deeply rooted, was a lofty and branching cypress&mdash; that is, a numerous people&mdash; in Mount Lebanon, in the kingdom of kingdoms, that is, of the Romans. Moreover, that he says he was beautiful in offshoots, he says he was strong in armies. The water, he says, shall nourish him, that is, the many thousands of men which were subjected to him; and the abyss increased him, that is, belched him forth. For even Isaiah speaks almost in the same words; moreover, that he was in the kingdom of the Romans, and that he was among the C&aelig;sars. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> also bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, for he says to the Thessalonians: <q>Let him who now restrains restrain, until he be taken out of the way; and then shall appear that Wicked One, even he whose coming is after the working of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, with signs and lying wonders.</q>  And that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he should come who then was the prince, he added: <q>He already endeavours after the secret of mischief</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072294"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:10</a></span> &mdash; that is, the mischief which he is about to do he strives to do secretly; but he is not raised up by his own power, nor by that of his father, but by command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of which thing <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says in the same passage: <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, because they have not received the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He will send upon them a spirit of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, that they all may be persuaded of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, who have not been persuaded of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072295"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> And Isaiah says: <q>While they waited for the light, darkness arose upon them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072296"><a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;59:9</a></span> Therefore the Apocalypse sets forth that these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are killed by the same, and on the fourth day rise again, that none might be found equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p>8. <q>And their dead bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city, which spiritually is called <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q> But He calls Jerusalem <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, since it had become the heaping up of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> people. Therefore it behooves us diligently, and with the utmost care, to follow the prophetic announcement, and to understand what the Spirit from the Father both announces and anticipates, and how, when He has gone forward to the last times, He again repeats the former ones. And now, what He will do once for all, He sometimes sets forth as if it were done; and unless you understand this, as sometimes done, and sometimes as about to be done, you will fall into a great confusion. Therefore the interpretation of the following sayings has shown therein, that not the order of the reading, but the order of the discourse, must be understood. </p>

<p>19. <q>And the temple of God was opened which is in heaven.</q> The temple opened is a manifestation of our Lord. For the temple of God is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as He Himself says: <q>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</q> And when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said, <q>Forty and six years was this temple in building,</q> the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says, <q>He spoke of the temple of His body.</q>  </p>

<p><q>And there was seen in His temple the ark of the Lord's testament.</q> The preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and all the gifts whatever that came with Him, he says, appeared therein. </p>

<h2>From the Twelfth Chapter</h2>

<p>1. <q>And there was seen a great sign in heaven. A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. And being with child, she cried out travailing, and bearing torments that she might bring forth.</q> The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> clothed with the sun, and having the moon under her feet, and wearing a crown of twelve stars upon her head, and travailing in her pains, is the ancient Church of fathers, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  which had the groans and torments of its longing until it saw that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the fruit of its people according to the flesh long promised to it, had taken flesh out of the selfsame people. Moreover, being clothed with the sun intimates the hope of resurrection and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the promise. And the moon intimates the fall of the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> under the obligation of death, which never can fail. For even as life is diminished, so also it is increased. Nor is the hope of those that sleep extinguished absolutely, as some think, but they have in their darkness a light such as the moon. And the crown of twelve stars signifies the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of fathers, according to the fleshly birth, of whom Christ was to take flesh. </p>

<p>3. <q>And there appeared another sign in heaven; and behold a red dragon, having seven heads.</q> Now, that he says that this dragon was of a red colour&mdash; that is, of a purple colour&mdash; the result of his work gave him such a colour. For from the beginning (as the Lord says) he was a murderer; and he has oppressed the whole of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, not so much by the obligation of death, as, moreover, by the various forms of destruction and fatal mischiefs. His seven heads were the seven kings of the Romans, of whom also is <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, as we have said above. </p>

<p><q>And ten horns.</q> He says that the ten kings in the latest times are the same as these, as we shall more fully set forth there. </p>

<p>4. <q>And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them upon the earth.</q> Now, that he says that the dragon's tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, this may be taken in two ways. For many think that he may be able to seduce the third part of the men who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.  But it should more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> be understood, that of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that were subject to him, since he was still a prince when he descended from his estate, he seduced the third part; therefore what we said above, the Apocalypse says. </p>

<p><q>And the dragon stood before the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was beginning to bring forth, that, when she had brought forth, he might devour her child.</q> The red dragon standing and desiring to devour her child when she had brought him forth, is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>&mdash;to wit, the traitor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who thought that the perishing of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> would be alike by death; but He, who was not born of seed, owed nothing to death: wherefore he could not devour Him&mdash; that is, detain Him in death&mdash; for on the third day He rose again. Finally, also, and before He suffered, he approached to tempt Him as man; but when he found that He was not what he thought Him to be, he departed from Him, even till the time. Whence it is here said:&mdash; </p>

<p>5. <q>And she brought forth a son, who begins to rule all nations with a rod of iron.</q> The rod of iron is the sword of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. </p>

<p><q>I saw that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> withdrew from his abodes.</q> That is, the good will be removed, flying from <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.  </p>

<p><q>And her son was caught up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to His throne.</q> We read also in the Acts of the Apostles that He was caught up to God's throne, just as speaking with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> He was caught up to heaven. </p>

<p>6. <q>But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> fled into the wilderness, and there were given to her two great eagle's wings.</q> The aid of the great eagle's wings&mdash; to wit, the gift of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; was given to that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whence in the last times a hundred and forty-four thousands of men should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the preaching of Elias; but, moreover, he here says that the rest of the people should be found alive on the coming of the Lord. And the Lord says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Then let them which are in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> flee to the mountains;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072301"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;21:21</a></span> that is, as many as should be gathered together in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, let them go to that place which they have ready, and let them be supported there for three years and six months from the presence of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. </p>

<p>14. <q>Two great wings</q> are the two <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; Elias, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who shall be with him. </p>

<p>15. <q>And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> water as a flood, that he might carry her away with the flood.</q> He signifies by the water which the serpent cast out of his mouth, the people who at his command would <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> her. </p>

<p>16. <q>And the earth helped the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</q> That the earth opened her month and swallowed up the waters, sets forth the vengeance for the present troubles. Although, therefore, it may signify this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> bringing forth, it shows her afterwards flying when her offspring is brought forth, because both things did not happen at one time; for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Christ was born, but that the time should arrive that she should flee from the face of the serpent: (we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>) that this has happened as yet. Then he says:&mdash; </p>

<p>7-9. <q>There was a battle in heaven: Michael and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> fought with the dragon; and the dragon warred, and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and they prevailed not; nor was their place found any more in heaven. And that great dragon was cast forth, that old serpent: he was cast forth into the earth.</q> This is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>; yet previously Elias must prophesy, and there must be times of peace. And afterwards, when the three years and six months are completed in the preaching of Elias, he also must be cast down from heaven, where up till that time he had had the power of ascending; and all the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, must be roused up from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle says: <q>Except there come a falling away first, and the man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall appear, the son of perdition; and the adversary who exalted himself above all which is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or which is worshipped.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072302"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:3-4</a></span> </p>

<h2>From the Thirteenth chapter.</h2> 

<p>1. <q>And I saw a beast rising up from the sea, like a leopard.</q> This signifies the kingdom of that time of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, and the people mingled with the variety of nations. </p>

<p>2. <q>His feet were as the feet of a bear.</q> A strong and most unclean beast, the feet are to be understood as his leaders. </p>

<p><q>And his mouth as the mouth of a lion.</q> That is, his mouth armed for blood is his bidding, and a tongue which will proceed to nothing else than to the shedding of blood. </p>

<p>* * * * * * * * </p>

<p>18. <q>His number is the name of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.</q> As they have it reckoned from the Greek characters, they thus find it among many to be <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>, for <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span> has this number, which the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> call Sol and Ph&oelig;bus; and it is reckoned in Greek thus: <span class="greek">&#x03C4;</span> three hundred, <span class="greek">&#x03B5;</span> five, <span class="greek">&#x03B9;</span> ten, <span class="greek">&#x03C4;</span> three hundred, <span class="greek">&#x03B1;</span> one, <span class="greek">&#x03BD;</span> fifty&mdash;which taken together become six hundred and sixty-six. For as far as belongs to the Greek letters, they fill up this number and name; which name if you wish to turn into Latin, it is understood by the antiphrase DICLUX, which letters are reckoned in this manner: since D figures five hundred, I one, C a hundred, L fifty, V five, X ten&mdash;which by the reckoning up of the letters makes similarly six hundred and sixty-six, that is, what in Greek gives <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>, to wit, what in Latin is called DICLUX; by which name, expressed by antiphrases, we understand <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, who, although he be cut off from the supernal light, and deprived thereof, yet transforms himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light, daring to call himself light.  Moreover, we find in a certain Greek codex <span class="greek">&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, which letters being reckoned up, you will find to give the number as above: <span class="greek">&#x03B1;</span> one, <span class="greek">&#x03BD;</span> fifty, <span class="greek">&#x03C4;</span> three hundred, <span class="greek">&#x03B5;</span> five, <span class="greek">&#x03BC;</span> forty, <span class="greek">&#x03BF;</span> seventy, <span class="greek">&#x03C2;</span> two hundred&mdash;which together makes six hundred and sixty-six, according to the Greeks. Moreover, there is another name in Gothic of him, which will be evident of itself, that is, <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03C3;&#x1F75;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, which in the same way you will reckon in Greek letters: <span class="greek">&#x03B3;</span> three, <span class="greek">&#x03B5;</span> five, <span class="greek">&#x03BD;</span> fifty, <span class="greek">&#x03C3;</span> two hundred, <span class="greek">&#x03B7;</span> eight, <span class="greek">&#x03C1;</span> a hundred, <span class="greek">&#x03B9;</span> ten, <span class="greek">&#x03BA;</span> twenty, <span class="greek">&#x03BF;</span> seventy, <span class="greek">&#x03C2;</span> also two hundred, which, as has been said above, make six hundred and sixty-six. </p>

<p>11. <q>And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth.</q> He is speaking of the great and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a> who is to do signs, and portents, and falsehoods before him in the presence of men. </p>

<p><q>And he had two horns like a lamb&mdash; that is, the appearance within of a man&mdash; and he spoke like a dragon.</q> But the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> speaks full of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>; for he shall do these things in the presence of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so that even the dead appear to rise again.  </p>

<p>13. <q>And he shall make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men.</q> Yes (as I also have said), in the sight of men. Magicians do these things, by the aid of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, even to this day. He shall <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also that a golden image of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> shall be placed in the temple at Jerusalem, and that the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> should enter, and thence utter voices and oracles. Moreover, he himself shall contrive that his servants and children should receive as a mark on their foreheads, or on their right hands, the number of his name, lest any one should buy or sell them. Daniel had previously predicted his contempt and provocation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>And he shall place,</q> says he, <q>his temple within <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, upon the illustrious and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain that is at Jerusalem, an image such as <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> had made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072305"><a href="../bible/dan011.htm#verse45">Daniel&nbsp;11:45</a></span> Thence here he places, and by and by here he renews, that of which the Lord, admonishing His churches concerning the last times and their dangers, says: <q>But when you shall see the contempt which is spoken of by Daniel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> standing in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, let him who reads understand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072306"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;24:15</a>; <a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse27">Daniel&nbsp;9:27</a></span> It is called a contempt when God is provoked, because <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> are worshipped instead of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or when the dogma of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is introduced in the churches. But it is a turning away because steadfast men, seduced by false signs and portents, are turned away from their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. </p>

<h2>From the Fourteenth Chapter</h2>

<p>6. <q>And I saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> flying through the midst of heaven.</q> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> flying through the midst of heaven, whom he says that he saw, we have already treated of above, as being the same Elias who anticipates the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> in his <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. </p>

<p>8. <q>And another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> following him.</q> The other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> following, he speaks of as the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who is the associate of his prophesying. But that he says&mdash;</p>

<p>15. <q>Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather in the grapes of the vine,</q> he signifies it of the nations that should perish on the advent of the Lord. And indeed in many forms he shows this same thing, as if to the dry harvest, and the seed for the coming of the Lord, and the consummation of the world, and the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the future appearance of the kingdom of the blessed. </p>

<p>19, 20. <q>And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> thrust in the sickle, and reaped the vine of the earth, and cast it into the wine-press of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the wine-press of His fury was trodden down without the city.</q> In that he says that it was cast into the wine-press of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and trodden down without the city, the treading of the wine-press is the retribution on the sinner. </p>

<p><q>And blood went out from the wine-press, even unto the horse-bridles.</q> The vengeance of shed blood as was before predicted, <q>In blood you have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and blood shall follow you.</q>  </p>

<p><q>For a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</q> That is, through all the four parts of the world: for there is a quadrate put together by fours, as in four faces and four appearances, and wheels by fours; for forty times four is one thousand six hundred. Repeating the same <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the Apocalypse says:&mdash; </p>

<h2>From the Fifteenth Chapter</h2>

<p>1. <q>And I saw another great and wonderful sign, seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> having the seven last plagues; for in them is completed the indignation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God always strikes the obstinate people with seven plagues, that is, perfectly, as it is said in Leviticus; and these shall be in the last time, when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shall have gone out of the midst. </p>

<p>2. <q>Standing upon the sea of glass, having harps.</q> That is, that they stood steadfastly in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> upon their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and having their confession in their mouth, that they shall exult in the kingdom before God. But let us return to what is set before us. </p>

<h2>From the Seventeenth Chapter</h2>

<p>1-6. <q>There came one of the seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which have the seven bowls, and spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show you the judgment of that great whore who sits upon many waters. And I saw the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> drunk with the blood of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and with the blood of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.</q> The decrees of that senate are always accomplished against all, contrary to the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and now already mercy being cast aside, itself here gave the decree among all nations. </p>

<p>3. <q>And I saw the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> herself sitting upon the scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>.</q> But to sit upon the scarlet beast, the author of murders, is the image of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Where also <span style="italic">is treated</span> of his captivity, concerning which we have fully considered. I remember, indeed, that this is called <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> also in the Apocalypse, on account of confusion; and in Isaiah also; and Ezekiel called it <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>. In fine, if you compare what is said against <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and what Isaiah says against <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and what the Apocalypse says, you will find that they are all one.  </p>

<p>9. <q>The seven heads are the seven hills, on which the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> sits.</q> That is, the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. </p>

<p>10. <q>And there are seven kings: five have fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he has come, he will be for a short time.</q> The time must be understood in which the written Apocalypse was published, since then reigned C&aelig;sar <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>; but before him had been Titus his brother, and <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, Otho, Vitellius, and Galba. These are the five who have fallen. One remains, under whom the Apocalypse was written&mdash; <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, to wit. <q>The other has not yet come,</q> speaks of Nerva; <q>and when he has come, he will be for a short time,</q> for he did not complete the period of two years. </p>

<p>11. <q>And the beast which you saw is of the seven.</q> Since before those kings <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> reigned. </p>

<p><q>And he is the eighth.</q> He says only when this beast shall come, reckon it the eighth place, since in that is the completion. He added:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>And shall go into perdition.</q> For that ten kings received royal power when he shall move from the east, he says. He shall be sent from the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with his armies. And Daniel sets forth the ten horns and the ten diadems. And that these are eradicated from the former ones&mdash;that is, that three of the principal leaders are killed by <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>: that the other seven give him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and wisdom and power, of whom he says:&mdash; </p>

<p>16. <q>These shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the whore, to wit, the city, and shall burn her flesh with fire.</q> Now that one of the heads was, as it were, slain to death, and that the stroke of his death was directed, he speaks of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. For it is plain that when the cavalry sent by the senate was pursuing him, he himself cut his throat. Him therefore, when raised up, God will send as a worthy king, but worthy in such a way as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> merited. And since he is to have another name, He shall also appoint another name, that so the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> may receive him as if he were the Christ. Says Daniel: <q>He shall not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, although before he was most impure, and he shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no God of his fathers: for he will not be able to seduce the people of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, unless he is a judge of the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note072309"><a href="../bible/dan011.htm#verse37">Daniel&nbsp;11:37</a></span> Finally, also, he will recall the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, not to the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, but to undertake <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and, if he is able, to seduce any; for he shall so conduct himself as to be called Christ by them. But that he rises again from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, we have said above in the word of Isaiah: <q>Water shall nourish him, and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> has increased him;</q> who, however, must come with name unchanged, and doings unchanged, as says the Spirit. </p>

<h2>From the Nineteenth Chapter</h2>

<p>11. <q>And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True.</q> The horse, and He that sits upon him, sets forth our Lord coming to His kingdom with the heavenly army. Because from the sea of the north, which is the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> Sea, even to the sea of Ph&oelig;nice, and even to the ends of the earth, they will command these greater parts in the coming of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the nations will be assembled to judgment. </p>

<h2>From the Twentieth Chapter</h2>

<p>1-3. <q>And I saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> come down from heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a chain in his hand. And he held the dragon, that old serpent, which is called the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and bound him for a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a>, and cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a> should be finished: after this he must be loosed a little season.</q> Those years wherein <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> is bound are in the first advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even to the end of the age; and they are called a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand</a>, according to that mode of speaking, wherein a part is signified by the whole, just as is that passage, <q>the word which He commanded for a thousand generations,</q>  although they are not a thousand. Moreover that he says, <q>and he cast him into the abyss,</q> he says this, because the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, excluded from the hearts of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, began to take possession of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, in whose hearts, blinded day by day, he is shut up as if in a profound abyss. And he shut him up, says he, and put a seal upon him, that he should not deceive the nations until the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a> should be finished. <q>He shut the door upon him,</q> it is said, that is, he forbade and restrained his seducing those who belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Moreover, he put a seal upon him, because it is hidden who belong to the side of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and who to that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not of those who seem to stand whether they shall not fall, and of those who are down it is uncertain whether they may rise. Moreover, that he says that he is bound and shut up, that he may not seduce the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, the nations signify the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, seeing that of them it itself is formed, and which being seduced, he previously held until, he says, the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a> should be completed, that is, what is left of the sixth day, to wit, of the sixth age, which subsists for a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a>; after this he must be loosed for a little season. The little season signifies three years and six months, in which with all his power the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> will avenge himself under <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Finally, he says, after that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> shall be loosed, and will seduce the nations in the whole world, and will entice <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the number of whose foes shall be as the sand of the sea.  </p>

<p>4, 5. <q>And I saw thrones, and them that sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them; and <span style="italic">I saw</span> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of them that were slain on account of the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and for the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which had not worshipped the beast nor his image, nor have received his writing on their forehead or in their hand; and they reigned with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a>: the rest of them lived not again until the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a> were finished. This is the first resurrection.</q> There are two resurrections. But the first resurrection is now of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which does not permit men to pass over to the second death. Of this resurrection the apostle says: <q>If you have risen with Christ, seek those things which are above.</q>  </p>

<p>6. <q>Blessed and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> is he who has part in this resurrection: on them the second death shall have no power, but they shall be <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and they shall reign with Him a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a>.</q> I do not think the reign of a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; or if it is thus to be thought of, they cease to reign when the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a> are finished. But I will put forward what my capacity enables me to judge. The tenfold number signifies the decalogue, and the hundredfold sets forth the crown of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>: for he who shall have kept the undertaking of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> completely, and shall have faithfully fulfilled the precepts of the decalogue, and shall have destroyed the untrained nature or impure thoughts within the retirement of the heart, that they may not rule over him, this is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and accomplishing the millenary number thoroughly, is thought to reign with Christ; and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> in his case the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is bound. But he who is entangled in the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, in his case the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is loosed. But that it says that when the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a> are finished he is loosed, so the number of the perfect <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> being completed, in whom there is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> in body and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by the approaching advent of the kingdom of the hateful one, many, seduced by that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of earthly things, shall be overthrown, and together with him shall enter the lake of fire. </p>

<p>8-10. <q>And they went up upon the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> about, and the beloved city; and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who seduced them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where both the beast and the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a> shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</q> This belongs to the last judgment. And after a little time the earth was made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, as being at least that wherein lately had reposed the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, when they shall enter upon an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom with an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> King, as they who are not only <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in body, but, moreover, with equal inviolability have protected themselves, both in tongue and thought, from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; and these, it shows, shall dwell in rejoicing for ever with the Lamb. </p>

<h2>From the Twenty-First and Twenty-Second Chapters</h2>

<p>16. <q>And the city is placed in a square.</q> The city which he says is squared, he says also is resplendent with gold and precious stones, and has a sacred street, and a river through the midst of it, and the tree of life on either side, bearing twelve manner of fruits throughout the twelve months; and that the light of the sun is not there, because the Lamb is the light of it; and that its gates were of single pearls; and that there were three gates on each of the four sides, and that they could not be shut. I say, in respect of the square city, he shows forth the united multitude of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in whom the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> could by no means waver. As <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> is commanded to make the ark of squared beams,  that it might resist the force of the deluge, by the precious stones he sets forth the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men who cannot waver in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, who could not be moved either by the tempest of persecutors, or be dissolved from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the force of the rain, because they are associated of pure gold, of whom the city of the great King is adorned. Moreover, the streets set forth their hearts purified from all uncleanness, transparent with glowing light, that the Lord may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> walk up and down in them. The river of life sets forth that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of spiritual doctrine flowed through the minds of the faithful, and that manifold flourishing forms of odours germinated therein. The tree of life on either bank sets forth the Advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to the flesh, who satisfied the peoples wasted with famine, <span style="italic">that</span> received life from One by the wood of the Cross, with the announcement of God's word. And <span style="italic">in</span> that he says that the sun is not necessary in the city, <span style="italic">he</span> shows, evidently, that the Creator as the immaculate light shines in the midst of it, whose brightness no mind has been able to conceive, nor tongue to tell. </p>

<p>In that he says there are three gates placed on each of the four sides, of single pearls, I think that these are the four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>,  to wit, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which are associated with one another. And, being involved together, they make the number twelve. But the twelve gates we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be the number of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who, shining in the four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as precious stones, manifesting the light of their doctrine among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it to enter the celestial city, that by intercourse with them the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> may be gladdened. And that the gates cannot be shut, it is evidently shown that the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> can be separated from rectitude by no tempest of contradiction. Even though the floods of the nations and the vain <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should revolt against their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they are overcome, and shall be dissolved as the foam, because Christ is the Rock  by which, and on which, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is founded.  And thus it is overcome by no traces of maddened men. Therefore they are not to be heard who assure themselves that there is to be an earthly reign of a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a>; who think, <span style="italic">that is to say</span>, with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>.  For the kingdom of Christ is now <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall be manifested after the resurrection. </p>
