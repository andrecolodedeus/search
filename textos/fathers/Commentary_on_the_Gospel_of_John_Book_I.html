<h1>Commentary on the Gospel of John (Book I)</h1>

<h2>1. How Christians are the Spiritual Israel.</h2>

<p>That people which was called of old the people of God was divided into twelve tribes, and over and above the other tribes it had the levitical order, which itself again carried on the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in various <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> and levitical suborders. In the same manner, it appears to me that the whole people of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when we regard it in the aspect of the hidden man of the heart, <span class="stiki" id="note094455"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;2:29</a></span> that people which is called <q>Jew inwardly,</q> and is <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in the spirit, has in a more mystic way the characteristics of the tribes. This may be more plainly gathered from John in his Apocalyse, though the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also do not by any means conceal the state of matters from those who have the faculty of hearing them. John speaks as follows: <span class="stiki" id="note094456"><a href="../bible/rev007.htm#verse2">Revelation&nbsp;7:2-5</a></span> <q>And I saw another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> ascending from the sunrising, having the seal of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he cried with a loud voice to the four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not either the earth, or the sea, or the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads. And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand who were sealed, out of every tribe of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Roubem twelve thousand.</q> And he mentioned each of the tribes singly, with the exception of Dan. Then, some way further on, <span class="stiki" id="note094457"><a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse1">Revelation&nbsp;14:1-5</a></span> he continues: <q>And I saw, and behold the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder. And the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers harping with their harps; and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders, and no one could learn the song but the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth. These are they which were not defiled with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, for they are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. These are they who follow the Lamb whithersover He goes. These were purchased from among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, a first fruits to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to the Lamb; and in their mouth was found no lie, for they are without blemish.</q> Now this is said in John with reference to those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for they also, even if their bodily descent cannot be traced to the seed of the Patriarchs, are yet gathered out of the tribes. That this is so we may conclude from what is further said about them: <q>Hurt not,</q> he says, <q>the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads. And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed from every tribe of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q></p>

<h2>2. The 144,000 Sealed in the Apocalypse are Converts to Christ from the Gentile World.</h2>

<p>These, then, who are sealed on their foreheads <span class="stiki" id="note094458"><a href="../bible/rev007.htm#verse3">Revelation&nbsp;7:3-4</a></span> from every tribe of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, are a hundred and forty-four thousand in number; and these hundred and forty-four thousand are afterwards said in John to have the name of the Lamb and of His Father written on their foreheads, and to be <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, not having defiled themselves with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. What else could the seal be which is on their foreheads but the name of the Lamb and the name of His Father? In both passages their foreheads are said to have the seal; in one the seal is spoken of, in the other it appears to contain the letters forming the name of the Lamb, and the name of His Father. Now these taken from the tribes are, as we showed before, the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. But the number of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> is small who belong to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> according to the flesh; one might venture to assert that they would not nearly make up the number of a hundred and forty-four thousand. It is clear, therefore, that the hundred and forty-four thousand who have not defiled themselves with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> must be made up of those who have come to the divine word out of the Gentile world. In this way the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the statement may be upheld that the first fruits of each tribe are its <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. For the passage goes on: <q>These were brought from among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be a first fruits to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to the Lamb; and in their mouth was found no guile, for they are without blemish.</q> The statement about the hundred and forty-four thousand no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> admits of mystical interpretation; but it is unnecessary at this point, and would divert us from our purpose, to compare with it those passages of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in which the same lesson is taught regarding those who are called from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<h2>3. In the Spiritual Israel the High-Priests are Those Who Devote Themselves to the Study of Scripture.</h2>

<p>But what is the bearing of all this for us? So you will ask when you read these words, Ambrosius, you who are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a man in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and who seekest to be not a man only, but a spiritual man. <span class="stiki" id="note094459"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> The bearing is this. Those of the tribes offer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through the levites and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and first fruits; not everything which they possess do they regard as <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> or first fruit. The levites and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, on the other hand, have no possessions but <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and first fruits; yet they also in turn offer <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to God through the high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, first fruits too. The same is the case with those who approach <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> studies. Most of us devote most of our time to the things of this life, and dedicate to God only a few special acts, thus resembling those members of the tribes who had but few transactions with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and discharged their religious duties with no great expense of time. But those who devote themselves to the divine word and have no other employment but the service of God may not unnaturally, allowing for the difference of occupation in the two cases, be called our levites and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. And those who fulfil a more distinguished office than their kinsmen  will perhaps be high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, according to the order of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, not that of Melchisedek. Here some one may object that it is somewhat too bold to apply the name of high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, when Jesus Himself is spoken of in many a prophetic passage as the one great <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as <span class="stiki" id="note094461"><a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;4:14</a></span> <q>We have a great high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> But to this we reply that the Apostle clearly defined his meaning, and declared the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to have said about the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>You  are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever, according to the order of Melchisedek,</q> and not according to the order of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>. We say accordingly that men can be high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> according to the order of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, but according to the order of Melchisedek only the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>4. The Study of the Gospels is the First Fruits Offered by These Priests of Christianity.</h2>

<p>Now our whole activity is devoted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and our whole life, since we are bent on progress in divine things. If, then, it be our desire to have the whole of those first fruits spoken of above which are made up of the many first fruits, if we are not mistaken in this view, in what must our first fruits consist, after the bodily separation we have undergone from each other, but in the study of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>? For we may venture to say that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is the first fruits of all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. Where, then, could be the first fruits of our activity, since the time when we came to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, but in the first fruits of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>? It must not be forgotten, however, that the first fruits are not the same as the first growth. For the first fruits  are offered after all the fruits (are ripe), but the first growth  before them all. Now of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which are current and are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be divine in all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, one would not be wrong in saying that the first growth is the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, but the first fruits the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For it was after all the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who prophesied till the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, that the perfect word shot forth.</p>

<h2>5. All Scripture is Gospel; But the Gospels are Distinguished Above Other Scriptures.</h2>

<p>Here, however, some one may object, appealing to the notion just put forward of the unfolding of the first fruits last, and may say that the Acts and the letters of the Apostles came after the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and that this destroys our argument to the effect that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is the first fruits of all Scripture. To this we must reply that it is the conviction of men who are wise in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who have profited by those epistles which are current, and who see them to be vouched for by the testimonies deposited in the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,  that the apostolic writings are to be pronounced wise and worthy of belief, and that they have great authority, but that they are not on the same level with that <q>Thus says the Lord Almighty.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note094466"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:18</a></span> Consider on this point the language of St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. When he declares that <span class="stiki" id="note094467"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:16</a></span> <q>Every Scripture is inspired of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and profitable,</q> does he include his own writings? Or does he not include his dictum, <span class="stiki" id="note094468"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:12</a></span> <q>I say, and not the Lord,</q> and <span class="stiki" id="note094469"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:17</a></span> <q>So I ordain in all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>,</q> and <span class="stiki" id="note094470"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:11</a></span> <q>What things I suffered at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, at Iconium, at Lystra,</q> and similar things which he writes in virtue of his own authority, and which do not quite possess the character of words flowing from divine inspiration. Must we also show that the old Scripture is not <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, since it does not point out the Coming One, but only foretells Him and heralds His coming at a future time; but that all the new Scripture is the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. It not only says as in the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note094471"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> <q>Behold the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world;</q> it also contains many praises of Him, and many of His teachings, on whose account the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Again, if God set in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <span class="stiki" id="note094472"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse11">Ephesians&nbsp;4:11</a></span> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> (gospellers), pastors and teachers, we must first enquire what was the office of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, and mark that it is not only to narrate how the Saviour cured a man who was blind from his birth, <span class="stiki" id="note094473"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;9:1</a></span> or raised up a dead man who was already stinking, <span class="stiki" id="note094474"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;11:39</a></span> or to state what extraordinary works he wrought; and the office of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> being thus defined, we shall not hesitate to find <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in such discourse also as is not narrative but hortatory and intended to strengthen belief in the mission of Jesus; and thus we shall arrive at the position that whatever was written by the Apostles is <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. As to this second definition, it might be objected that the Epistles are not entitled <q><a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,</q> and that we are wrong in applying the name of <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to the whole of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. But to this we answer that it happens not unfrequently in Scripture when two or more <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or things are named by the same name, the name attaches itself most significantly to one of those things or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Thus the Saviour says, <span class="stiki" id="note094475"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;23:8-9</a></span> <q>Call no man Master upon the earth;</q> while the Apostle says that Masters  have been appointed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. These latter accordingly will not be Masters in the strict sense of the dictum of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. In the same way the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in the Epistles will not extend to every word of them, when it is compared with the narrative of Jesus' actions and sufferings and discourses. No: the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is the first fruits of all Scripture, and to these first fruits of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> we devote the first fruits of all those actions of ours which we trust to see turn out as we desire.</p>

<h2>6. The Fourfold Gospel. John's the First Fruits of the Four. Qualifications Necessary for Interpreting It.</h2>

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> are four. These four are, as it were, the elements of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, out of which elements the whole world which is reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Christ is put together; as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <span class="stiki" id="note094477"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:19</a></span> <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, reconciling the world to Himself;</q> of which world Jesus bore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for it is of the world of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that the word is written, <span class="stiki" id="note094478"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> <q>Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world.</q> The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> then being four, I deem the first fruits of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> to be that which you  have enjoined me to search into according to my powers, the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Gospel of John</a>, that which speaks of him whose genealogy had already been set forth, but which begins to speak of him at a point before he had any genealogy. For Matthew, writing for the Hebrews who looked for Him who was to come of the line of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and of David, says: <span class="stiki" id="note094480"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;1:1</a></span> <q>The book of the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the son of David, the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> And Mark, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what he writes, narrates the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; we may perhaps find what he aims at in John; in the beginning the Word, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>. But Luke, though he says at the beginning of Acts, <q>The former treatise did I make about all that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> began to do and to teach,</q> yet leaves to him who lay on Jesus' breast the greatest and completest discourses about Jesus. For none of these plainly declared His Godhead, as John does when he makes Him say, <q>I am the light of the world,</q> <q>I am the way and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the life,</q> <q>I am the resurrection,</q> <q>I am the door,</q> <q>I am the good shepherd;</q> and in the Apocalypse, <q>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.</q> We may therefore make bold to say that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> are the first fruits of all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, but that of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> that of John is the first fruits. No one can apprehend the meaning of it except he have lain on Jesus' breast and received from Jesus Mary to be his mother also. Such an one must he become who is to be another John, and to have shown to him, like John, by Jesus Himself Jesus as He is. For if Mary, as those declare who with sound mind extol her, had no other son but Jesus, and yet Jesus says to His mother, <q>Woman, behold your son,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note094481"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;19:26</a></span> and not <q>Behold you have this son also,</q> then He virtually said to her, <q>Lo, this is Jesus, whom you bore.</q> Is it not the case that every one who is perfect lives himself no longer, <span class="stiki" id="note094482"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> but Christ lives in him; and if Christ lives in him, then it is said of him to Mary, <q>Behold your son Christ.</q> What a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, then, must we have to enable us to interpret in a worthy manner this work, though it be committed to the earthly treasure-house of common speech, of writing which any passer-by can read, and which can be heard when read aloud by any one who lends to it his bodily ears? What shall we say of this work? He who is accurately to apprehend what it contains should be able to say with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,  <q>We have the mind of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those things which are bestowed on us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> It is possible to quote one of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> sayings in support of the contention that the whole of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. He writes in a certain place: <span class="stiki" id="note094484"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;2:16</a></span> <q>According to my <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q> Now we have no written work of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> which is commonly called a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. But all that he preached and said was the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; and what he preached and said he was also in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of writing, and what he wrote was therefore <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. But if what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wrote was <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, it follows that what Peter wrote was also <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and in a word all that was said or written to perpetuate the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sojourn on earth, and to prepare for His second coming, or to bring it about as a present reality in those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which were willing to receive the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> as He stood at the door and knocked and sought to come into them.</p>

<h2>7. What Good Things are Announced in the Gospels.</h2>

<p>But it is time we should inquire what is the meaning of the designation <q><a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,</q> and why these books have this title. Now the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is a discourse containing a promise of things which naturally, and on account of the benefits they bring, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> the hearer as soon as the promise is heard and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Nor is such a discourse any the less a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that we define it with reference to the position of the hearer. A <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is either a word which implies the actual presence to the believer of something that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or a word promising the arrival of a good which is expected. Now all these definitions apply to those books which are named <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. For each of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> is a collection of announcements which are useful to him who believes them and does not misinterpret them; it brings him a benefit and naturally makes him glad because it tells of the sojourn with men, on account of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of all creation, <span class="stiki" id="note094485"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;1:15</a></span> Christ Jesus. And again each <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> tells of the sojourn of the good Father in the Son with those minded to receive Him, as is plain to every believer; and moreover by these books a good is announced which had been formerly expected, as is by no means hard to see. For John the Baptist spoke in the name almost of the whole people when he sent to Jesus and asked, <span class="stiki" id="note094486"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;11:3</a></span> <q>Are you He that should come or do we look for another?</q> For to the people the Messiah was an expected good, which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had foretold, and they all alike, though under the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, fixed their hopes on Him, as the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> when she says: <span class="stiki" id="note094487"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;4:25</a></span> <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Messiah comes, who is called Christ; when He comes He will tell us all things.</q> Simon and Cleopas too, when talking to each other about all that had happened to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Himself, then risen, though they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He had risen from the dead, speak thus, <span class="stiki" id="note094488"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;24:18-21</a></span> <q>Do you sojourn alone in Jerusalem, and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> not the things which have taken place there in these days? And when he said what things? They answered, The things concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>,  which was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, mighty in deed and in word before God and all the people, and how the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and our rulers delivered Him up to be sentenced to death and crucified Him. But we hoped that it was He which should redeem <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> Again, Andrew the brother of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> found his own brother Simon and said to him, <span class="stiki" id="note094490"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse42">John&nbsp;1:42</a></span> <q>We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, Christ.</q> And a little further on Philip finds Nathanael and says to him, <span class="stiki" id="note094491"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse46">John&nbsp;1:46</a></span> <q>We have found Him of whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the law, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, wrote, Jesus the son of Joseph, from <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>.</q></p>

<h2>8. How the Gospels Cause the Other Books of Scripture Also to Be Gospel.</h2>

<p>Now an objection might be raised to our first definition, because it would embrace books which are not entitled <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. For the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also are to our eyes books containing the promise of things which, from the benefit they will confer on him, naturally <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> the hearer as soon as he takes in the message. To this it may be said that before the sojourn of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, since He had not come who interpreted the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> they contained, did not convey such a promise as belongs to our definition of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, when He sojourned with men and caused the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to appear in bodily form, by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> caused all things to appear as <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Here I would not think it beside the purpose to quote the example of Him who...a few things...and yet all.  For when he had taken away the veil which was present in the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and by His divinity had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the sons of men that the Godhead was at work, He opened the way for all those who desired it to be <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of His wisdom, and to understand what things were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and real in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, of which things those of old worshipped the type and the shadow, and what things were real of the things narrated in the histories which <q>happened to them in the way of type,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note094493"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:11</a></span> but these things <q>were written for our sakes, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.</q> With whomsoever, then, Christ has sojourned, he worships God neither at Jerusalem nor on the mountain of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>; he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that God is a spirit, and worships Him spiritually, in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; no longer by type does he worship the Father and Maker of all. Before that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, therefore, which came into being by the sojourning of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, none of the older works was a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which is the new covenant, having delivered us from the oldness of the letter, lights up for us, by the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,  the newness of the spirit, a thing which never grows old, which has its home in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, but is also present in all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. It was fitting, therefore, that that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which enables us to find the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> present, even in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, should itself receive, in a special sense, the name of <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<h2>9. The Somatic and the Spiritual Gospel.</h2>

<p>We must not, however, forget that the sojourning of Christ with men took place before His bodily sojourn, in an intellectual fashion, to those who were more perfect and not children, and were not under pedagogues and governors. In their minds they saw the fullness of the time to be at hand&mdash; the patriarchs, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who beheld the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And as before His manifest and bodily coming He came to those who were perfect, so also, after His coming has been announced to all, to those who are still children, since they are under pedagogues and governors and have not yet arrived at the fullness of the time, forerunners of Christ have come to sojourn, discourses (<em>logoi</em>) suited for minds still in their childhood, and rightly, therefore, termed pedagogues. But the Son Himself, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Word, has not yet come; He waits for the preparation which must take place on the part of men of God who are to admit His deity. And this, too, we must bear in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that as the law contains a shadow of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come, which are indicated by that law which is announced according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> also teaches a shadow of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which is thought to be capable of being understood by any one. What John calls the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and what may properly be called the spiritual <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, presents clearly to those who have the will to understand, all matters concerning the very <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, both the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> presented by His discourses and those matters of which His acts were the enigmas. In accordance with this we may conclude that, as it is with Him who is a Jew outwardly and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in the flesh, so it is with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Peter were, at an earlier period, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> outwardly and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, but later they received from Christ that they should be so in secret, too; so that outwardly they were <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of many, and by an economy they not only confessed in words that they were <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but showed it by their actions. And the same is to be said about their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. As <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> could not benefit those who were <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> according to the flesh, without, when reason shows it to be necessary, circumcising Timothy, and when it appears the natural course getting himself shaved and making a vow, and, in a word, being to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a Jew that he might gain the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>&mdash; so also it is not possible for one who is responsible for the good of many to operate as he should by means of that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> only which is in secret. That will never enable him to improve those who are following the external <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, or to lead them on to better and higher things. We must, therefore, be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> both somatically and spiritually, and where there is a call for the somatic (bodily) <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, in which a man says to those who are carnal that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and Him crucified, so we must do. But should we find those who are perfected in the spirit, and bear fruit in it, and are enamoured of the heavenly wisdom, these must be made to partake of that Word which, after it was made flesh, rose again to what it was in the beginning, with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>10. How Jesus Himself is the Gospel.</h2>

<p>The foregoing inquiry into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> cannot be regarded as useless; it has enabled us to see what distinction there is between a sensible <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and an intellectual and spiritual one. What we have now to do is to transform the sensible <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> into a spiritual one.</p>

<p>For what would the narrative of the sensible <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> amount to if it were not developed to a spiritual one? It would be of little account or none; any one can read it and assure himself of the facts it tells&mdash; no more. But our whole energy is now to be directed to the effort to penetrate to the deep things of the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and to search out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that is in it when divested of types. Now what the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> say is to be regarded in the light of promises of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; and we must say that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things the Apostles announce in this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> are simply Jesus. One good thing which they are said to announce is the resurrection; but the resurrection is in a manner Jesus, for Jesus says: <span class="stiki" id="note094495"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;11:25</a></span> <q>I am the resurrection.</q> Jesus preaches to the poor those things which are laid up for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, calling them to the divine promises. And the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> announcements made by the Apostles and to that made by our Saviour. David says of the Apostles, perhaps also of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>:  <q>The Lord shall give the word to those that preach with great power; the King of the powers of the beloved;</q> teaching at the same time that it is not skilfully composed discourse, nor the mode of delivery, nor well practised eloquence that produces conviction, but the communication of divine power. Hence also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says:  <q>I will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the word that is puffed up, but the power; for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.</q> And in another passage: <span class="stiki" id="note094498"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:4</a></span> <q>And my word and my preaching were not persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power.</q> To this power Simon and Cleophas bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> when they say: <span class="stiki" id="note094499"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;24:32</a></span> <q>Was not our heart burning within us by the way, as he opened to us the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>?</q> And the Apostles, since the quantity of the power is great which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> supplies to the speakers, had great power, according to the word of David: <q>The Lord will give the word to the preachers with great power.</q> Isaiah too says:  <q>How beautiful are the feet of them that proclaim good tidings;</q> he sees how beautiful and how opportune was the announcement of the Apostles who walked in Him who said, <q>I am the way,</q> and praises the feet of those who walk in the intellectual way of Christ Jesus, and through that door go in to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They announce good tidings, those whose feet are beautiful, namely, Jesus.</p>

<h2>11. Jesus is All Good Things; Hence the Gospel is Manifold.</h2>

<p>Let no one wonder if we have understood Jesus to be announced in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> under a plurality of names of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. If we look at the things by the names of which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is called, we shall understand how many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things Jesus is, whom those preach whose feet are beautiful. One good thing is life; but Jesus is the life. Another good thing is the light of the world, when it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, and the light of men; and all these things the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is said to be. And another good thing which one may conceive to be in addition to life or light is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And a fourth in addition to time is the way which leads to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And all these things our Saviour teaches that He is, when He says: <span class="stiki" id="note094501"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> <q>I am the way and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the life.</q> Ah, is not that good, to shake off earth and mortality, and to rise again, obtaining this boon from the Lord, since He is the resurrection, as He says: <span class="stiki" id="note094502"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;11:25</a></span> <q>I am the resurrection.</q> But the door also is a good, through which one enters into the highest blessedness. Now Christ says: <span class="stiki" id="note094503"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;10:9</a></span> <q>I am the door.</q> And what need is there to speak of wisdom, which <q>the Lord created <span class="stiki" id="note094504"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;8:22</a></span> the first principle of His ways, for His works,</q> in whom the father of her rejoiced, delighting in her manifold intellectual beauty, seen by the eyes of the mind alone, and provoking him to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> who discerns her divine and heavenly charm? A good indeed is the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, proclaimed along with the other good foresaid by those whose feet are beautiful. And the power of God is the eighth good we enumerate, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Nor must we omit to mention the Word, who is God after the Father of all. For this also is a good, less than no other. Happy, then, are those who accept these goods and receive them from those who announce the good tidings of them, those whose feet are beautiful. Indeed even one of the Corinthians to whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declared that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and Him crucified, should he learn Him who for our sakes became man, and so receive Him, he would become identified with the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things we have spoken of; by the man Jesus he would be made a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by His death he would die to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <q>Christ, <span class="stiki" id="note094505"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;6:10</a></span> in that He died, died unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> once.</q> But from His life, since <q>in that He lives, He lives unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> every one who is conformed to His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> receives that living to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But who will deny that righteousness, essential righteousness, is a good, and essential sanctification, and essential redemption? And these things those preach who preach Jesus, saying <span class="stiki" id="note094506"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse30">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:30</a></span> that He is made to be of God righteousness and sanctification and redemption. Hence we shall have writings about Him without number, showing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is a multitude of goods; for from the things which can scarcely be numbered and which have been written we may make some conjecture of those things which actually exist in Him in whom  <q>it pleased God that the whole fullness of the Godhead should dwell bodily,</q> and which are not contained in writings. Why should I say, <q>are not contained in writings</q>? For John speaks of the whole world in this connection, and says: <span class="stiki" id="note094508"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;21:25</a></span> <q>I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books which would be written.</q> Now to say that the Apostles preach the Saviour is to say that they preach these <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. For this is He who received from the good Father that He Himself should be these <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, so that each man receiving from Jesus the thing or things he is capable of receiving may enjoy <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. But the Apostles, whose feet were beautiful, and those imitators of them who sought to preach the good tidings, could not have done so had not Jesus Himself first preached the good tidings to them, as Isaiah says: <span class="stiki" id="note094509"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;52:6</a></span> <q>I myself that speak am here, as the opportunity on the mountains, as the feet of one preaching tidings of peace, as one preaching <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; for I will make My <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to be heard, saying, God shall reign over you, O Zion!</q> For what are the mountains on which the speaker declares that He Himself is present, but those who are less than none of the highest and the greatest of the earth? And these must be sought by the able ministers of the New Covenant, in order that they may observe the injunction which says: <span class="stiki" id="note094510"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;40:9</a></span> Go up into a high mountain, you that preachest good tidings to Zion; you that preachest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with strength! Now it is not wonderful if to those who are to preach good tidings Jesus Himself preaches good tidings of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, which are no other than Himself; for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> preaches the good tidings of Himself to those who cannot come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him through others. And He who goes up into the mountains and preaches <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to them, being Himself instructed by His good Father, <span class="stiki" id="note094511"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> who <q>makes His sun to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>,</q> He does not despise those who are poor in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. To them He preaches good tidings, as He Himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to us when He takes Isaiah  and reads: <q>The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for the Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to the blind. For closing the book He handed it to the minister and sat down. And when the eyes of all were fastened upon Him, He said, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.</q></p>

<h2>12. The Gospel Contains the Ill Deeds Also Which Were Done to Jesus.</h2>

<p>It ought not to be forgotten that in such a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> as this there is embraced every good deed which was done to Jesus; as, for example, the story of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>  who had been a sinner and had repented, and who, having experienced a genuine recovery from her <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> state, had <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to pour her ointment over Jesus so that every one in the house smelt the sweet savour. Hence, too, the words, <q>Wherever this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> shall be preached among all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, there also this that she has done shall be spoken of, for a memorial of her.</q> And it is clear that whatever is done to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is done to Him. Pointing to those of them who met with kind treatment, He says to those who were kind to them, <span class="stiki" id="note094514"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;25:40</a></span> <q>What ye did to these, you did to Me.</q> So that every good deed we do to our neighbours is entered in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which is written on the heavenly tablets and read by all who are worthy of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the whole of things. But on the other side, too, there is a part of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which is for the condemnation of the doers of the ill <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which have been done to Jesus. The treachery of Judas and the shouts of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> crowd when it said, <span class="stiki" id="note094515"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;19:6,&nbsp;15</a></span> <q>Away with such a one from the earth,</q> and <q>Crucify Him, crucify Him,</q> the mockings of those who crowned Him with thorns, and everything of that kind, is included in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. And as a consequence of this we see that every one who betrays the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is reckoned as betraying Jesus Himself. To Saul, <span class="stiki" id="note094516"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;9:4-5</a></span> when still a persecutor it is said, <q>Saul Saul, why do you persecute Me?</q> and, <q>I am Jesus whom you persecute.</q> There are those who still have thorns with which they crown and dishonour Jesus, those, namely, who are choked by the cares, and riches, and pleasures of life, and though they have received the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do not bring it to perfection. <span class="stiki" id="note094517"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;8:14</a></span> We must beware, therefore, lest we also, as crowning Jesus with thorns of our own, should be entered in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and read of in this character by those who learn the Jesus, who is in all and is present in all rational and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> lives, learn how He is anointed with ointment, is entertained, is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, or how, on the other side, He is dishonoured, and mocked, and beaten. All this had to be said; it is part of our demonstration that our good actions, and also the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who stumble, are embodied in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, either to everlasting life or to reproach and everlasting shame.</p>

<h2>13. The Angels Also are Evangelists.</h2>

<p>Now if there are those among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are honoured with the ministry of <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, and if Jesus Himself brings tidings of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and preaches the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, surely those messengers who were made spirits by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  those who are a flame of fire, ministers of the Father of all, cannot have been excluded from being <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> also. Hence an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> standing over the shepherds made a bright light to shine round about them, and said: <span class="stiki" id="note094519"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;2:10-11</a></span> <q>Fear not; behold I bring you good tidings of great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, which shall be to all the people; for there is born to you, this day, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David.</q> And at a time when there was no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, those who were greater than men and inhabitants of heaven, the army of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, praised <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, <q>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, and on earth peace, good will among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q>  And having said this, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> go away from the shepherds into heaven, leaving us to gather how the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> preached to us through the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the highest to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; they humbled themselves even to the ground, and then returned to their place of rest, to glorify God in the highest through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> also wonder at the peace which is to be brought about on account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> on the earth, that seat of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, on which Lucifer, star of the morning, fell from heaven, to be warred against and destroyed by Jesus.</p>

<h2>14. The Old Testament, Typified by John, is the Beginning of the Gospel.</h2>

<p>In addition to what we have said, there is also this to be considered about the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that in the first instance it is that of Christ Jesus, the head of the whole body of the saved; as Mark says, <span class="stiki" id="note094521"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse1">Mark&nbsp;1:1</a></span> <q>The beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> Then also it is the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the Apostles; whence <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <span class="stiki" id="note094522"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;2:16</a></span> says, <q>According to my <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q> But the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>&mdash; for in respect of its extent it has a beginning, a continuation, a middle, and an end&mdash; is nothing but the whole <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. John is, in this respect, a type of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, or, if we regard the connection of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> with the Old, John represents the termination of the Old. For the same Mark says:  <q>The beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as it is written in Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, Behold I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.</q> And here I must wonder how the dissentients  can connect the two Testaments with two different Gods. These words, were there no others, are enough to convict them of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For how can John be the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> if they suppose he belongs to a different <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if he belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demiurge</a>, and, as they hold, is not acquainted with the new deity? And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not entrusted with but one evangelical ministry, and that a short one, not only with that addressed to the shepherds. For at the end an exalted and flying <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, having the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, will preach it to every nation, for the good Father has not entirely deserted those who have fallen away from Him. John, son of Zebedee, says in his Apocalypse: <span class="stiki" id="note094525"><a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse6">Revelation&nbsp;14:6-7</a></span> <q>And I saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> flying in the midst of heaven, having the Eternal <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, to preach it to those who dwell upon the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people, saying, with a loud voice, Fear God and give Him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, for the hour of His judgment has come, and worship Him that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</q></p>

<h2>15. The Gospel is in the Old Testament, and Indeed in the Whole Universe. Prayer for Aid to Understand the Mystical Sense of the Work in Hand.</h2>

<p>As, then, we have shown that the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, according to one interpretation, is the whole <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and is signified by the person of John, we shall add, lest this should be called a mere unsupported assertion, what is said in the Acts  about the eunuch of the queen of the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> and Philip. Philip, it is said, began at the passage of Isaiah: <q>He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb,</q> and so preached to him the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. How can he begin with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and preach Jesus, if Isaiah was not a part of the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>? From this we may derive a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the assertion made at the outset, that every <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> is <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. If he who preaches the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> preaches <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and all those who spoke before the sojourn of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the flesh preach Christ, who is as we saw <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, then the words spoken by all of them alike are in a sense a part of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. And when the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is said to be declared throughout the whole world, we infer that it is actually preached in the whole world, not, that is to say, in this earthly district only, but in the whole system of heaven and earth, or from heaven and earth. And why should we discuss any further what the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is? What we have said is enough. Besides the passages we have adduced, passages by no means inept or unsuited for our purpose&mdash;much to the same effect might be collected from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, so that it is clearly seen what is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> shed forth by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> ministered by men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, also by authorities and powers, <span class="stiki" id="note094527"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse21">Ephesians&nbsp;1:21</a></span> and thrones and dominions, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in the world to come, and indeed even by Christ Himself. Here, then, let us bring to a close what has to be said before proceeding to read the work itself. And now let us ask God to assist us through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, so that we may be able to unfold the mystical sense which is treasured up in the words before us.</p>

<h2>16. Meaning of <q>Beginning.</q> (1) in Space.</h2>

<p><q> <em>In the beginning was the Word.</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note094528"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> It is not only the Greeks who consider the word <q>beginning</q> to have many meanings. Let any one collect the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> passages in which the word occurs, and with a view to an accurate interpretation of it note what it stands for in each passage, and he will find that the word has many meanings in sacred discourse also. We speak of a beginning in reference to a transition. Here it has to do with a road and with length. This appears in the saying: <span class="stiki" id="note094529"><a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse5">Proverbs&nbsp;16:5</a></span> <q>The beginning of a good way is to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</q> For since the good way is long, there have first to be considered in reference to it the question connected with action, and this side is presented in the words <q>to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>;</q> the contemplative side comes up for consideration afterwards. In the latter the end of it comes to rest at last in the so-called restoration of all things, since no enemy is left them to fight against, if that be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which is said: <span class="stiki" id="note094530"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:25-26</a></span> <q>For He must reign until He have placed His enemies under His feet. But the last enemy to be destroyed is death.</q> For then but one activity will be left for those who have come to God on account of His word which is with Him, that, namely, of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that, being found by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, they may all be His Son, as now no one but the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father. For should any one enquire carefully at what time those are to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father to whom He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father reveals Him, and should he consider how a man now sees only through a glass and in a riddle, never having learned to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as he ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, he would be justified in saying that no one, no apostle even, and no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but when he became one with Him as a son and a father are one. And if any one says that it is a digression which has led us to this point, our consideration of that one meaning of the word beginning, we must show that the digression is necessary and useful for the end we have in view. For if we speak of a beginning in the case of a transition, and of a way and its length, and if we are told that the beginning of a good way is to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, then it concerns us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what manner every good way has for its beginning to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and how after such beginning it arrives at <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, and in what manner it thus arrives at <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.</p>

<h2>17. (2) in Time. The Beginning of Creation.</h2>

<p>Again, there is a beginning in a matter of origin, as might appear in the saying: <span class="stiki" id="note094531"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a></span> <q>In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.</q> This meaning, however, appears more plainly in the Book of Job in the passage: <span class="stiki" id="note094532"><a href="../bible/job040.htm#verse19">Job&nbsp;40:19</a></span> <q>This is the beginning of God's creation, made for His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to mock at.</q> One would suppose that the heavens and the earth were made first, of all that was made at the creation of the world. But the second passage suggests a better view, namely, that as many beings were framed with a body, the first made of these was the creature called dragon, but called in another passage <span class="stiki" id="note094533"><a href="../bible/job003.htm#verse8">Job&nbsp;3:8</a></span> the great whale (leviathan) which the Lord tamed. We must ask about this; whether, when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were living a blessed life apart from matter and from any body, the dragon, falling from the pure life, became fit to be bound in matter and in a body, so that the Lord could say, speaking through storm and clouds, <q>This is the beginning of the creation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, made for His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to mock at.</q> It is possible, however, that the dragon is not positively the beginning of the creation of the Lord, but that there were many creatures made with a body for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to mock, and that the dragon was the first of these, while others could subsist in a body without such reproach. But it is not so. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the sun is placed in a body, and the whole creation, of which the Apostle says:  <q>The whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now,</q> and perhaps the following is about the same: <q>The creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it for hope;</q> so that bodies might be in vanity, and doing the things of the body, as he who is in the body must.. ..One who is in the body does the things of the body, though unwillingly. Wherefore the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but he who does unwillingly the things of the body does what he does for the sake of hope, as if we should say that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> desired to remain in the flesh, not willingly, but on account of hope. For though he thought it better <span class="stiki" id="note094536"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> to be dissolved and to be with Christ, it was not unreasonable that he should wish to remain in the flesh for the sake of the benefit to others and of advancement in the things hoped for, not only by him, but also by those benefited by him. This meaning of the term <q>beginning,</q> as of origin, will serve us also in the passage in which Wisdom speaks in the Proverbs.  <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> we read, <q>created me the beginning of His ways, for His works.</q> Here the term could be interpreted as in the first application we spoke of, that of a way: <q>The Lord,</q> it says, <q>created me the beginning of His ways.</q> One might assert, and with reason, that God Himself is the beginning of all things, and might go on to say, as is plain, that the Father is the beginning of the Son; and the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demiurge</a> the beginning of the works of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demiurge</a>, and that God in a word is the beginning of all that exists. This view is supported by our: <q>In the beginning was the Word.</q> In the Word one may see the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and because He is in the Father He may be said to be in the beginning.</p>

<h2>18. (3) of Substance.</h2>

<p>In the third place a beginning may be that out of which a thing comes, the underlying matter from which things are formed. This, however, is the view of those who hold matter itself to be uncreated, a view which we <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> cannot share, since we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> God to have made the things that are out of the things which are not, as the mother of the seven <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the Maccabees teaches, <span class="stiki" id="note094538"><a href="../bible/2ma007.htm#verse28">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;7:28</a></span> and as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of repentance in the Shepherd inculcated. </p>

<h2>19. (4) of Type and Copy.</h2>

<p>In addition to these meanings there is that in which we speak of an arche,  according to form; thus if the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature <span class="stiki" id="note094541"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;1:15</a></span> is the image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then the Father is his arche. In the same way Christ is the arche of those who are made according to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if men are according to the image, but the image according to the Father; in the first case the Father is the arche of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and in the other Christ is the arche of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and men are made, not according to that of which he is the image, but according to the image. With this example our passage will agree: <q>In the arche was the Word.</q></p>

<h2>20. (5) of Elements and What is Formed from Them.</h2>

<p>There is also an arche in a matter of learning, as when we say that the letters are the arche of grammar. The Apostle accordingly says: <span class="stiki" id="note094542"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse12">Hebrews&nbsp;5:12</a></span> <q>When by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again that some one teach you what are the elements of the arche of the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Now the arche spoken of in connection with learning is twofold; first in respect of its nature, secondly in its relation to us; as we might say of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that by nature His arche is deity, but that in relation to us who cannot, for its very greatness, command the whole <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about Him, His arche is His manhood, as He is preached to babes, <q><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and Him crucified.</q> In this view, then, Christ is the arche of learning in His own nature, because He is the wisdom and power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but for us, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, that He might tabernacle among us who could only thus at first receive Him. And perhaps this is the reason why He is not only the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> of all creation, but is also designated the man, Adam. For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says He is Adam: <span class="stiki" id="note094543"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse45">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:45</a></span> <q>The last <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was made a life-giving spirit.</q></p>

<h2>21. (6) of Design and Execution.</h2>

<p>Again we speak of the arche of an action, in which there is a design which appears after the beginning. It may be considered whether wisdom is to be regarded as the arche of the works of God because it is in this way the principle of them.</p>

<h2>22. The Word Was in the Beginning, I.e., in Wisdom, Which Contained All Things in Idea, Before They Existed. Christ's Character as Wisdom is Prior to His Other Characters.</h2>

<p>So many meanings occur to us at once of the word arche. We have now to ask which of them we should adopt for our text, <q>In the beginning was the Word.</q> It is plain that we may at once dismiss the meaning which connects it with transition or with a road and its length. Nor, it is pretty plain, will the meaning connected with an origin serve our purpose. One might, however, think of the sense in which it points to the author, to that which brings about the effect, if, as we read,  <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commanded and they were created.</q> For Christ is, in a manner, the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demiurge</a>, to whom the Father says, <q>Let there be light,</q> and <q>Let there be a firmament.</q> But Christ is <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demiurge</a> as a beginning (arche), inasmuch as He is wisdom. It is in virtue of His being wisdom that He is called arche. For Wisdom says in Solomon: <span class="stiki" id="note094545"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;8:22</a></span> <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created me the beginning of His ways, for His works,</q> so that the Word might be in an arche, namely, in wisdom. Considered in relation to the structure of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and thoughts about the whole of things, it is regarded as wisdom; but in relation to that side of the objects of thought, in which reasonable beings apprehend them, it is considered as the Word. And there is no wonder, since, as we have said before, the Saviour is many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, if He comprises in Himself thoughts of the first order, and of the second, and of the third. This is what John suggested when he said about the Word: <span class="stiki" id="note094546"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3-4</a></span> <q>That which was made was life in Him.</q> Life then came in the Word. And on the one side the Word is no other than the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Word, He who was with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by whom all things were made; while, on the other side, the Life is no other than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who says: <span class="stiki" id="note094547"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> <q>I am the way and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the life.</q> As, then, life came into being in the Word, so the Word in the arche. Consider, however, if we are at liberty to take this meaning of arche for our text: <q>In the beginning was the Word,</q> so as to obtain the meaning that all things came into being according to wisdom and according to the models of the system which are present in his thoughts. For I consider that as a house or a ship is built and fashioned in accordance with the sketches of the builder or designer, the house or the ship having their beginning (arche) in the sketches and reckonings in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so all things came into being in accordance with the designs of what was to be, clearly laid down by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in wisdom. And we should add that having created, so to speak, ensouled  wisdom, He left her to hand over, from the types which were in her, to things existing and to matter, the actual emergence of them, their moulding and their forms<span class="sc">.  </span> But I consider, if it be permitted to say this, that the beginning (arche) of real <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, saying: <span class="stiki" id="note094550"><a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse13">Revelation&nbsp;22:13</a></span> <q>I am the beginning and the end, the <span class="greek">&#x0391;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x03A9;</span>, the first and the last.</q> We must, however, remember that He is not the arche in respect of every name which is applied to Him. For how can He be the beginning in respect of His being life, when life came in the Word, and the Word is manifestly the arche of life? It is also tolerably evident that He cannot be the arche in respect of His being the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> from the dead. And if we go through all His titles carefully we find that He is the arche only in respect of His being wisdom. Not even as the Word is He the arche, for the Word was in the arche. And so one might venture to say that wisdom is anterior to all the thoughts that are expressed in the titles of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature. Now God is altogether one and simple; but our Saviour, for many reasons, since God <span class="stiki" id="note094551"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;3:25</a></span> set Him forth a propitiation and a first fruits of the whole creation, is made many things, or perhaps all these things; the whole creation, so far as capable of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, stands in need of Him.  And, hence, He is made the light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because men, being darkened by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, need the light that shines in darkness, and is not overtaken by the darkness; had not men been in darkness, He would not have become the light of men. The same thing may be observed in respect of His being the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of the dead. For supposing the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had not been deceived, and <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had not fallen, and man created for incorruption had obtained it, then He would not have descended into the grave, nor would He have died, there being no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor would His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of men have required that He should die, and if He had not died, He could not have been the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of the dead. We may also ask whether He would ever have become a shepherd, had man not been thrown together with the beasts which are devoid of reason, and made like to them. For if God saves man and beasts, He saves those beasts which He does save, by giving them a shepherd, since they cannot have a king. Thus if we collect the titles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the question arises which of them were conferred on Him later, and would never have assumed such importance if the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> had begun and had also persevered in blessedness. Perhaps Wisdom would be the only remaining one, or perhaps the Word would remain too, or perhaps the Life, or perhaps the Truth, not the others, which He took for our sake. And <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> indeed are those who in their need for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> have yet become such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as not to need Him in His character as a physician healing the sick, nor in that of a shepherd, nor in that of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, but only in His characters as wisdom, as the word and righteousness, or if there be any other title suitable for those who are so perfect as to receive Him in His fairest characters. So much for the phrase <q>In the beginning.</q></p>

<h2>23. The Title <q>Word</q> Is to Be Interpreted by the Same Method as the Other Titles of Christ. The Word of God is Not a Mere Attribute of God, But a Separate Person. What is Meant When He is Called the Word.</h2>

<p>Let us consider, however, a little more carefully what is the Word which is in the beginning. I am often led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ, even by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him. Though there is a countless number of names which can be applied to our Saviour, they omit the most of them, and if they should remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense, but tropically. But when they come to the title <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> (Word), and repeat that Christ alone is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other titles, search out what is behind the meaning of the term <q>Word.</q> I wonder at the stupidity of the general run of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in this matter. I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity. The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> says in one passage, <q>I am the light of the world,</q> and in another, <q>I am the resurrection,</q> and again, <q>I am the way and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the life.</q> It is also written, <q>I am the door,</q> and we have the saying, <q>I am the good shepherd,</q> and when the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> says, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things,</q> Jesus answers, <q>I that speak unto you am He.</q> Again, when He washed the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> feet, He declared Himself in these words <span class="stiki" id="note094553"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;13:13</a></span> to be their Master and Lord: <q>You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.</q> He also distinctly announces Himself as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, when He says, <span class="stiki" id="note094554"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;10:36</a></span> <q>He whom the Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, You <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>, because I said, I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</q> and <span class="stiki" id="note094555"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;17:1</a></span> <q>Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son, that the Son also may glorify You.</q> We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> question, <span class="stiki" id="note094556"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;18:33,&nbsp;36</a></span> <q>Are  You the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</q> by saying, <q>My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but now is My kingdom not from hence.</q> We have also read the words,  <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> vine and My Father is the husbandman,</q> and again, <q>I am the vine, you are the branches.</q> Add to these testimonies also the saying,  <q>I am the bread of life, that came down from heaven and gives life to the world.</q> These texts will suffice for the present, which we have picked up out of the storehouse of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and in all of which He claims to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says, <span class="stiki" id="note094559"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse18">Revelation&nbsp;1:18</a></span> <q>I am the first and the last, and the living One, and I was dead. Behold, I am alive for evermore.</q> And again, <span class="stiki" id="note094560"><a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse13">Revelation&nbsp;22:13</a></span> <q>I am the <span class="greek">&#x0391;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x03A9;</span>, and the first and the last, the beginning and the end.</q> The careful student of the sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as where He calls Himself <span class="stiki" id="note094561"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;49:2</a></span> a chosen shaft, and a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and a light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note094563"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;49:6</a></span> Isaiah also says,  <q>From my mother's womb has He called me by my name, and He made my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and He said to me, You are My servant, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and in you will I be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> And a little farther on: <q>And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for you to be called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Behold I have set you for a light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that you should be for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the end of the earth.</q> And in Jeremiah too <span class="stiki" id="note094565"><a href="../bible/jer011.htm#verse19">Jeremiah&nbsp;11:19</a></span> He likens Himself to a lamb, as thus: <q>I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.</q> These and other similar sayings He applies to Himself. In addition to these one might collect in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and the Apostles and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> a countless number of titles which are applied to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as the writers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> set forth their own views of what He is, or the Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> proclaim in advance His coming advent and announce the things concerning Him under various names. Thus John calls Him the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, <span class="stiki" id="note094566"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> <q>Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the world,</q> and in these words he declares Him as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note094567"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;1:30-31</a></span> <q>This is He about whom I said, that there comes after me a man who is there before me; for He was before me.</q> And in his <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistle</a> John says that He is a Paraclete for our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as thus:  <q>And if any one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we have a Paraclete with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the righteous,</q> and he adds that He is a propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and similarly <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says He is a propitiation:  <q>Whom God set forth as a propitiation through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in the forbearance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> According to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, too, He is declared to be the wisdom and the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:  <q>Christ the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> It is added that He is also sanctification and redemption: <q>He was made to us of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he says, <q>wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.</q> But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a High-Priest: <span class="stiki" id="note094571"><a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;4:14</a></span> <q>Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, let us hold fast our profession.</q> And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have other names for Him besides these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons <span class="stiki" id="note094572"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;49:10</a></span> says, <q>Judah, your brethren shall extol you; your hands are on the necks of your enemies. A lion's cub is Judah, from a shoot, my son, are you sprung up; you have lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him?</q> We cannot now linger over these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. What may be quoted against this view, viz., <q>A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved;</q> this can better be cleared up on another occasion.  But Isaiah <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Christ to be spoken of under the names of Jacob and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, when he says, <span class="stiki" id="note094573"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;42:1-4</a></span> <q>Jacob is my servant, I will help Him; <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is my elect, my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has accepted Him. He shall declare judgment to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any one hear His voice on the streets. A bruised rod shall He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope.</q> That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, where he quotes from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> and says:  <q>That the saying might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry,</q> etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God: <span class="stiki" id="note094575"><a href="../bible/eze034.htm#verse23">Ezekiel&nbsp;34:23</a></span> <q>I will raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd.</q> For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but Christ. Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower: <span class="stiki" id="note094576"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;11:1-3</a></span> <q>There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of this root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and of might, the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord.</q> And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as follows:  <q>The stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. It is from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.</q> And the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> shows, as also does Luke in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> as follows: <span class="stiki" id="note094578"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;21:42,&nbsp;44</a></span> <q>Have ye never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. Whosoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.</q> And Luke writes in Acts: <span class="stiki" id="note094579"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;4:11</a></span> <q>This is the stone, which was set at naught of you the builders, which has become the head of the corner.</q> And one of the names applied to the Saviour is that which He Himself does not utter, but which John records&mdash;the Word who was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>. And it is worth our while to fix our attention for a moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great names we have mentioned and regard this as the most important one. As to the former titles, they look for any account of them that any one may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently and ask, What is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> when called the Word? The passage they employ most is that in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>,  <q>My heart has produced a good Word;</q> and they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be the utterance of the Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor are they clear about His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. I do not mean that they confuse its qualities, but the fact of His having an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of His own. For no one can understand how that which is said to be <q>Word</q> can be a Son. And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a Son, let them say that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> is a separate being and has an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of His own. We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it suggests and apply it and demonstrate how the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is suitably described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him called the Word. What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a different course. To add to the authority, therefore, of what we have to say on the question, how the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the Word, we must begin with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him. This, we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a digression, but the thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask as to the concepts for which the titles are used; to observe these matters will clear the way for what is coming. And once we have entered upon the theology concerning the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, as we seek with what diligence we can and find the various things that are taught about Him, we shall necessarily understand more about Him not only in His character as the Word, but in His other characters also.</p>

<h2>24. Christ as Light; How He, and How His Disciples are the Light of the World.</h2>

<p>He said, then, that He was the light of the world; and we have to examine, along with this title, those which are parallel to it; and, indeed, are thought by some to be not merely parallel, but identical with it. He is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, and the light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. In the opening of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> now before us He is the light of men: <q>That which was made,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note094581"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3-5</a></span> it says, <q>was life in Him, and the life was the light of men; and the light shines in darkness, and the darkness did not overtake it.</q> A little further on, in the same passage, He is called the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light: <span class="stiki" id="note094582"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;1:9</a></span> <q>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, which lightens every man, was coming into the world.</q> In Isaiah, He is the light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, as we said before. <q>Behold, <span class="stiki" id="note094583"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;49:6</a></span> I have set You for a light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that You should be for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the end of the earth.</q> Now the sensible light of the world is the sun, and after it comes very worthily the moon, and the same title may be applied to the stars; but those lights of the world are said in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to have come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> on the fourth day, and as they shed light on the things on the earth, they are not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light. But the Saviour shines on creatures which have <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and sovereign reason, that their minds may behold their proper objects of vision, and so he is the light of the intellectual world, that is to say, of the reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which are in the sensible world, and if there be any beings beyond these in the world from which He declares Himself to be our Saviour. He is, indeed, the most determining and distinguished part of that world, and, as we may say, the sun who makes the great day of the Lord. In view of this day He says to those who partake of His light, <q>Work <span class="stiki" id="note094584"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;9:4-5</a></span> while it is day; the night comes when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</q> Then He says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,  <q>You are the light of the world,</q> and <q>Let your light shine before men.</q> Thus we see the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the bride, to present an analogy to the moon and stars, and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> have a light, which is their own or borrowed from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sun, so that they are able to illuminate those who have no command of any spring of light in themselves. We may say that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Peter are the light of the world, and that those of their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who are enlightened themselves, but are not able to enlighten others, are the world of which the Apostles were the light. But the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, being the light of the world, illuminates not bodies, but by His incorporeal power the incorporeal <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, to the end that each of us, enlightened as by the sun, may be able to discern the rest of the things of the mind. And as when the sun is shining the moon and the stars lose their power of giving light, so those who are irradiated by Christ and receive His beams have no need of the ministering <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; we must have <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to declare this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash; nor of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; I will add that they have no need even of the greater powers when they are <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of that <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> light. To those who do not receive the solar beams of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the ministering <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> do afford an illumination much less than the former; this illumination is as much as those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can receive, and it completely fills them. Christ, again, the light of the world, is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light as distinguished from the light of sense; nothing that is sensible is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Yet though the sensible is other than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it does not follow that the sensible is false, for the sensible may have an analogy with the intellectual, and not everything that is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> can correctly be called false. Now I ask whether the light of the world is the same thing with the light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and I conceive that a higher power of light is intended by the former phrase than by the latter, for the world in one sense is not only men. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> shows that the world is something more than men when he writes to the Corinthians in his first Epistle: <span class="stiki" id="note094586"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:9</a></span> <q>We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and to men.</q> In one sense, too, it may be considered,  the world is the creation which is being delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose earnest expectation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We also draw attention to the comparison which may be drawn between the statement, <q>I am the light of the world,</q> and the words addressed to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>You are the light of the world.</q> Some suppose that the genuine <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> are greater than other creatures, some seeking the reason of this in the natural growth of these <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, others inferring it from their harder struggle. For those beings which are in flesh and blood have greater labours and a life more full of dangers than those which are in an ethereal body, and the lights of heaven might not, if they had put on bodies of earth, have accomplished this life of ours free from danger and from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Those who incline to this argument may appeal to those texts of Scripture which say the most exalted things about men, and to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is addressed directly to men; not so much is said about the creation, or, as we understand it, about the world. We read, <span class="stiki" id="note094588"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;17:21</a></span> <q>As I and Thou are one, that they also may be one in Us,</q> and  <q>Where I am, there will also My servant be.</q> These sayings, plainly, are about men; while about the creation it is said that it is delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It might be added that not even when it is delivered will it take part in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor will those who hold this view forget that the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature, honouring man above all else, became man, and that it was not any of the constellations existing in the sky, but one of another order, appointed for this purpose and in the service of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that was made to be the Star of the East, whether it was like the other stars or perchance better than they, to be the sign of Him who is the most excellent of all. And if the boasting of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is in their tribulations, since <span class="stiki" id="note094590"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;5:3-5</a></span> <q>tribulation works patience, and patience probation, and probation hope, and hope makes not ashamed,</q> then the afflicted creation cannot have the like patience with man, nor the like probation, nor the like hope, but another degree of these, since <span class="stiki" id="note094591"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;8:20</a></span> <q>the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it, for hope.</q> Now he who shrinks from conferring such great attributes on man will turn to another direction and say that the creature being subjected to vanity groans and suffers greater affliction than those who groan in this tabernacle, for has she not suffered for the utmost extent of time in her service of vanity&mdash; nay, many times as long as man? For why does she do this not willingly, but that it is against her nature to be subject to vanity, and not to have the best arrangement of her life, that which she shall receive when she is set free, when the world is destroyed and released even from the vanity of bodies. Here, however, we may appear to be stretching too far, and aiming at more than the question now before us requires. We may return, therefore, to the point from which we set out, and ask for what reason the Saviour is called the light of the world, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, and the light of men. Now we saw that He is called the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light with reference to the sensible light of the world, and that the light of the world is the same thing as the light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or that we may at least enquire whether they are the same. This discussion is not superfluous. Some students do not take anything at all out of the statement that the Saviour is the Word; and it is important for us to assure ourselves that we are not chargeable with caprice in fixing our attention on that notion. If it admits of being taken in a metaphorical sense we ought not to take it literally.  When we apply the mystical and allegorical method to the expression <q>light of the world</q> and the many analogous terms mentioned above, we should surely do so with this expression also.</p>

<h2>25. Christ as the Resurrection.</h2>

<p>Now He is called the light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light and the light of the word, because He brightens and irradiates the higher parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or, in a word, of all reasonable beings. And similarly it is from and because of the energy with which He causes the old deadness to be put aside and that which is <em>par excellence</em> life to be put on, so that those who have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> received Him rise again from the dead, that He is called the resurrection. And this He does not only at the moment at which a man says, <span class="stiki" id="note094593"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;6:4</a></span> <q>We are buried with Christ through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and have risen again with Him,</q> but much rather when a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, having laid off all about him that belongs to death, walks in the newness of life which belongs to Him, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, while here. We always <span class="stiki" id="note094594"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:10</a></span> <q>carry about in our body the dying of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>,</q> and thus we reap the vast advantage, <q>that the life of the Lord Jesus might be made manifest in our bodies.</q></p>

<h2>26. Christ as the Way.</h2>

<p>But that progress too, which is in wisdom and which is found by those who seek their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in it to do for them what they require both in respect of exposition of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the divine word and in respect of conduct according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> righteousness, it lets us understand how Christ is the way. In this way we have to take nothing with us, <span class="stiki" id="note094595"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;10:10</a></span> neither wallet nor coat; we must travel without even a stick, nor must we have shoes on our feet. For this road is itself sufficient for all the supplies of our journey; and every one who walks on it wants nothing. He is clad with a garment which is fit for one who is setting out in response to an invitation to a wedding; and on this road he cannot meet anything that can annoy him. <q>No one,</q> Solomon says, <span class="stiki" id="note094596"><a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse19">Proverbs&nbsp;30:19</a></span> <q>can find out the way of a serpent upon a rock.</q> I would add, or that of any other beast. Hence there is no need of a staff on this road, on which there is no trace of any hostile creature, and the hardness of which, whence also it is called rock (<em>petra</em>), makes it incapable of harbouring anything hurtful.</p>

<h2>27. Christ as the Truth.</h2>

<p>Further, the Only-begotten is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because He embraces in Himself according to the Father's will the whole reason of all things, and that with perfect clearness, and being the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> communicates to each creature in proportion to its worthiness. And should any one enquire whether all that the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, according to the depth of His riches and His wisdom and His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to our Saviour also, and should he, imagining that he will thereby glorify the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, show that some things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the Father are unknown to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, although He might have had an equal share of the apprehensions of the unbegotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must remind him that it is from His being the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that He is Saviour, and add that if He is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> complete, then there is nothing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must not limp for the want of the things which, according to those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the Father only. Or else let it be shown that some things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to which the name of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not apply, but which are above the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>28. Christ as Life.</h2>

<p>It is clear also that the principle of that life which is pure and unmixed with any other element, resides in Him who is the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of all creation, taking from which those who have a share in Christ live the life which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, while all those who are thought to live apart from this, as they have not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, have not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life either.</p>

<h2>29. Christ as the Door and as the Shepherd.</h2>

<p>But as one cannot be in the Father or with the Father except by ascending from below upwards and coming first to the divinity of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, through which one may be led by the hand and brought to the blessedness of the Father Himself, so the Saviour has the inscription <q>The Door.</q> And as He is a lover of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and approves the impulse of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to better things, even of those who do not hasten to reason (the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>), but like sheep have a weakness and gentleness apart from all accuracy and reason, so He is the Shepherd. For the Lord saves men and beasts,  and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and Juda are sowed with the seed not of men only but also of beasts. <span class="stiki" id="note094598"><a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse27">Jeremiah&nbsp;31:27</a></span> </p>

<h2>30. Christ as Anointed (Christ) and as King.</h2>

<p>In addition to these titles we must consider at the outset of our work that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and we must also consider that of King, and compare these two so as to find out the difference between them. Now it is said in the forty-fourth Psalm,  <q>You have loved righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity, whence You are anointed (Christ) above Your fellows.</q> His loving righteousness and hating iniquity were thus added claims in Him; His anointing was not contemporary with His being nor inherited by Him from the first. Anointing is a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of entering on the kingship, and sometimes also on the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; and must we therefore conclude that the kingship of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is not inherited nor congenital to Him? But how is it conceivable that the First-born of all creation was not a king and became a king afterwards because He loved righteousness, when, moreover, He Himself was righteousness? We cannot fail to see that it is as a man that He is Christ, in respect of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and liable to be troubled and sore vexed, but that He is conceived as king in respect of the divine in Him. I find support for this in the seventy-first Psalm,  which says, <q>Give the king Your judgment, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Your righteousness to the king's Son, to judge Your people in righteousness and Your poor in judgment.</q> This Psalm, though addressed to Solomon, is evidently a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and it is worth while to ask to what king the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> desires judgment to be given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to what king's Son, and what king's righteousness is spoken of. I conceive, then, that what is called the King is the leading nature of the First-born of all creation, to which judgment is given on account of its eminence; and that the man whom He assumed, formed and moulded by that nature, according to righteousness, is the King's Son. I am the more led to think that this is so, because the two beings are here brought together in one sentence, and are spoken of as if they were not two but one. For the Saviour made both one, <span class="stiki" id="note094601"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> that is, He made them according to the prototype of the two which had been made one in Himself before all things. The two I refer to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since each man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is mixed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and each of those who are saved is thus made spiritual. Now as there are some to whom Christ is a shepherd, as we said before, because of their meek and composed nature, though they are less guided by reason; so there are those to whom He is a king, those, namely, who are led in their approach to religion rather by the reasonable part of their nature. And among those who are under a king there are differences; some experience his rule in a more mystic and hidden and more divine way, others in a less perfect fashion. I should say that those who, led by reason, apart from all agencies of sense, have beheld incorporeal things, the things which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaks of as <q>invisible,</q> or <q>not seen,</q> that they are ruled by the leading nature of the Only-begotten, but that those who have only advanced as far as the reason which is conversant with sensible things, and on account of these glorify their Maker, that these also are governed by the Word, by Christ. No offense need be taken at our distinguishing these notions in the Saviour; we draw the same distinctions in His substance.</p>

<h2>31. Christ as Teacher and Master.</h2>

<p>It is plain to all how our Lord is a teacher and an interpreter for those who are striving towards godliness, and on the other hand a master of those servants who have the spirit of bondage to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note094602"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;8:15</a></span> who make progress and hasten towards wisdom, and are found worthy to possess it. For  <q>the servant <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what the master wills,</q> since he is no longer his master, but has become his friend. The Lord Himself teaches this, for He says to hearers who were still servants: <span class="stiki" id="note094604"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;13:13</a></span> <q>You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am,</q> but in another passage, <span class="stiki" id="note094605"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;15:15</a></span> <q>I call you no longer servants, for the servant <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his master, but I call you friends,</q> because <span class="stiki" id="note094606"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;22:28</a></span> <q>you have continued with Me in all My <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>.</q> They, then, who live according to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exacts from those who are not good servants, as we read in Malachi,  <q>If I am a Master, where is My <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>?</q> are servants of a master who is called their Saviour.</p>

<h2>32. Christ as Son.</h2>

<p>None of these testimonies, however, sets forth distinctly the Saviour's exalted birth; but when the words are addressed to Him, <q>You are My Son, this day have I begotten You,</q>  this is spoken to Him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with whom all time is today, for there is no evening with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as I consider, and there is no morning, nothing but time that stretches out, along with His unbeginning and unseen life. The day is today with Him in which the Son was begotten, and thus the beginning of His birth is not found, as neither is the day of it.</p>

<h2>33. Christ the True Vine, and as Bread.</h2>

<p>To what we have said must be added how the Son is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> vine. Those will have no difficulty in apprehending this who understand, in a manner worthy of the prophetic <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the saying:  <q>Wine makes glad the heart of man.</q> For if the heart be the intellectual part, and what rejoices it is the Word most pleasant of all to drink which takes us off <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things, makes us feel ourselves inspired, and intoxicates us with an intoxication which is not irrational but divine, that, I conceive, with which Joseph made his brethren merry, <span class="stiki" id="note094610"><a href="../bible/gen043.htm#verse34">Genesis&nbsp;43:34</a></span> then it is very clear how He who brings wine thus to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> the heart of man is the <em><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></em> vine. He is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> vine, because the grapes He bears are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> are His branches, and they, also, bring forth the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as their fruit. It is somewhat difficult to show the difference between the vine and bread, for He says, not only that He is the vine, but that He is the bread of life. May it be that as bread nourishes and makes strong, and is said to strengthen the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but wine, on the contrary, pleases and rejoices and melts him, so ethical studies, bringing life to him who learns them and reduces them to practice, are the bread of life, but cannot properly be called the fruit of the vine, while secret and mystical speculations, rejoicing the heart and causing those to feel inspired who take them in, delighting in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and who desire not only to be nourished but to be made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, are called the juice of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> vine, because they flow from it.</p>

<h2>34. Christ as the First and the Last; He is Also What Lies Between These.</h2>

<p>Further, we have to ask in what sense He is called in the Apocalypse the First and the Last, and how, in His character as the First, He is not the same as the Alpha and the beginning, while in His character as the Last He is not the same as the Omega and the end. It appears to me, then, that the reasonable  beings which exist are characterized by many forms, and that some of them are the first, some the second, some the third, and so on to the last. To pronounce exactly, however, which is the first, what kind of a being the second is, which may <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> be designated third, and to carry this out to the end of the series, this is not a task for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but transcends our nature. We shall yet venture, such as we are, to stand still a little at this point, and to make some observations on the matter. There are some gods of whom God is god, as we hear in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>,  <q>Thank ye the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods,</q> and  <q>The God of gods has spoken, and called the earth.</q> Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note094613"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;20:2</a></span> <q>is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the dead but of the living.</q> Those gods, then, are living of whom God is god. The Apostle, too, writing to the Corinthians, says: <span class="stiki" id="note094614"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:5</a></span> <q>As there are gods many and lords many,</q> and so we have spoken of these gods as really existing. Now there are, besides the gods of whom God is god, certain others, who are called thrones, and others called dominions, lordships, also, and powers in addition to these. The phrase, <span class="stiki" id="note094615"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse21">Ephesians&nbsp;1:21</a></span> <q>above every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come,</q> leads us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there are yet others besides these which are less familiar to us; one kind of these the Hebrews called Sabai, from which Sabaoth was formed, who is their ruler, and is none other than God. Add to all these the reasonable being who is mortal, man. Now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things made first in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> some race of reasonable beings; this I consider to be those who are called gods, and the second order, let us say, for the present, are the thrones, and the third, undoubtedly, the dominions. And thus we come down in order to the last reasonable race, which, perhaps, cannot be any other than man. The Saviour accordingly became, in a diviner way than <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, all things to all, that He might either gain all or perfect them; it is clear that to men He became a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. As for His becoming man no believer has any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, but as to His becoming an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, we shall find reason for believing it was so, if we observe carefully the appearances and the words of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in some of which the powers of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> seem to belong to Him. In several passages <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> speak in such a way as to suggest this, as when  <q>the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire. And he said, I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and of Isaac and of Jacob.</q> But Isaiah also says: <span class="stiki" id="note094617"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;9:6</a></span> <q>His name is called Angel of Great Counsel.</q> The Saviour, then, is the first and the last, not that He is not what lies between, but the extremities are named to show that He became all things. Consider, however, whether the last is man, or the things said to be under the earth, of which are the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, all of them or some. We must ask, too, about those things which the Saviour became which He speaks of through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David,  <q>And I became as a man without any to help him, free among the dead.</q> His birth from the Virgin and His life so admirably lived showed Him to be more than man, and it was the same among the dead. He was the only free person there, and His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not left in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Thus, then, He is the first and the last. Again, if there be letters of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as such there are, by reading which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> may say they have read what is written on the tablets of heaven, these letters, by which heavenly things are to be read, are the notions, divided into small parts, into <span class="greek">&#x0391;</span> and so on to <span class="greek">&#x03A9;</span>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Again, He is the beginning and the end, but He is this not in all His aspects equally. For He is the beginning, as the Proverbs teach us, inasmuch as He is wisdom; it is written: <q>The Lord founded Me in the beginning of His ways, for His works.</q> In the respect of His being the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> He is not the beginning. <q>The Word was in the beginning.</q> Thus in His aspects one comes first and is the beginning, and there is a second after the beginning, and a third, and so on to the end, as if He had said, I am the beginning. inasmuch as I am wisdom, and the second, perhaps, inasmuch as I am invisible, and the third in that I am life, for <q>what was made was life in Him.</q> One who was qualified to examine and to discern the sense of Scripture might, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, find many members of the series; I cannot say if he could find them all. <q>The beginning and the end</q> is a phrase we usually apply to a thing that is a completed unity; the beginning of a house is its foundation and the end the parapet. We cannot but think of this figure, since Christ is the stone which is the head of the corner, to the great unity of the body of the saved. For Christ the only-begotten Son is all and in all, He is as the beginning in the man He assumed, He is present as the end in the last of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and He is also in those between, or else He is present as the beginning in Adam, as the end in His life on earth, according to the saying: <q>The last <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was made a quickening spirit.</q> This saying harmonizes well with the interpretation we have given of the first and the last.</p>

<h2>35. Christ as the Living and the Dead.</h2>

<p>In what has been said about the first and the last, and about the beginning and the end, we have referred these words at one point to the different forms of reasonable beings, at another to the different conceptions of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Thus we have gained a distinction between the first and the beginning, and between the last and the end, and also the distinctive meaning of <span class="greek">&#x0391;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x03A9;</span> . It is not hard to see why he is called <span class="stiki" id="note094619"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse17">Revelation&nbsp;1:17-18</a></span> <q>the Living and the Dead,</q> and after being dead He that is alive for evermore. For since we were not helped by His original life, sunk as we were in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He came down into our deadness in order that, He having died to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we, <span class="stiki" id="note094620"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:10</a></span> bearing about in our body the dying of Jesus. might then receive that life of His which is for evermore. For those who always carry about in their body the dying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> shall obtain the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> also, manifested in their bodies.</p>

<h2>36. Christ as a Sword.</h2>

<p>The texts of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which we have discussed, are things said by Himself about Himself. Isaiah, however, He said <span class="stiki" id="note094621"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;49:2-3</a></span> that His mouth had been set by His Father as a sharp sword, and that He was hidden under the shadow of His hand, made like to a chosen shaft and kept close in the Father's quiver, called His servant by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. The mouth of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is a sharp sword, for <span class="stiki" id="note094622"><a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse12">Hebrews&nbsp;4:12</a></span> <q>The word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing to the dividing of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.</q> And indeed He came not to bring peace on the earth, that is, to corporeal and sensible things, but a sword, and to cut through, if I may say so, the disastrous friendship of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, committing herself to the spirit which was against the flesh, may enter into friendship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence, according to the prophetic word, He made His mouth as a sword, as a sharp sword. Can any one behold so many wounded by the divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, like her in the Song of Songs, who complained that she was wounded: <span class="stiki" id="note094623"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse5">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:5</a></span> <q>I am wounded with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> and find the dart that wounded so many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in any but Him who said, <q>He has made Me as a chosen shaft.</q></p>

<h2>37. Christ as a Servant, as the Lamb of God, and as the Man Whom John Did Not Know.</h2>

<p>Again, let any one consider how Jesus was to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, not as He who sits at meat, but as He who serves, and how though the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> He took on Him the form of a servant for the sake of the freedom of those who were enslaved in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and he will be at no loss to account for the Father's saying to Him:  <q>You are My servant,</q> and a little further on: <q>It is a great thing that you should be called My servant.</q> For we do not hesitate to say that the goodness of Christ appears in a greater and more divine light, and more according to the image of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because <span class="stiki" id="note094625"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6,&nbsp;8</a></span> <q>He humbled Himself, becoming <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, even the death of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>,</q> than if He had judged it a thing to be grasped to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and had shrunk from becoming a servant for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world. Hence He says, <span class="stiki" id="note094626"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;49:5-6</a></span> desiring to teach us that in accepting this state of servitude He had received a great gift from His Father: <q>And My God shall be My strength. And He said to Me, It is a great thing for You to be called My servant.</q> For if He had not become a servant, He would not have raised up the tribes of Jacob, nor have turned the heart of the diaspora of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and neither would He have become a light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to be for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the ends of the earth. And it is no great thing for Him to become a servant, even if it is called a great thing by His Father, for this is in comparison with His being called with an innocent sheep and with a lamb. For the Lamb of God became like an innocent sheep being led to the slaughter, that He may take away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world. He who supplies reason (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) to all is made like a lamb which is dumb before her shearer, that we might be purified by His death, which is given as a sort of medicine against the opposing power, and also against the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of those who open their minds to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For the death of Christ reduced to impotence those powers which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and it set free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by a power beyond our words the life of each believer. Since, then, He takes away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> until every enemy shall be destroyed and death last of all, in order that the whole world may be free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, therefore John points to Him and says: <span class="stiki" id="note094627"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> <q>Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world.</q> It is not said that He will take it away in the future, nor that He is at present taking it, nor that He has taken it, but is not taking it away now. His taking away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is still going on, He is taking it away from every individual in the world, till <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be taken away from the whole world, and the Saviour deliver the kingdom prepared and completed to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, a kingdom in which no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is left at all, and which, therefore, is ready to accept the Father as its king, and which on the other hand is waiting to receive all God has to bestow, fully, and in every part, at that time when the saying <span class="stiki" id="note094628"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:28</a></span> is fulfilled, <q>That God may be all in all.</q> Further, we hear of a man who is said to be coming after John, who was made before him and was before him. This is to teach us that the man also of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the man who was mixed with His divinity, was older than His birth from Mary. John says he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this man, but must he not have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him when he leapt for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> when yet a babe unborn in <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth's</a> womb, as soon as the voice of Mary's salutation sounded in the ears of the wife of Zacharias? Consider, therefore, if the words <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him not</q> may have reference to the period before the bodily <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Though he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him before He assumed His body, yet he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him when yet in his mother's womb, and perhaps he is here learning something new about Him beyond what was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him before, namely, that on whomsoever the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> shall descend and abide on him, that is he who is to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and with fire. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him from his mother's womb, but not all about Him. He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> perhaps that this is He who baptizes with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and with fire, when he saw the Spirit descending and abiding on Him. Yet that He was indeed a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the first man, John did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</p>

<h2>38. Christ as Paraclete, as Propitiation, and as the Power of God.</h2>

<p>But none of the names we have mentioned expresses His representation of us with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as He pleads for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and makes atonement for it; the Paraclete, and the propitiation, and the atonement. He has the name Paraclete in the Epistle of John: <span class="stiki" id="note094629"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:1-2</a></span> <q>If any man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we have a Paraclete with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the righteous.</q> And He is said in the same epistle to be the atonement for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Similarly, in the Epistle to the Romans, He is called a propitiation:  <q>Whom God set forth to be a propitiation through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> Of this proportion there was a type in the inmost part of the temple, the Holy of Holies, namely, the golden mercy-seat placed upon the two <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>. But how could He ever be the Paraclete, and the atonement, and the propitiation without the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which makes an end of our weakness, flows over the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and is administered by Jesus, who indeed is prior to it and Himself the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who enables a man to say: <span class="stiki" id="note094632"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> <q>I can do all things through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> who strengthens me.</q> Whence we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, who gave himself the title of <q>The power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is called great,</q> was consigned to perdition and destruction, he and his money with him. We, on the contrary, who confess Christ as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we share with Him, inasmuch as He is that power, all things in which any energy resides.</p>

<h2>39. Christ as Wisdom and Sanctification and Redemption.</h2>

<p>We must not, however, pass over in silence that He is of right the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hence is called by that name. For the wisdom of the God and Father of all things does not apprehend His substance in mere visions, like the phantasms of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> thoughts. Whoever is able to conceive a bodiless <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of manifold speculations which extend to the rationale of existing things, living and, as it were, ensouled, he will see how well the Wisdom of God which is above every creature speaks of herself, when she says: <span class="stiki" id="note094633"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;8:22</a></span> <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created me the beginning of His ways, for His works.</q> By this creating act the whole creation was enabled to exist, not being unreceptive of that divine wisdom according to which it was brought into being; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David,  made all things in wisdom. But many things came into being by the help of wisdom, which do not lay hold of that by which they were created: and few things indeed there are which lay hold not only of that wisdom which concerns  themselves, but of that which has to do with many things besides, namely, of Christ who is the whole of wisdom. But each of the sages, in proportion as he embraces wisdom, partakes to that extent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in that He is wisdom; just as every one who is greatly gifted with power, in proportion as he has power, in that proportion also has a share in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, inasmuch as He is power. The same is to be thought about sanctification and redemption; for Jesus Himself is made sanctification to us and redemption. Each of us is sanctified with that sanctification, and redeemed with that redemption. Consider, moreover, if the words <q>to us,</q> added by the Apostle, have any special force. Christ, he says, <q>was made to us of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.</q> In other passages, he speaks about Christ as being wisdom, without any such qualification, and of His being power, saying that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though we might have conceived that He was not the wisdom of God or the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, absolutely, but only for us. Now, in respect of wisdom and power, we have both forms of the statement, the relative and the absolute; but in respect of sanctification and redemption, this is not the case. Consider, therefore, since <span class="stiki" id="note094635"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse11">Hebrews&nbsp;2:11</a></span> <q>He that sanctifies and they that are sanctified are all of one,</q> whether the Father is the sanctification of Him who is our sanctification, as, Christ being our head, God is His head. But Christ is our redemption because we had become prisoners and needed ransoming. I do not enquire as to His own redemption, for though He was tempted in all things as we are, He was without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and His enemies never reduced Him to captivity.</p>

<h2>40. Christ as Righteousness; As the Demiurge, the Agent of the Good God, and as High-Priest.</h2>

<p>Having expiscated the <q>to us</q> and the <q>absolutely</q>&mdash; sanctification and redemption being <q>to us</q> and not absolute, wisdom and redemption both to us and absolute&mdash; we must not omit to enquire into the position of righteousness in the same passage. That Christ is righteousness relatively to us appears clearly from the words: <q>Who was made to us of God wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.</q> And if we do not find Him to be righteousness absolutely as He is the wisdom and the power of God absolutely, then we must enquire whether to Christ Himself, as the Father is sanctification, so the Father is also righteousness. There is, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, no unrighteousness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note094636"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;7:18</a></span> He is a righteous and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note094637"><a href="../bible/rev016.htm#verse5">Revelation&nbsp;16:5,&nbsp;7</a></span> and His judgments are in righteousness, and being righteous, He orders all things righteously.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> drew a distinction for purposes of their own between the just and the good. They did not make the matter very clear, but they considered that the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demiurge</a> was just, while the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. That distinction may, I think, if carefully examined, be applied to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; the Son being righteousness, and having received power <span class="stiki" id="note094638"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;5:27</a></span> to execute judgment, because He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and will judge the world in righteousness, but the Father doing good to those who have been disciplined by the righteousness of the Son. This is after the kingdom of the Son; then the Father will manifest in His works His name the Good, when God becomes all in all. And perhaps by His righteousness the Saviour prepares everything at the fit times, and by His word, by His ordering, by His chastisements, and, if I may use such an expression, by His spiritual healing aids, disposes all things to receive at the end the goodness of the Father. It was from His sense of that goodness that He answered him who addressed the Only-begotten with the words <q>Good Master,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note094639"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse9">Hebrews&nbsp;2:9</a></span> and said, <q>Why do you call Me good? None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but one, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father.</q> This we have treated of elsewhere, especially in dealing with the question of the greater than the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demiurge</a>; Christ we have taken to be the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demiurge</a>, and the Father the greater than He. Such great things, then, He is, the Paraclete, the atonement, the propitiation, the sympathizer with our weaknesses, who was tempted in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things, as we are, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and in consequence He is a great High-Priest, having offered Himself as the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which is offered once for all, and not for men only but for every rational creature. For without  God He tasted death for every one. In some copies of the Epistle to the Hebrews the words are <q>by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Now, whether He tasted death for every one without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He died not for men only but for all other intellectual beings too, or whether He tasted death for every one by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He died for all without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God He tasted death for every one. It would surely be absurd to say that He tasted death for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and not for any other being besides man which had fallen into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as for example for the stars. For not even the stars are clean in the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we read in Job, <span class="stiki" id="note094641"><a href="../bible/job025.htm#verse5">Job&nbsp;25:5</a></span> <q>The stars are not clean in His sight,</q> unless this is to be regarded as a hyperbole. Hence he is a great High-Priest, since He restores all things to His Father's kingdom, and arranges that whatever defects exist in each part of creation shall be filled up so as to be full of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father. This High-Priest is called, from some other notion of him than those we have noticed, Judas, that those who are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> secretly <span class="stiki" id="note094642"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;2:29</a></span> may take the name of Jew not from Judah, son of Jacob, but from Him, since they are His brethren, and praise Him for the freedom they have attained. For it is He who sets them free, saving them from their enemies on whose backs He lays His hand to subdue them. When He has put under His feet the opposing power, and is alone in presence of His Father, then He is Jacob and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and thus as we are made light by Him, since He is the light of the world, so we are made Jacob since He is called Jacob, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> since He is called <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</p>

<h2>41. Christ as the Rod, the Flower, the Stone.</h2>

<p>Now He receives the kingdom from the king whom the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> appointed, beginning the monarchy not at the divine command and without even consulting God. He therefore fights the battles of the Lord and so prepares peace for His Son, His people, and this perhaps is the reason why He is called David. Then He is called a rod; <span class="stiki" id="note094643"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;11:1</a></span> such He is to those who need a harder and severer discipline, and have not submitted to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and gentleness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On this account, if He is a rod, He has to <q>go forth;</q> He does not remain in Himself, but appears to go beyond His earlier state. Going forth, then, and becoming a rod, He does not remain a rod, but after the rod He becomes a flower that rises up, and after being a rod He is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as a flower to those who, by His being a rod, have met with visitation. For <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will visit their iniquities with a rod,</q>  that is, Christ. But <q>His mercy He will not take from him,</q> for He will have mercy on him, for on whom the Son has mercy the Father has mercy also. An interpretation may be given which makes Him a rod and a flower in respect of different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, a rod to those who have need of chastisement, a flower to those who are being saved; but I prefer the account of the matter given above. We must add here, however, that, perhaps, looking to the end, if Christ is a rod to any man He is also a flower to him, while it is not the case that he who receives Him as a flower must also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him as a rod. And yet as one flower is more perfect than another and plants are said to flower, even though they bring forth no perfect fruit, so the perfect receive that of Christ which transcends the flower. Those, on the other hand, who have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him as a rod will partake along with it, not in His perfection, but in the flower which comes before the fruit. Last of all, before we come to the word <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, Christ was a stone,  set at naught by the builders but placed on the head of the corner, for the living stones are built up as on a foundation on the other stones of the Apostles and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, Christ Jesus Himself our Lord being the chief corner-stone, because He is a part of the building made of living stones in the land of the living; therefore He is called a stone. All this we have said to show how capricious and baseless is the procedure of those who, when so many names are given to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, take the mere appellation <q>the Word,</q> without enquiring, as in the case of His other titles, in what sense it is used; surely they ought to ask what is meant when it is said of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> that He was the Word, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that He was in the beginning with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that all things were made by Him.</p>

<h2>42. Of the Various Ways in Which Christ is the Logos.</h2>

<p>As, then, from His activity in enlightening the world whose light He is, Christ is named the Light of the World, and as from His making those who sincerely attach themselves to Him put away their deadness and rise again and put on newness of life, He is called the Resurrection, so from an activity of another kind He is called Shepherd and Teacher, King and Chosen Shaft, and Servant, and in addition to these Paraclete and Atonement and Propitiation. And after the same fashion He is also called the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>,  because He takes away from us all that is irrational, and makes us <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> reasonable, so that we do all things, even to eating and drinking, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and discharge by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God both the commoner functions of life and those which belong to a more advanced stage. For if, by having part in Him, we are raised up and enlightened, herded also it may be and ruled over, then it is clear that we become in a divine manner reasonable, when He drives away from us what in us is irrational and dead, since He is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> (reason) and the Resurrection. Consider, however, whether all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have in some way part in Him in His character as <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>. On this point the Apostle teaches us that He is to be sought not outside the seeker, and that those find Him in themselves who set their heart on doing so; <q>Say not <span class="stiki" id="note094647"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;10:6-8</a></span> in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? That is to bring Christ down; or, Who shall descend into the abyss? That is to bring Christ up from the dead. But what says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>? The Word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart,</q> as if Christ Himself were the same thing as the Word said to be sought after. But when the Lord Himself says <span class="stiki" id="note094648"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;15:22</a></span> <q>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but now they have no cloak for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> the only sense we can find in His words is that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> Himself says that those are not chargeable with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to whom He (reason) has not fully come, but that those, if they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are guilty who, having had part in Him, act contrary to the ideas by which He declares His full presence in us. Only when thus read is the saying <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: <q>If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> Should the words be applied, as many are of opinion that they should, to the visible Christ, then how is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that those had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to whom He did not come? In that case all who lived before the advent of the Saviour will be free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since Jesus, as seen in flesh, had not yet come. And more&mdash; all those to whom He has never been preached will have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and if they have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, then it is clear they are not liable to judgment. But the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> in man, in which we have said that our whole race had part, is spoken of in two senses; first, in that of the filling up of ideas which takes place, prodigies excepted, in every one who passes beyond the age of boyhood, but secondly, in that of the consummation, which takes place only in the perfect. The words, therefore, <q>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but now they have no cloak for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> are to be understood in the former sense; but the words, <span class="stiki" id="note094649"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;10:8</a></span> <q>All that ever came before me are thieves and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and the sheep did not hear them,</q> in the latter. For before the consummation of reason comes, there is nothing in man but what is blameworthy; all is imperfect and defective, and can by no means command the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of those irrational elements in us which are tropically spoken of as sheep. And perhaps the former meaning is to be recognized in the words <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> was made flesh,</q> but the second in <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> was God.</q> We must accordingly look at what there is to be seen in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs between the saying, <q>The Word (reason) was made flesh</q> and <q>The Word was God.</q> When the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a> can we say that it was to some extent broken up and thinned out, and can we say that it recovered from that point onward till it became again what it was at first, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, the Word with the Father; the Word whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> John saw, the verily only-begotten, as from the Father. But the Son may also be the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> (Word), because He reports the secret things of His Father who is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in the same way as the Son who is called the Word. For as with us the word is a messenger of those things which the mind perceives, so the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since no created being can approach Him without a guide, reveals the Father whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. For no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note094650"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> and he to whomsoever the Son reveals Him, and inasmuch as He is the Word He is the Messenger of Great Counsel, <span class="stiki" id="note094651"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;9:5-6</a></span> who has the government upon His shoulders; for He entered on His kingdom by enduring the cross. In the Apocalypse,  moreover, the Faithful and True (the Word), is said to sit on a white horse, the epithets indicating, I consider, the clearness of the voice with which the Word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> speaks to us when He sojourns among us. This is scarcely the place to show how the word <q>horse</q> is often used in passages spoken for our encouragement in sacred learning. I only cite two of these: <q>A horse is deceitful for safety,</q>  and <q>Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the name of the Lord our God.</q>  Nor must we leave unnoticed a passage in the forty-fourth Psalm,  frequently quoted by many writers as if they understood it: <q>My heart has belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King.</q> Suppose it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father who speaks thus; what is His heart, that the good word should appear in accordance with His heart? If, as these writers suppose, the Word (<a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>) needs no interpretation, then the heart is to be taken in the natural sense too. But it is quite absurd to suppose God's heart to be a part of Him as ours is of our body. We must remind such writers that as when the hand of God is spoken of, and His arm and His finger, we do not read the words literally but enquire in what sound sense we may take them so as to be worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so His heart is to be understood of His rational power, by which He disposes all things, and His word of that which announces what is in this heart of His. But who is it that announces the counsel of the Father to those of His creatures who are worthy and who have risen above themselves, who but the Saviour? That <q>belched forth</q> is not, perhaps, without significance; a hundred other terms might have been employed; <q>My heart has produced a good word,</q> it might have been said, or <q>My heart has spoken a good word.</q> But in belching, some wind that was hidden makes its way out to the world, and so it may be that the Father gives out views of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> not continuously, but as it were after the fashion of belching, and the word has the character of the things thus produced, and is called, therefore, the image of the invisible God. We may enter our agreement, therefore, with the ordinary acceptation of these words, and take them to be spoken by the Father. It is not, however, a matter of course, that it is God Himself who announces these things. Why should it not be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>? Filled with the Spirit and unable to contain himself, he brings forth a word about his <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> concerning Christ: <q>My heart has belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King, my pen is the tongue of a ready writer. Excellent in beauty is He beyond the sons of men.</q> Then to the Christ Himself: <q>Grace is poured out on Your lips.</q> If the Father were the speaker, how could He go on after the words, <q>Grace is poured out on your lips,</q> to say, <q>Therefore God has blessed you for ever,</q> and a little further on, <q>Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed you with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above your fellows.</q> Some of those who wish to make the Father the speaker may appeal to the words, <q>Hear, O daughter, and behold and incline your ear, and forget your people and your father.</q> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, it may be said, could not address the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the words, <q>Hear, O daughter.</q> It is not difficult, however, to show that changes of person occur frequently in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, so that these words, <q>Hear, O daughter,</q> might be from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in this passage, though the Psalm as a whole is not. To our discussion of the Word we may here add the passage,  <q>By the word of the Lord were the heavens founded, and all the power of them by the breath of His mouth.</q> Some refer this to the Saviour and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. The passage, however, does not necessarily imply any more than that the heavens were founded by the reason (logos) of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as when we say that a house is built by the plan (logos) of the architect, or a ship by the plan (logos) of the shipbuilder. In the same way the heavens were founded (made solid) by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, for they are  of a more divine substance, which on this account is called solid;  it has little fluidity for the most part, nor is it easily melted like other parts of the world, and specially the lower parts. On account of this difference the heavens are said in a special manner to be constituted by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>.</p>

<p>The saying then stands, first, <q>In the beginning was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>;</q> we are to place that full in our view; but the testimonies we cited from the Proverbs led us to place wisdom first, and to think of wisdom as preceding the Word which announces her. We must observe, then, that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> is in the beginning, that is, in wisdom, always. Its being in wisdom, which is called the beginning, does not prevent it from being with God and from being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it is not simply with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but is in the beginning, in wisdom, with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For he goes on: <q>He was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> He might have said, <q>He was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> but as He was in the beginning, so He was with God in the beginning, and <q>All things were made by Him,</q> being in the beginning, for God made all things, as David tells us, in wisdom. And to let us understand that the Word has His own definite place and sphere as one who has life in Himself (and is a distinct person), we must also speak about powers, not about power. <q>Thus says the Lord of powers, (A.V. hosts)</q> we frequently read; there are certain creatures, rational and divine, which are called powers: and of these Christ was the highest and best, and is called not only the wisdom of God but also His power. As, then, there are several powers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, each of them in its own form, and the Saviour is different from these, so also Christ, even if that which is <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> in us is not in respect of form outside of us, will be understood from our discussion up to this point to be the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, who has His being in the beginning, in wisdom. This for the present may suffice, on the word: <q>In the beginning was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>.</q></p>
