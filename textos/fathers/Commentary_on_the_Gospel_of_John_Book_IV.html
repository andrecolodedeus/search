<h1>Commentary on the Gospel of John (Book IV)</h1>

<p>[<em>Three Leaves from the Beginning</em>.]</p>

<p>1. He who distinguishes in himself voice and meaning and things for which the meaning stands, will not be offended at rudeness of language if, on enquiry, he finds the things spoken of to be sound. The more may this be so when we remember how the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men acknowledge their speech and their preaching to be not in persuasion of the wisdom of words, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power....</p>

<p>[<em>Then, after speaking of the rudeness of style of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, he proceeds</em>:]</p>

<p>2. The Apostles are not unaware that in some things they give offense, and that in some respects their culture is defective, and they confess themselves <span class="stiki" id="note094777"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:6</a></span> accordingly to be rude in speech but not in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for we must consider that the other Apostles would have said this, too, as well as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. As for the text, <span class="stiki" id="note094778"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> <q>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and not of us,</q> we interpret it in this way. By <q>treasures</q> we understand here, as in other passages, the treasure of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (gnosis) and of hidden wisdom. By <q>earthen vessels</q> we understand the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> diction of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, which the Greek might so readily be led to despise, and in which the excellency of God's power appears so clearly. The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the power of the things said were not hindered by the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> diction from travelling to the ends of the earth, nor from subduing to the word of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not only the foolish things of the world, but sometimes its wise things, too. For we see our calling, <span class="stiki" id="note094779"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:26-27</a></span> not that no wise man according to the flesh, but that not many wise according to the flesh. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in his preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, is a debtor <span class="stiki" id="note094780"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;1:14</a></span> to deliver the word not to Barbarians only, but also to Greeks, and not only to the unwise, who would easily agree with him, but also to the wise. For he was made sufficient <span class="stiki" id="note094781"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:6</a></span> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be a minister of the New Covenant, wielding the demonstration of the spirit and of power, so that when the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> agreed with him their belief should not be in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, perhaps, if the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> possessed, like the works the Greeks admire, elegance and command of diction, then it would be open to suppose that not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of them had laid hold of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but that the apparent sequence and splendour of language had carried off the hearers, and had carried them off by guile.</p>
