<h1>Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew (Book XII)</h1>

<h2>1. Concerning Those Who Asked Him to Show Them a Sign from Heaven.</h2>

<p><q> <em>And the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> came, and tempting Him kept asking Him to show them a sign from heaven.</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note095553"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;16:1</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> who disagreed with each other in regard to the most essential truths,&mdash; for the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> champion the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, hoping that there will be a world to come, while the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing after this life in store for a man whether he has been advancing towards <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or has made no effort at all to come out from the mountains of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>&mdash;these, I say, agree that they may tempt Jesus. Now, a similar thing, as Luke has narrated, <span class="stiki" id="note095554"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;23:12</a></span> happened in the case of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, who became friends with one another that they might kill Jesus; for, perhaps, their hostility with one another would have prevented <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> from asking that He should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, in order to please the people, who said, <q>Crucify Him, Crucify Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095555"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;23:21</a></span> and would have influenced <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, who was somewhat inclined against His condemnation, his hostility with <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> giving fresh impulse to the inclination which he previously cherished to release Jesus. But their apparent friendship made <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> stronger in his demand against Jesus with <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, who wished, perhaps, also because of the newly-formed friendship to do something to gratify <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and all the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And often even now you may see in daily life those who hold the most divergent opinions, whether in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of the Greeks or in other systems of thought, appearing to be of one mind that they may scoff at and attack <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in the person of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And from these things I think you may go on by rational argument to consider, whether when forces join in opposition which are in disagreement with one another, as of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> with <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note095556"><a href="../bible/2ki024.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;24:7</a></span> and of Tirhakah, king of the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>, with Sennacherib, <span class="stiki" id="note095557"><a href="../bible/2ki019.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;19:9</a></span> a combination then takes place against Jesus and His people. So perhaps, also, <q>The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers were gathered together,</q>  though not at all before at harmony with one another, that having taken counsel against the Lord and His Christ, they might slay the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Why the Pharisees Asked a Sign from Heaven.</h2>

<p>Now, to this point we have come in our discourse, because of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> coming together unto Jesus, who disagreed in matters relating to the resurrection, but came, as it were, to an agreement for the sake of tempting our Saviour, and asking Him to show them a sign from heaven. For, not satisfied with the wonderful signs shown among the people in the healing of all forms of disease and sickness, and with the rest of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which our Saviour had done in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many, they wished Him to show to them also a sign from heaven. And I conjecture that they suspected that the signs upon earth might possibly not be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for they did not hesitate indeed to say, <q>Jesus casts out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> the prince of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>;</q>  and it seemed to them that a sign from heaven could not spring from <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> or any other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> power. But they erred in regard to both, in regard to signs upon earth as well as to signs from heaven, not being <q>approved money-changers,</q>  nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how to distinguish between the spirits that are working, which kind are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which have revolted from Him. And they ought to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that even many of the portents wrought against <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, though they were not from heaven, were clearly from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the fire which fell from heaven upon the sheep of Job was not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note095561"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse16">Job&nbsp;1:16</a></span> for that fire belonged to the same one as he to whom belonged those who carried off, and made three bands of horsemen against, the cattle of Job. I think, moreover, that in Isaiah&mdash; as if signs could be shown both from the earth and from heaven, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> being from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <q>with all power and signs and lying wonders</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095562"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> those from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one&mdash; it was said to Ahaz, <q>Ask for yourself a sign from the Lord your God in the depth or in the height.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095563"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;7:11</a></span> For, unless there had been some signs in the depth or in the height which were not from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, this would not have been said, <q>Ask for yourself a sign from the Lord your God in the depth or in the height.</q> But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well that such an interpretation of the passage, <q>Ask for yourself a sign from the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> will seem to some one rather forced; but give heed to that which is said by the Apostle about the man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the son of perdition, that, <q>with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceit of unrighteousness,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095564"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:9-10</a></span> he shall be manifested to them that are perishing, imitating all kinds of wonders, to-wit, those of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And as the enchanters and magicians of the Egyptians, as being inferior to the man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the son of perdition, imitated certain powers, both the signs and wonders of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, doing lying wonders so that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> might not be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; so I think the man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will imitate signs and powers. And perhaps, also, the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> suspected these things because of the prophecies concerning Him; but I inquire whether also the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> tempting Him asked Jesus to show them a sign from heaven. For unless we say that they suspected this, how shall we describe their relation to the portents which Jesus wrought, who continued hard-hearted and were not put to shame by the miraculous things that were done? But if any one supposes that we have given an occasion of defence to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, both when they say that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were cast out by Jesus through <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, and when tempting Him, they ask Jesus about a heavenly sign, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we plausibly say that they were drawn away to the end that they might not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of Jesus; but not as to deserve forgiveness; for they did not look to the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which were being fulfilled in the acts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, which an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> power was not at all capable of imitating. But to bring back a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which had gone out, so that it came out of the grave when already stinking and passing the fourth day, <span class="stiki" id="note095565"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;11:39</a></span> was the work of no other than Him who heard the word of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>Let us make man after our image and likeness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095566"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> But also to command the winds and to make the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the sea cease at a word, was the work of no other than Him through whom all things, both the sea itself and the winds, have come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">being</a>. Moreover also as to the teaching which stimulates men to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Creator, in harmony with the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and which checks <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and moulds morals according to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, what else did it indicate to such as were able to see, than that He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> who wrought works so mighty? In respect of which things He said also to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of John, <q>Go your way and tell John what great things ye see and hear; the blind receive their sight,</q> etc. <span class="stiki" id="note095567"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;11:4-5</a></span> </p>

<h2>3. The Answer of Jesus to Their Request.</h2>

<p>Next let us remark in what way, when asked in regard to one sign, that He might show it from heaven, to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> who put the question, He answers and says, <q> <em>An <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there shall be no sign given to it, but the sign of Jonah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a></em>, </q> when also, <q>He left them and departed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095568"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;16:4</a></span> But the sign of Jonah, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to their question, was not merely a sign but also a sign from heaven; so that even to those who tempted Him and sought a sign from heaven He, nevertheless, out of His own great goodness gave the sign. For if, as Jonah passed three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> did in the heart of the earth, and after this rose up from it&mdash;whence but from heaven shall we say that the sign of the resurrection of Christ came? And especially when, at the time of the passion, He became a sign to the robber who obtained favour from Him to enter into the paradise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; after this, I think, descending into Hades to the dead, <q>as free among the dead.</q>  And the Saviour seems to me to conjoin the sign which was to come from Himself with the reason of the sign in regard to Jonah when He says, not merely that a sign like to that is granted by Him but that very sign; for attend to the words, <q>And there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095570"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;16:4</a></span> Accordingly that sign was this sign, because that became indicative of this, so that the elucidation of that sign, which was obscure on the face of it, might be found in the fact that the Saviour suffered, and passed three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. At the same time also we learn the general principle that, if the sign signifies something, each of the signs which are recorded, whether as in actual history, or by way of precept, is indicative of something afterwards fulfilled; as for example, the sign of Jonah going out after three days from the whale's belly was indicative of the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, rising after three days and three nights from the dead; and that which is called <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is the sign of that which is indicated by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the words: <q>We are the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095571"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse3">Philippians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> Seek you also every sign in the Old Scriptures as indicative of some passage in the New Scripture, and that which is named a sign in the New Covenant as indicative of something either in the age about to be, or even in the subsequent generations after that the sign has taken place.</p>

<h2>4. Why Jesus Called Them an Adulterous Generation. The Law as Husband.</h2>

<p>And He called them, indeed, <q>an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> generation,</q> because of the quality arising from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which had been produced in them, for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> evil-doing, but <q>adulterous</q> because that when the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> left that which is figuratively called man, the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or the law, they were debauched by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> and the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For if there are two <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, the law in our members warring against the law of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and the law of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note095572"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;7:23</a></span> we must say that the law of the mind&mdash; that is, the spiritual&mdash; is man, to whom the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as wife, that is, to the man who is law, according to what is written, <q>A wife is married to a man by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095573"><a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse14">Proverbs&nbsp;19:14</a></span> but the other is a paramour of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is subject to it, which also on account of it is called an adulteress. Now that the law is husband of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> clearly exhibits in the Epistle to the Romans, saying, <q>The law has dominion over a man for so long time as he lives; for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that has a husband is bound to the husband while he lives, to the husband who is law,</q>  etc. For consider in these things that the law has dominion over the man so long time as the law lives&mdash;as a husband over a wife. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that has a husband,</q> that is, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> under the law, <q>is bound to the husband while he lives,</q> to the husband who is the law; but if the husband&mdash; that is, the law die&mdash; she is discharged from the law, which is her husband. Now the law dies to him who has gone up to the condition of blessedness, and no longer lives under the law, but acts like to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who, though He became under law for the sake of those under law, that He might gain those under law, <span class="stiki" id="note095575"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:10</a></span> did not continue under law, nor did He leave subject to law those who had been freed by Him; for He led them up along with Himself to the divine citizenship which is above the law, which contains, as for the imperfect and such as are still sinners, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. He then who is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and stands no longer in need of legal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, perhaps when he has become perfect has passed beyond even the spiritual law, and comes to the Word beyond it, who became flesh to those who live in the flesh, but to those who no longer at all <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> after the flesh, He is perceived as being the Word, as  He was God in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and reveals the Father. Three things therefore are to be thought of in connection with this place&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that has a husband, who is under a husband&mdash; the law; and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is an adulteress, to-wit, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which, while her husband, the law, lives, has become joined to another husband, namely, the law of the flesh; and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is married to the brother of the dead husband, to the Word who is alive and dies not, who <q>being raised from the dead dies no more, for death has no more dominion over Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095577"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;6:9</a></span> So far then because of the saying, <q>But if the husband die she is discharged from the law, the husband,</q> and because of this, <q>so then, while her husband lives, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be joined to another man,</q> and because of this, <q>but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress though she be joined to another man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095578"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;7:2-3</a></span> But this very saying, <q>So then while her husband lives, she shall be called an adulteress,</q> we have brought forward, wishing clearly to show why in answer to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> who were tempting Him and asking Him to show them a sign from heaven, He said not only <q>a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> generation,</q> but an <q>adulterous</q> generation. <span class="stiki" id="note095579"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;16:4</a></span> In a general way, then, the law in the members which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the law of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note095580"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;7:23</a></span> as a man who is an adulterer, is an adulterer of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But now also every power that is hostile, which gains the mastery over the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and has intercourse with it, commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her who had a bridegroom given to her by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, the Word. After these things it is written that <q>He left them and departed.</q> For how was the bridegroom&mdash; the Word&mdash; not going to leave the adulterous generation and depart from it?

<p><q> <em>And His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came to the other side and forgot to take loaves.</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note095585"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;16:5</a></span> Since the loaves which they had before they came to the other side were no longer useful to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when they came to the other side, for they needed one kind of loaves before they crossed and a different kind when they crossed,&mdash; on this account, being careless of taking loaves when going to the other side, they forgot to take loaves with them. To the other side then came the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who had passed over from things material to things spiritual, and from things sensible to those which are intellectual.

And we might seasonably apply the saying to those who, along with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> way of life, prefer to live as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, materially, for these do not see nor beware of the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, but, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who forbade it, eat the bread of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>.

And there are many among the heterodox who, because of their unbelief in regard to the resurrection of the dead, are imbued with the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>. Now, while Jesus said these things, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> reasoned, saying not aloud, but in their own hearts, <q>We took no loaves.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095592"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;16:7</a></span> And something like this was what they said, If we had loaves we would not have had to take of the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>; but since, from want of loaves, we run the risk of taking from their leaven, while the Saviour does not wish us to run back to their teaching, therefore He said to us, <q>Take heed and beware of the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095593"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;16:6</a></span> And these things then they reasoned; Jesus, while looking to that which was in their hearts, and hearing the reasons in them, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> overseer of hearts, reproves them because they did not see nor remember the loaves which they received from Him; on account of which, even when they appeared to be in want of loaves, they did not need the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>.</p>

<h2>6. The Meaning of Leaven. Jesus' Knowledge of the Heart.</h2>

<p>Then expounding clearly and representing to them, who were being distracted because of the equivocal meaning of loaf and leaven, in an undisguised fashion, that He was not speaking to them about sensible bread but about the leaven in the teaching, He subjoins, <q> <em>How is it that you do not perceive that I spoke not you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>.</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note095594"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;16:11</a></span> And though He had not laid bare the interpretation, but still continued to use metaphorical language, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> would have understood that the discourse of the Saviour was about the teaching, figuratively called leaven, which the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> were teaching. So long, then, as we have Jesus with us fulfilling the promise which runs, <q>Lo, I am with you always unto the consummation of the age,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095595"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;28:20</a></span> we cannot fast nor be in want of food, so that, because of want of it we should desire to take and eat the forbidden leaven, even from the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>. Now there may sometimes be a time, when He is with us, that we are without food, as is spoken of in the passage above, <q>They continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095596"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;15:32</a></span> but, even though this should happen, being unwilling to send us away <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> lest we faint on the way, He gives thanks over the loaves which were with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and causes us to have the seven baskets over from the seven loaves, as we have recorded. And moreover this also is to be observed, in view of those who think that the divinity of the Saviour is not at all demonstrable from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Matthew, that the fact that, when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were reasoning among themselves and saying, <q>We have no loaves,</q> Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their reasonings and said, <q>Why reason ye among yourselves, O you of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because ye took no loaves,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095597"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;16:8</a></span> was beyond the power of man; for the Lord alone, as Solomon says in the third Book of Kings, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the hearts of men. <span class="stiki" id="note095598"><a href="../bible/1ki008.htm#verse39">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;8:39</a></span> But since the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> understood, when Jesus said, <q>Beware of the leaven,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095599"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;16:6</a></span> that He did not tell them to beware of the loaves but of the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, you will understand that whenever leaven is named it is put figuratively for teaching, whether in the law, or in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which come after the law; and so perhaps leaven is not offered upon the altar; for it is not right that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> should take the form of teaching, but should only be supplications of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But one might inquire, on account of what has been said about <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who came to the other side, if any one who has reached the other side can be reproached as one of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and as not yet understanding nor remembering what was done by Jesus. But it is not difficult, I think, to say to this, that in relation to that which is perfect, on the coming of which <q>that which is in part shall be done away,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095600"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:10</a></span> all our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> here is little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and in regard to that, we who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part do not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nor remember; for we are not able to obtain a memory which is sufficient and able to attain to the magnitude of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the speculations.</p>

<h2>7. Relative Magnitude of Sins of the Heart and Actual Sins.</h2>

<p>But we may also learn from this, that in respect of the reasonings only which we reason within ourselves, we are sometimes convicted and reproached as being of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And I think that just as a man commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in his heart only, though not proceeding altogether to the overt act, so he commits in his heart the rest of the things which are forbidden. As then he who has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in his heart will be punished proportionately to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> of this kind, so also he who has done in his heart any one of the things forbidden, for example, who has stolen in his heart only, or borne false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in his heart only, will not be punished as he who has stolen in fact, or who has completed the very act of false testimony, but only as he who has done such things in his heart. There is also the case of the man who while he did not arrive at the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action, came short of it in spite of his own will. For if, in addition to willing it, he has attempted it, but not carried it out, he will be punished not as one who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in his heart alone but in deed. To questions of this sort one might ask, whether any one commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in his heart, even if he does not do the deed of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, but lacks self-control in heart only. And the like also you will say concerning the rest of things which are deserving of praise. But the passage possibly contains a plausible fallacy which must be cleared away, I think, in this manner: <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> which takes place in the heart is a less <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, than if one were also to add to it the act. But it is impossible that there can be <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in the heart, hindering the chaste action&mdash; unless indeed one brings forward for an illustration of this the case of the virgin who according to the law was violated in solitude; <span class="stiki" id="note095601"><a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse25">Deuteronomy&nbsp;22:25</a></span> for it may be granted that the heart of any one may be most pure,  but that force in a matter of licentiousness has caused the corruption of the body of her who was chaste. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> she seems to me to be altogether chaste in secret heart, but no longer to be pure in body such as she was before the act of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>; but though she is not pure outwardly, is she therefore now also unchaste? I have said these things because of the words, <q>They reasoned among themselves saying, We took no loaves,</q> to which is added, <q>And Jesus perceiving it, said, O you of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, why reason ye among yourselves,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095603"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;16:7-8</a></span> etc.; for it was necessary that investigation should be made in regard to the censure of things in secret and correlatively to the praise of things in secret.</p>

<h2>8. The Leaven Figurative Like the Water Spoken of by Jesus to the Woman of Samaria.</h2>

<p>But I wonder if the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> thought, before the saying was explained to them by Jesus, that their Teacher and Lord was forbidding them to beware of the sensible leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> or the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> as impure, and on this account forbidden, lest they might use that leaven because they had not taken loaves. And we might make a like inquiry in regard to other things; but by-way of illustration the narrative about the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> suffices, <q>Every one that drinks of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095604"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;14:13-14</a></span> For there, also, so far as the mere form of expression  is concerned, the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> would seem to have thought that the Saviour was giving a promise about sensible water, when He said, <q>Whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.</q> And those things then must be figuratively interpreted, and we must examine and compare the water of the spring of Jacob from which the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> drew water with the water of Jesus; and here the like must be done; for perhaps the loaves were not baked, but a kind of raw leaven solely, the teaching, namely, of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>.</p>

<h2>9. Concerning the Question of Jesus in C&aelig;sarea, Who Do Men Say that I Am? Different Conceptions of Jesus.</h2>

<p><q> <em>Now when Jesus came into the parts of C&aelig;sarea Philippi, He asked His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note095605"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;16:13</a></span> Jesus inquires of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>Who do men say that I am,</q> that we may learn from the answer of the Apostles the different conceptions then held among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in regard to our Saviour; and perhaps also that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> might learn to be interested in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what is said by men about them;  because that will be an advantage to them who do it, by cutting off in every way occasions of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> if anything <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is spoken of, and by increasing the incitements to good, if anything good is spoken of. Only, observe how, on account of the different movements of opinion among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> about Jesus, some, under the influence of unsound theories, said that He was John the Baptist, like <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> the tetrarch who said to his servants, <q>This is John the Baptist, he is risen from the dead, and therefore do the powers work in him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095607"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;14:2</a></span> but others that He who was now called Jesus was Elijah, either having been born a second time, or living from that time in the flesh, and appearing at the present time. But those who said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was Jeremiah, and not that Jeremiah was a type of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, were perhaps influenced by what is said in the beginning of Jeremiah about Christ, which was not fulfilled in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> at that time, but was beginning to be fulfilled in Jesus, whom <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> set up over nations and kingdoms to root up, and to break down, and to destroy, and to build up, and to transplant,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095608"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:10</a></span> having made Him to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to whom He proclaimed the word. Moreover also those who said, <q>that he was a certain one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095609"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;16:14</a></span> conceived this opinion concerning Him because of those things which had been said in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as unto them, but which had not been fulfilled in their case. But also the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as worthy of the veil which was upon their heart, held false opinions concerning Jesus; while Peter as not a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> <q>of flesh and blood,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095610"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;16:17</a></span> but as one fit to receive the revelation of the Father in heaven, confessed that He was the Christ. The saying of Peter to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He was Christ, was indeed a great thing, but greater that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not only to be Christ, but also <q>the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095611"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> who had also said through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <q>I live,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095612"><a href="../bible/jer022.htm#verse24">Jeremiah&nbsp;22:24</a></span> and <q>They have forsaken Me the spring of living water;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095613"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse13">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:13</a></span> &mdash; and He is life also, as from the Father the spring of life, who said, <q>I am the Life;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095614"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> and consider carefully, whether, as the spring of the river is not the same thing as the river, the spring of life is not the same as life. And these things we have added because to the saying, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> was subjoined the word <q>living;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095615"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> for it was necessary to set forth something noteworthy in regard to that which is said about God and the Father of all things as living, both in relation to His absolute life, and in relation to those things which participate in it. But since we said that they were under the influence of unsound opinions who declared that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was John the Baptist, or any one of those named, in saying this let us prove that if they had fallen in with Jesus as He was going away to John for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or with John when he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> Jesus, or if they had heard it from any one, they would not have said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was John. But also if they had understood the opinions under the influence of which Jesus said, <q>If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah which is to come,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095616"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;11:14</a></span> and had heard what was said, as men having ears, some would not have said that He was Elijah. And if those who said that He was Jeremiah had perceived that the most of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> took upon themselves certain features that were <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> of Him, they would not have said that He was Jeremiah; and in like manner the others would not have said that He was one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</p>

<p>And perhaps that which <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> answered  and said, <q> <em>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></em>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095617"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> if we say it as Peter, not by flesh and blood revealing it unto us, but by the light from the Father in heaven shining in our heart, we too become as Peter, being pronounced blessed as he was, because that the grounds on which he was pronounced blessed apply also to us, by reason of the fact that flesh and blood have not revealed to us with regard to Jesus that He is Christ, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the Father in heaven, from the very heavens, that our citizenship may be in heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note095618"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;3:20</a></span> revealing to us the revelation which carries up to heaven those who take away every veil from the heart, and receive <q>the spirit of the wisdom and revelation</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note095619"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse17">Ephesians&nbsp;1:17</a></span> And if we too have said like Peter, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> not as if flesh and blood had revealed it unto us, but by light from the Father in heaven having shone in our heart, we become a Peter, and to us there might be said by the Word, <q>You are Peter,</q> etc. <span class="stiki" id="note095620"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> For a rock  is every <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Christ of whom those drank who drank of the spiritual rock which followed them, <span class="stiki" id="note095622"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4</a></span> and upon every such rock is built every word of the church, and the polity in accordance with it; for in each of the perfect, who have the combination of words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and thoughts which fill up the blessedness, is the church built by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>11. The Promise Given to Peter Not Restricted to Him, But Applicable to All Disciples Like Him.</h2>

<p>But if you suppose that upon that one Peter only the whole church is built by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what would you say about John the son of thunder or each one of the Apostles? Shall we otherwise dare to say, that against Peter in particular the gates of Hades shall not prevail, but that they shall prevail against the other Apostles and the perfect? Does not the saying previously made, <q>The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095623"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> hold in regard to all and in the case of each of them? And also the saying, <q>Upon this rock I will build My church</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note095624"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> Are the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> given by the Lord to Peter only, and will no other of the blessed receive them? But if this promise, <q>I will give unto you the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095625"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;16:19</a></span> be common to the others, how shall not all the things previously spoken of, and the things which are subjoined as having been addressed to Peter, be common to them? For in this place these words seem to be addressed as to Peter only, <q>Whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095626"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;16:19</a></span> etc.; but in the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Gospel of John</a> the Saviour having given the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> by breathing upon them said, <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095627"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;20:22</a></span> etc. Many then will say to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> but not all who say this will say it to Him, as not at all having learned it by the revelation of flesh and blood but by the Father in heaven Himself taking away the veil that lay upon their heart, in order that after this <q>with unveiled face reflecting as a mirror the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095628"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:18</a></span> they may speak through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> saying concerning Him, <q>Lord Jesus,</q> and to Him, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095629"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> And if any one says this to Him, not by flesh and blood revealing it unto Him but through the Father in heaven, he will obtain the things that were spoken according to the letter of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to that Peter, but, as the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> teaches, to every one who becomes such as that Peter was. For all bear the surname of <q>rock</q> who are the imitators of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, of the spiritual rock which followed those who are being saved, <span class="stiki" id="note095630"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4</a></span> that they may drink from it the spiritual draught. But these bear the surname of the rock just as Christ does. But also as members of Christ deriving their surname from Him they are called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and from the rock, Peters. And taking occasion from these things you will say that the righteous bear the surname of Christ who is Righteousness, and the wise of Christ who is Wisdom. <span class="stiki" id="note095631"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse30">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:30</a></span> And so in regard to all His other names, you will apply them by way of surname to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; and to all such the saying of the Saviour might be spoken, <q>You are Peter,</q> etc., down to the words, <q>prevail against it.</q> But what is the <q>it</q>? Is it the rock upon which Christ builds the church, or is it the church? For the phrase is ambiguous. Or is it as if the rock and the church were one and the same? This I think to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for neither against the rock on which Christ builds the church, nor against the church will the gates of Hades prevail; just as the way of a serpent upon a rock, according to what is written in the Proverbs,  cannot be found. Now, if the gates of Hades prevail against any one, such an one cannot be a rock upon which Christ builds the church, nor the church built by Jesus upon the rock; for the rock is inaccessible to the serpent, and it is stronger than the gates of Hades which are opposing it, so that because of its strength the gates of Hades do not prevail against it; but the church, as a building of Christ who built His own house wisely upon the rock, <span class="stiki" id="note095633"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;7:24</a></span> is incapable of admitting the gates of Hades which prevail against every man who is outside the rock and the church, but have no power against it.</p>

<h2>12. Every Sin&mdash; Every False Doctrine is a <q>Gate of Hades.</q></h2>

<p>But when we have understood how each of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through which there is a way to Hades  is a gate of Hades, we shall apprehend that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which has <q>spot or wrinkle or any such thing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095635"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians&nbsp;5:27</a></span> and because of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is neither <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nor blameless, is neither a rock upon which Christ builds, nor a church, nor part of a church which Christ builds upon the rock. But if any one wishes to put us  to shame in regard to these things because of the great majority of those of the church who are thought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, it must be said to him not only <q>Many are called, but few chosen;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095637"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;22:14</a></span> but also that which was said by the Saviour to those who come to Him, as it is recorded in Luke in these words, <q>Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in through the narrow door and shall not be able;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095638"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse24">Luke&nbsp;13:24</a></span> and also that which is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Matthew thus, <q>For narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leads unto life, and few be they that find it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095639"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;7:14</a></span> Now, if you attend to the saying, <q>Many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in and shall not be able,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095640"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse24">Luke&nbsp;13:24</a></span> you will understand that this refers to those who boast that they are of the church, but live weakly and contrary to the word. Of those, then, who seek to enter in, those who are not able to enter will not be able to do so, because the gates of Hades prevail against them; but in the case of those against whom the gates of Hades will not prevail, those seeking to enter in will be strong, being able to do all things, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, who strengthens them. <span class="stiki" id="note095641"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> And in like manner each one of those who are the authors of any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> opinion has become the architect of a certain gate of Hades; but those who co-operate with the teaching of the architect of such things are servants and stewards, who are the bond-servants of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doctrine which goes to build up impiety. And though the gates of Hades are many and almost innumerable, no gate of Hades will prevail against the rock or against the church which Christ builds upon it. Notwithstanding, these gates have a certain power by which they gain the mastery over some who do not resist and strive against them; but they are overcome by others who, because they do not turn aside from Him who said, <q>I am the door,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095642"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;10:9</a></span> have rased from their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> all the gates of Hades. And this also we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that as the gates of cities have each their own names, in the same way the gates of Hades might be named after the species of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; so that one gate of Hades is called <q>fornication,</q> through which fornicators go, and another <q>denial,</q> through which the deniers of God go down into Hades. And likewise already each of the heterodox and of those who have begotten any <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095643"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:20</a></span> has built a gate of Hades&mdash; <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> one gate, and <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> another, and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> another.</p>

<h2>13. The <q>Gates of Hades</q> And the <q>Gates of Zion</q> Contrasted.</h2>

<p>In this place, then, the gates of Hades are spoken of; but in the Psalms the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> gives thanks saying, <q>He who lifts me up from the gates of death that I may declare all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion.</q>  And from this we learn that it is never possible for any one to be fit to declare the praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless he has been lifted up from the gates of death, and has come to the gates of Zion. Now the gates of Zion may be conceived as opposed to the gates of death, so that there is one gate of death, dissoluteness, but a gate of Zion, self-control; and so a gate of death, unrighteousness, but a gate of Zion, righteousness, which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> shows forth saying, <q>This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter into it.</q>  And again there is cowardice, a gate of death, but manly <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, a gate of Zion; and want of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, a gate of death, but its opposite, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, a gate of Zion. But to all the gates of the <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095646"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:20</a></span> one gate is opposed, the gate of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is free from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. But consider if, because of the saying, <q>our wrestling is not against flesh and blood,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095647"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> etc., you can say that each power and world-ruler of this darkness, and each one of the <q>spiritual hosts of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in the heavenly places</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095648"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> is a gate of Hades and a gate of death. Let, then, the principalities and powers with which our wrestling is, be called gates of Hades, but the <q>ministering spirits</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095649"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;1:14</a></span> gates of righteousness. But as in the case of the better things many gates are first spoken of, and after the gates, one, in the passage, <q>Open to me the gates of righteousness, I will enter into them, and will make full confession to the Lord,</q> and <q>this is the gate of the Lord, by it the righteous shall enter;</q>  so also in the case of those gates which are opposed, many are the gates of Hades and death, each a power; but over all these the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one himself. And let us take heed in regard to each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as if we were descending into some gate of death if we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but when we are lifted up from the gates of death let us declare all the praises of the Lord in the gates of the daughter of Zion; as, for example, in one gate of the daughter of Zion&mdash; that which is called self-control&mdash; we will declare by our self-control the praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in another which is called righteousness, by righteousness we will declare the praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and, generally, in all things whatsoever of a praiseworthy character with which we are occupied, in these we are at some gate of the daughter of Zion, declaring at each gate some praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But we must make inquiry whether in one of the Twelve  it is said, <q>They <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> him that reproves in the gates, and they loathed the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> word.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095652"><a href="../bible/amo005.htm#verse10">Amos&nbsp;5:10</a></span> Perhaps, then, he who reproves in the gates is of the gates of the daughter of Zion, reproving those who are in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are opposed to this gate, even of the gates of Hades or death. But if you do not so understand the words, <q>They <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> him that reproves in the gates,</q> either the expression <q>in the gates</q> will be held to be superfluous, or investigate how that which is said can be worthy of the prophetic spirit.</p>

<h2>14. In What Sense the <q>Keys</q> Are Given to Peter, and Every Peter. Limitations of This Power.</h2>

<p>And after this let us see in what sense it is said to Peter, and to every Peter, <q> <em>I will give unto you the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note095653"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;16:19</a></span> And, in the first place, I think that the saying, <q>I will give unto you the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>,</q> is spoken in consistency with the words, <q>The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095654"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> For he is worthy to receive from the same Word the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, who is fortified against the gates of Hades so that they do not prevail against him, receiving, as it were, for a prize, the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, because the gates of Hades had no power against him, that he might open for himself the gates that were closed to those who had been conquered by the gates of Hades. And he enters in, as a temperate man, through an opened gate&mdash; the gate of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>&mdash; by the key which opens <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>; and, as a righteous man, by another gate&mdash; the gate of righteousness&mdash; which is opened by the key of righteousness; and so with the rest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For I think that for every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> certain <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of wisdom corresponding to the species of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are opened up to him who has lived according to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; the Saviour giving to those who are not mastered by the gates of Hades as many keys as there are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which open gates equal in number, which correspond to each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> according to the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. And perhaps, also, each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and all together are a kingdom of the heavens; so that according to this he is already in the kingdom of the heavens who lives according to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, so that according to this the saying, <q>Repent, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand,</q>  is to be referred, not to the time, but to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and dispositions; for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, has come, and speaks, and on account of this the kingdom of God is within His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and not here or there. <span class="stiki" id="note095656"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;17:21</a></span> But consider how great power the rock has upon which the church is built by Christ, and how great power every one has who says, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> so that the judgments of this man abide sure, as if God were judging in him, that in the very act of judging the gates of Hades shall not prevail against him. But when one judges unrighteously, and does not bind upon earth according to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, nor loose upon earth according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the gates of Hades prevail against him; but, in the case of any one against whom the gates of Hades do not prevail, this man judges righteously. Wherefore he has the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, opening to those who have been loosed on earth that they may be also loosed in heaven, and free; and shutting to those who by his just judgment have been bound on earth that they also may be bound in heaven, and condemned. But when those who maintain the function of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> make use of this word as Peter, and, having received the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, teach that things bound by them, that is to say, condemned, are also bound in heaven, and that those which have obtained remission by them are also loosed in heaven, we must say that they speak wholesomely if they have the way of life on account of which it was said to that Peter, <q>You are Peter;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095657"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> and if they are such that upon them the church is built by Christ, and to them with good reason this could be referred; and the gates of Hades ought not to prevail against him when he wishes to bind and loose. But if he is tightly bound with the cords of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note095658"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;5:22</a></span> to no purpose does he bind and loose. And perhaps you can say that in the heavens which are in the wise man&mdash; that, is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>&mdash;the bad man is bound; and again in these the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> man is loosed, and has received an indemnity for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he committed before his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But, as the man, who has not the cords of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> nor iniquities compared to a <q>long rope or to the strap of the yoke of a heifer,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095659"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;5:18</a></span> not even God could bind, in like manner, no Peter, whoever he may be; and if any one who is not a Peter, and does not possess the things here spoken of, imagines as a Peter that he will so bind on earth that the things bound are bound in heaven, and will so loose on earth that the things loosed are loosed in heaven, he is puffed up, not understanding the meaning of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and, being puffed up, has fallen into the ruin of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note095660"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:10</a></span> </p>

<h2>15. Relation of the Former Commission Given by Jesus to the Disciples, to His Present Injunction of Silence. Belief and Knowledge Contrasted.</h2>

<p><q> <em>Then enjoined He His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that they should tell no man that He was the Christ.</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note095661"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;16:20</a></span> It is written above that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> sent forth these twelve saying unto them, <q>Go not into any way of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095662"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;10:5</a></span> and the other words which are recorded to have been said to them when He sent them to the apostleship. Did He then wish them when they were already discharging the function of Apostles to proclaim that He was the Christ? For, if He wished it, it is fitting to inquire why He now at all commands the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that they should not say that He was the Christ? Or if He did not wish it, how can the things concerning the apostleship be safely maintained? And these things also one may inquire at this place&mdash;whether, when He sent away the Twelve, He did not send them away with the understanding that He was the Christ? But if the Twelve had such understanding, manifestly Peter had it also; how, then, is he now pronounced blessed? For the expression here plainly indicates that now for the first time Peter confessed that Christ was the Son of the living God. Matthew then, according to some of the manuscripts, has written, <q>Then He commanded His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that they should tell no man that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> but <span class="stiki" id="note095663"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;16:20</a></span> Mark says, <q>He charged them that they should tell no man of Him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095664"><a href="../bible/mar008.htm#verse30">Mark&nbsp;8:30</a></span> and Luke, <q>He charged them and commanded them to tell this to no man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095665"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;9:21</a></span> But what is the <q>this</q>? Was it that also according to him, Peter answered and said to the question, <q>Who say ye that I am.</q>&mdash; <q>The Christ, the Son of the living God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095666"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;16:15-16</a></span> You must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, that some manuscripts of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew have, <q>He charged.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095667"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;16:20</a></span> The difficulty thus started seems to me a very real difficulty; but let a solution which cannot be impugned be sought out, and let the finder of it bring it forward before all, if it be more credible than that which shall be advanced by us as a fairly temperate view.  Consider, then, if you can say, that the belief that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ is inferior to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. And perhaps also there is a difference in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, as every one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him alike. From the words in John, <q>If you abide in My word, you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall make you free,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095669"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;8:31-32</a></span> it is plain that belief without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is inferior to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>; but that there is a difference in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, as all who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him equally, is a fact self-evident to any one who gives even a very little consideration to the matter. For who would not acknowledge, for example, that Timothy, though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, had not been enlightened to such an extent in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him as the Apostle had been enlightened? And who would not also admit this&mdash; that though many, speaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, say about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>He has given to me a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things that are,</q> yet they will not say this with equal insight and apprehension of the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, nor as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the same number of things? But it is not only in respect of the difference of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> alike, but also according to that which is the source of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; so that according to this he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son by the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note095670"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> as Peter is testified to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, has the highest beatitude. Now, if these views of ours are sound, you will consider whether the Twelve formerly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> but did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but, after believing, they gained also the rudiments of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> a few things about Him; and afterwards they continued to advance in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> so that they were able to receive the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from the Father who reveals the Son; in which position Peter was, when he was pronounced blessed; for also he is pronounced blessed not merely because he said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> but with the addition, <q>the Son of the living God.</q> Accordingly Mark and Luke who have recorded that Peter answered and said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> but have not given the addition found in Matthew, have not recorded that he was declared blessed for what had been said, nor the blessing which followed the declaration of blessedness, <q>You are Peter,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095671"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> etc.</p>

<h2>16. Gradual Growth in Knowledge of the Disciples.</h2>

<p>But now we must first investigate the fact that they were declaring other things about Him as being great and wonderful, but did not yet proclaim that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, lest the Saviour may not appear to take away from them the authority to announce that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, which He had formerly bestowed upon them. And perhaps some one will support an argument of this kind, saying that on their introduction into the school of Christ the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were taught by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> things about Jesus, so that in due season there might be built upon these as a foundation the things about Jesus being the Christ; and perhaps many of the things which were said to them were said to all who virtually <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; for not to the Apostles alone did the saying apply, <q>Before governors and kings also shall you be brought for My sake for a testimony to them and to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095672"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;10:18</a></span> and perhaps also not to the Apostles absolutely, but to all who were about to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the word, <q>And brother shall deliver up brother to death,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095673"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;10:21</a></span> etc.; but, <q>Whosoever shall confess Me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095674"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;10:32</a></span> etc., is said not specially to the Apostles, but also to all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. According to this, then, through that which was said to the Apostles an outline was given beforehand of the teaching which would afterwards come to be of service both to them and to every teacher.</p>

<h2>17. Reasons for that Gradual Knowledge.</h2>

<p>And likewise he who holds that the fact that He was Christ had been formerly proclaimed by the Apostles when they heard the saying, <q>What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light, and what ye hear in the ear proclaim on the housetops,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095675"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;10:27</a></span> will say, that He wished first to give <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction as it were to those of the Apostles who were to hear the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then to permit this, so to speak, to be digested in the minds of the hearers, that, after there had been a period of silence in the proclamation of something of this kind about Him, at a more seasonable time there might be built up upon the former rudiments <q>Christ Jesus crucified and raised from the dead,</q> which at the beginning not even the Apostles <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>; for it is written in the passage now under consideration, <q>From that time began Jesus to show unto His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that He must go unto Jerusalem</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095676"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;16:21</a></span> and suffer this and that. But if now, for the first time, the Apostles learn from Jesus the things that were about to happen unto Him, namely, that the elders will plot against Him, and that He will be killed, and that after these things, on the third day, He will rise from the dead&mdash;what necessity is there for supposing that those who had been taught by the Apostles concerning Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them before, or that although Christ was announced to them He was announced to them by way of an introduction which did not clearly elucidate the things concerning Him? For our Saviour wished, when He enjoined the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to tell no man that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, to reserve the more perfect teaching about Him to a more fitting time, when to those who had seen Him crucified, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who had seen Him crucified and risen could testify the things relating to His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. For if the Apostles, who were always with Him and had seen all the wonderful things which He did, and who bore testimony to His words that they were words of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, <span class="stiki" id="note095677"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse68">John&nbsp;6:68</a></span> were offended on the night on which He was betrayed&mdash;what do you suppose would have been the feelings of those who had formerly learned that He was the Christ? To spare them, I think, He gave this command.</p>

<h2>18. Jesus Was at First Proclaimed by the Twelve as a Worker and a Teacher Only.</h2>

<p>But he who holds that the things spoken to the Twelve refer to the times subsequent to this, and that the Apostles had not as yet announced to their hearers that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, will say that He wished the conception of the Christ which was involved in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to be reserved for that preaching which was more perfect, and which brought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of when he said to the Corinthians, <q>I determined not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything among you save <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and Him crucified.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095678"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> Wherefore, formerly they proclaimed Jesus as the doer of certain things, and the teacher of certain things; but now when Peter confesses that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as He did not wish it to be proclaimed already that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, in order that He might be proclaimed at a more suitable time, and that as crucified, He commands His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that they should tell no man that He was the Christ. And that this was His meaning, when He forbade proclamation to be made that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, is in a measure established by the words, <q>From that time began Jesus to show unto His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> how that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders,</q> and what is annexed; <span class="stiki" id="note095679"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;16:21</a></span> for then, at the fitting time, He proclaims, so to speak, to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was Christ, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father having revealed it to them, that instead of believing in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> who had been crucified, they were to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> who was about to be crucified. But also, instead of believing in Christ Jesus and Him risen from the dead, He teaches them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ Jesus and Him about to be risen from the dead. But since <q>having put off from Himself the principalities and the powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over in the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095680"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> if any one is ashamed of the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is ashamed of the dispensation on account of which these powers were triumphed over; and it is fitting that he, who both believes and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> these things, should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note095681"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> through which, when Christ was crucified, the principalities&mdash; among which, I think, was also the prince of this world&mdash; were made a show of and triumphed over before the believing world. Wherefore, when His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> was at hand he said, <q>Now the prince of this world has been judged,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095682"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;16:11</a></span> and, <q>Now shall the prince of this world be cast out,</q> and, <q>I, if I be lifted from the earth, will draw all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> unto Myself;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095683"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;12:31-32</a></span> as he no longer had sufficient power to prevent those going to Jesus who were being drawn by Him.</p>

<h2>19. Importance of the Proclamation of Jesus as the Crucified.</h2>

<p>It is necessary, therefore, to the proclamation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as Christ, that He should be proclaimed as crucified; and the proclamation that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the Christ does not seem to me so defective when any of His other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> is passed over in silence, as when the fact of His crucifixion is passed over. Wherefore, reserving the more perfect proclamation of the things concerning Him by the Apostles, He commanded His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that they should tell no man that He was the Christ; and He prepared them to say that He was the Christ crucified and risen from the dead, <q>when He began</q> not only to say, nor even to advance to the point of teaching merely, but <q>to show</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095684"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;16:21</a></span> to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that He must go to Jerusalem, etc.; for attend to the expression <q>show</q>; because just as sensible things are said to be shown so the things spoken by Him to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> are said to be shown by Jesus. And I do not think that each of the things seen was shown to those who saw Him suffering many things in body from the elders of the people, with such clearness as was the rational demonstration about Him to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</p>

<h2>20. Why Jesus Had to Go to Jerusalem.</h2>

<p> <em><q>Then began He to show;</q></em> <span class="stiki" id="note095685"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;16:21</a></span> and probably afterwards when they were able to receive it He showed more clearly, no longer beginning to show as to those who were learning the introduction, but already also advancing in the showing; and if it is reasonable to conceive that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> altogether completed what He began, then, some time, He altogether completed that which He began to show to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> about the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> the things which are written. For, when any one apprehends from the Word the perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these things, then it must be said that, from a rational exhibition (the mind seeing the things which are shown,) the exhibition becomes complete for him who has the will and the power to contemplate these things, and does contemplate them. But since <q>it cannot be that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> perish out of Jerusalem,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095686"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;13:33</a></span> &mdash; a perishing which corresponds to the words, <q>He that loses his life for My sake shall find it,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095687"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;10:39</a></span> &mdash; on this account it was necessary for Him to go to Jerusalem, that having suffered many things in that Jerusalem, He might make <q>the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note095688"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:20</a></span> of the resurrection from the dead in the Jerusalem above, doing away with and breaking up the city upon the earth with all the worship which was maintained in it. For so long as Christ <q>had not been raised from the dead, the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of them that are asleep,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095689"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:20</a></span> and those who become conformed to His death and resurrection had not yet been raised along with Him, the city of God was sought for below, and the temple, and the purifications, and the rest; but when this took place, no longer were the things below sought for, but the things above; and, in order that these might be set up, it was necessary that He should go unto the Jerusalem below, and there suffer many things from the elders in it, and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> of the people, in order that He might be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the heavenly elders who could receive his bounties, and by diviner high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are ordained under the one High-Priest, and that He might be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> of the people who are occupied with letters <q>not written with ink</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095690"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> but made clear by the Spirit of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and might be killed in the Jerusalem below, and having risen from the dead might reign in Mount Zion, and the city of the living God&mdash; the heavenly Jerusalem. <span class="stiki" id="note095691"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse22">Hebrews&nbsp;12:22</a></span> But on the third day He rose from the dead,  in order that having delivered them from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one, and his son,  in whom was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> and unrighteousness and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and everything opposed to that which Christ is, and also from the profane spirit who transforms himself into the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, He might gain for those who had been delivered the right to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in spirit and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, into the name of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which represent the three days <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> present at the same time to those who by means of them are sons of light.</p>

<h2>21. The Rebuke of Peter and the Answer of Jesus.</h2>

<h2>22. Importance of the Expressions <q>Behind</q> And <q>Turned.</q></h2>

<p>But you will compare together His saying to Peter, <q>Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095701"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;16:23</a></span> with that said to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> (who said to Him, <q>All these things will I give You if You will fall down and worship me</q>), <span class="stiki" id="note095702"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;4:9</a></span> <q>get you hence,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095703"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;4:10</a></span> without the addition, <q>behind Me;</q> for to be behind Jesus is a good thing. Wherefore it was said, <q>Come ye behind Me and I will make you fishers of men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095704"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;4:19</a></span> And to the same effect is the saying, <q>He that does not take his cross and follow behind Me is not worthy of Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095705"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;10:38</a></span> And as a general principle observe the expression <q>behind</q>; because it is a good thing when any one goes behind the Lord God and is behind the Christ; but it is the opposite when any one casts the words of God behind him, or when he transgresses the commandment which says, <q>Do not walk behind your <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095706"><a href="../bible/sir018.htm#verse30">Sirach&nbsp;18:30</a></span> And Elijah also, in the third Book of Kings, says to the people, <q>How long halt ye on both your knees?

And if therefore you will collect more illustrations of the <q>having turned,</q> and especially those which are ascribed to Jesus, and compare them with one another, you would find that the expression is not superfluous. But it is sufficient at present to bring forward this from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John, <q>Jesus turned and beheld them</q>&mdash; clearly, Peter and Andrew&mdash; <q>following, and says unto them, What do you seek?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095708"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;1:38</a></span> For observe that, when He <q>turned,</q> it is for the advantage of those to whom He turned.</p>

<h2>23. Peter as a Stumbling-Block to Jesus.</h2>

<p>Next we must inquire how He said to Peter, <q>You are a stumbling-block unto Me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095709"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;16:23</a></span> especially when David says, <q>Great peace have they that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Your law, and there is no stumbling-block to them.</q>  For some one will say, if this is said in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, because of the steadfastness of those who have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and are incapable of being offended, for <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> bears all things, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> all things, hopes all things, endures all things, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> never fails,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095711"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:7-8</a></span> how did the Lord Himself, <q>who upholds all that fall, and raises up all that be bowed down,</q>  say to Peter, <q>You are a stumbling-block unto Me</q>? But it must be said that not only the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, but also he who is perfected in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, cannot be offended. But, so far as it depends on himself, he who says or does such things is a stumbling-block even to him who will not be offended; unless perhaps Jesus calls the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> a stumbling-block even to Himself, as much more than <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> He would have said from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <q>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I burn not?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095713"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> In harmony with which we may put, <q>Who is made to stumble, and I am not made to stumble?</q> But if Peter, at that time because of the saying, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be propitious to You, Lord, this shall not be unto You,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095714"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;16:22</a></span> was called a stumbling-block by Jesus, as not minding the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in what he said but the things of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, what is to be said about all those who profess to be made <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, but do not mind the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and do not look to things unseen and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but mind the things of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and look to things seen and temporal, <span class="stiki" id="note095715"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:18</a></span> but that such still more would be stigmatized by Jesus as a stumbling-block to Him, and because stumbling-blocks to Him, as stumbling-blocks to His brethren also? As in regard to them He says, <q>I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095716"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;25:42</a></span> etc., so also He might say, <q>When I was running ye caused Me to stumble.</q> Let us not therefore suppose that it is a trivial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to mind the things of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, since we ought in everything to mind the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And it will be appropriate also to say this to every one that has fallen away from the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the words of the church and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> mind; as, for example, to him who minds as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> the teaching of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, or <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, or any one of those who teach the things of men as the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>24. Self-Denial and Cross-Bearing.</h2>

<p><q> <em>Then Jesus said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, If any man wills to follow after Me</em>,</q> etc. <span class="stiki" id="note095717"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;16:24</a></span> He shows by these words that, to will to come after Jesus and to follow Him, springs from no ordinary manly <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and that no one who has not denied himself can come after Jesus. And the man denies himself who wipes out by a striking revolution his own former life which had been spent in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; as by way of illustration he who was once licentious denies his licentious self, having become self-controlled even abidingly. But it is probable that some one may put the objection, whether as he denied himself so he also confesses himself, when he denied himself, the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and confesses himself, the righteous one. But, if Christ is righteousness, he who has received righteousness confesses not himself but Christ; so also he who has found wisdom, by the very possession of wisdom, confesses Christ. And such a one indeed as, <q>with the heart believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth makes confession unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095718"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;10:10</a></span> and bears testimony to the works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as making confession by all these things of Christ before men, will be confessed by Him before His Father in heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note095719"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;10:32</a></span> So also he who has not denied himself but denied the Christ will experience the saying, <q>I also will deny him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095720"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;10:33</a></span> On this account let every thought and every purpose and every word and every action become a denial of ourselves, but a testimony about Christ and in Christ; for I am persuaded that every action of the perfect man is a testimony to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, and that abstinence from every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a denial of self, leading him after Christ. And such an one is crucified with Christ, and taking up his own cross follows Him who for our sakes bears His own cross, according to that which is said in John: <q>They took Jesus therefore and put it on Him,</q> etc., down to the words, <q>Where they crucified Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095721"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;19:17-18</a></span> But the Jesus according to John, so to speak, bears the cross for Himself, and bearing it went out; but the Jesus according to Matthew and Mark and Luke, does not bear it for Himself, for Simon of Cyrene bears it.  And perhaps this man refers to us, who because of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> take up the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, but Jesus Himself takes it upon Himself; for there are, as it were, two conceptions of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, the one which Simon of Cyrene bears, and the other which Jesus Himself bears for Himself.</p>

<h2>25. Reference to the Saying of Paul About Crucifixion with Christ.</h2>

<p>Moreover in regard to the saying, <q>Let him deny himself,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095723"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;16:24</a></span> the following saying of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who denied himself seems appropriate, <q>Yet I live, and yet no longer I but Christ lives in me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095724"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> for the expression, <q>I live, yet no longer I,</q> was the voice of one denying himself, as of one who had laid aside his own life and taken on himself the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, in order that He might live in him as Righteousness, and as Wisdom, and as Sanctification, and as our Peace,  and as the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who works all things in him. But further also, attend to this, that while there are many forms of dying, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was crucified, being hanged on a tree, in order that all who die unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may die to it, in no other way than by the way of the cross. Wherefore they will say, <q>I have been crucified with Christ,</q> and, <q>Far be it from me to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> save in the cross of the Lord, through which the world has been crucified unto me and I unto the world.</q>  For perhaps also each of those who have been crucified with Christ puts off from himself the principalities and the powers, and makes a show of them and triumphs over them in the cross; <span class="stiki" id="note095727"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> or rather, Christ does these things in them.</p>

<h2>26. The Less of Life; And the Saving of It.</h2>

<p><q> <em>For whosoever would save his own life shall lose it.</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note095728"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;16:25</a></span> The first expression is ambiguous; for it may be understood in one way thus. If any one as being a lover of life, and thinking that the present life is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, tends carefully his own life with a view to living in the flesh, being afraid to die, as through death going to lose it, this man, by the very willing to save in this way his own life will lose it, placing it outside of the borders of blessedness. But if any one despising the present life because of my word, which has persuaded him to strive in regard to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life even unto death for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, loses his own life, surrendering it for the sake of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to that which is commonly called death, this man, as for my sake he has lost his life, will save it rather, and keep it in possession. And according to a second way we might interpret the saying as follows. If any one, who has grasped what <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> really is, wishes to procure the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his own life, let this man having taken farewell of this life, and denied himself and taken up his own cross, and following me, lose his own life to the world; for having lost it for my sake and for the sake of all my teaching, he will gain the end of loss of this kind&mdash; <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<h2>27. Life Lost to the World is Saved.</h2>

<p>But at the same time also observe that at the beginning it is said, <q>Whosoever wills,</q> but afterwards, <q>Whoso shall lose.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095729"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;16:25</a></span> If we then wish it to be saved let us lose it to the world, as those who have been crucified with Christ and have for our glorying that which is in the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through which the world is to be crucified unto us and we unto the world, <span class="stiki" id="note095730"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> that we may gain our end, even the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of our lives, which begins from the time when we lose it for the sake of the word. But if we think that the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of our life is a blessed thing, with reference to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which is in God and the blessednesses with Him, then any loss of life ought to be a good thing, and, for the sake of Christ must prove to be the prelude to the blessed <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. It seems to me, therefore, following the analogy of self-denial, according to what has been said, that each ought to lose his own life. Let each one therefore lose his own sinning life, that having lost that which is sinful, he may receive that which is saved by right actions; but a man will in no way be profited if he shall gain the whole world. Now he gains the world, I think, to whom the world is not crucified; and to whom the world is not crucified, to that man shall be the loss of his own life. But when two things are put before us, either by gaining one's life to forfeit the world, or by gaining the world to forfeit one's life, much more desirable is the choice, that we should forfeit the world and gain our life by losing it on account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>28. The Exchange for One's Life.</h2>

<p>But the saying, <q> <em>What shall a man give in exchange for his own life</em>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095731"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;16:26</a></span> if spoken by way of interrogation, will seem to be able to indicate that an exchange for his own life is given by the man who after his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> has given up his whole substance, that his property may feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, as if he were going by that to obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; but, if spoken affirmatively, I think, to indicate that there is not anything in man by the giving of which in exchange for his own life which has been overcome by death, he will ransom it out of its hand. A man, therefore, could not give anything as an exchange for his own life, but God gave an exchange for the life of us all, <q>the precious blood of Christ Jesus,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095732"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:19</a></span> according as <q>we were bought with a price,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095733"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:20</a></span> <q>having been redeemed, not with corruptible things as silver or gold, but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,</q> even of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note095734"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:18-19</a></span> And in Isaiah it is said to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <q>I gave <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> in exchange for you, and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Syene for you; from what time you have become <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> before Me you were <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095735"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;43:3-4</a></span> For the exchange, for example, of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of the Egyptians, and the exchange for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was the Egyptians who died in the last plagues that came upon <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and in the drowning which took place after the plagues. But, from these things, let him who is able inquire whether the exchange of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>who redeems <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from all his transgressions,</q>  is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, and, so to speak, spiritual <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and Syene of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and to inquire with more boldness, perhaps Syene is the exchange for Jerusalem, and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> for Jud&aelig;a, and <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> for those who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, who are different from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the house of Levi, and the house of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>.</p>

<h2>30. The Word Appears in Different Forms; The Time of His Coming in Glory.</h2>

<p>But if you will understand the differences of the Word which by <q>the foolishness of preaching</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095744"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:21</a></span> is proclaimed to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and spoken in wisdom to them that are perfect, you will see in what way the Word has the form of a slave to those who are learning the rudiments, so that they say, <q>We saw Him and He had no form or beauty.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095745"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;53:2</a></span> But to the perfect He comes <q>in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His own Father,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095746"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;16:27</a></span> who might say, <q>and we beheld His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as of the only-begotten from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095747"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> For indeed to the perfect appears the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Word, and the only-begotten of God His Father, and the fullness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and likewise of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which that man cannot perceive who requires the <q>foolishness of the preaching,</q> in order to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. But <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall come in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His own Father</q> not alone, but <q>with His own <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> And if you can conceive of all those who are fellow-helpers in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Word, and in the revelation of the Wisdom which is Christ, coming along with Him, you will see in what way the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> comes in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His own Father with His own <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And consider whether you can in this connection say that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who formerly suffered in virtue of their word having <q>no form or beauty</q> had an analogous position to the Word who had <q>no form or beauty.</q> And, as the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> comes in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His own Father, so the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are the words in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, are present with Him preserving the measure of their own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But when the Word comes in such form with His own <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, He will give to each a part of His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and of the brightness of His own <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to the action of each. But we say these things not rejecting even the second coming of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> understood in its simpler form. But when shall these things happen? Shall it be when that apostolic oracle is fulfilled which says, <q>For we must all stand before the judgment-seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether it be good or bad?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095748"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:10</a></span> But if He will render to each according to his deed, not the good deed only, nor the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> apart from the good, it is manifest that He will render to each according to every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and according to every good, deed. But I suppose&mdash; in this also following the Apostle, but comparing also the sayings of Ezekiel, in which the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of him who is a perfect convert are wiped out, and the former uprightness of him who has utterly fallen away is not held of account&mdash; that in the case of him who is perfected, and has altogether laid aside <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are wiped out, but that, in the case of him who has altogether revolted from <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, if anything good was formerly done by him, it is not taken into account. <span class="stiki" id="note095749"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse21">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:21-24</a></span> But to us, who occupy a middle position between the perfect man and the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, when we stand before the judgment-seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note095750"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:10</a></span> there is rendered what we have done, whether good or bad; for we have not been so pure that our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> are not at all imputed unto us, nor have we fallen away to such an extent that our better actions are forgotten.</p>

<h2>31. The Simpler Interpretation of the Promise About Not Tasting of Death.</h2>

<p><q> <em>Verily I say unto you there be some of them that stand here that shall not taste of death.</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note095751"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;16:28</a></span> Some refer these things to the going up&mdash; six days after, or, as Luke says, <span class="stiki" id="note095752"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;9:28</a></span> eight days&mdash; of the three <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> into the high mountain with Jesus apart; and those who adopt this interpretation say that Peter and the remaining two did not taste of death before they saw the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming in His own kingdom and in His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For when they saw Jesus transfigured before them so that <q>His face shone,</q> etc., <q>they saw the kingdom of God coming with power.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095753"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse1">Mark&nbsp;9:1</a></span> For even as some spear-bearers stand around a king, so <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah appeared to those who had gone up into the mountains, talking with Jesus. But it is worth while considering whether the sitting on the right hand and on the left hand of the Saviour in His kingdom refers to them, so that the words, <q>But for whom it is prepared,</q> were <span class="stiki" id="note095754"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;20:23</a></span> spoken because of them. Now this interpretation about the three Apostles not tasting of death until they have seen Jesus transfigured, is adapted to those who are designated by Peter as <q>new-born babes longing for the reasonable milk which is without guile,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095755"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:2</a></span> to whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>I have fed you with milk, not with meat,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095756"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> etc. Now, too, every interpretation of a text which is able to build up those who cannot receive greater truths might reasonably be called milk, flowing from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ground of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, which flows with milk and honey. But he who has been weaned, like Isaac, <span class="stiki" id="note095757"><a href="../bible/gen021.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;21:8</a></span> worthy of the good cheer and reception which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> gave at the weaning of his son, would seek here and in every Scripture food which is different, I think, from that which is meat, indeed, but is not solid food, and from what are figuratively called herbs, which are food to one who has been weaned and is not yet strong but weak, according to the saying, <q>He that is weak eats herbs.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095758"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;14:2</a></span> In like manner also he who has been weaned, like Samuel, and dedicated by his mother to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, &mdash; she was Hannah, which is, by interpretation, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>&mdash;would be also a son of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, seeking, like one nurtured in the temple, flesh of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> food of those who are at once perfect and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</p>

<h2>32. Standing by the Saviour.</h2>

<p>The reflections in regard to the passage before us that occur to us at the present time are these: Some were standing where Jesus was, having the footsteps of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> firmly planted with Jesus, and the standing of their feet was akin to the standing of which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said in the passage, <q>And I stood on the mountain forty days and forty nights,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095760"><a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy&nbsp;10:10</a></span> who was deemed worthy to have it said to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who asked him to stand by Him, <q>But stand here with Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095761"><a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse31">Deuteronomy&nbsp;5:31</a></span> Those who really stand by Jesus&mdash; that is, by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>&mdash; do not all stand equally; for among those who stand by Jesus are differences from each other. Wherefore, not all who stand by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, but some of them as standing better, do not taste of death until they shall have seen the Word who dwelt with men, and on that account called <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, coming in His own kingdom; for Jesus does not always come in His own kingdom when He comes, since to the newly initiated He is such that they might say, beholding the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> nor great, but inferior to many among them, <q>We saw Him, and He had no form or beauty, but His form was dishonoured, defective compared with all the sons of men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095762"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;53:2-3</a></span> And these things will be said by those who beheld His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in connection with their own former times, when at first the Word as understood in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> had no form nor beauty to them. To the Word, therefore, who has assumed most manifestly the power above all words, there belongs a royal dignity which is visible to some of those who stand by Jesus, when they have been able to follow Him as He goes before them and ascends to the lofty mountain of His own manifestation. And of this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> some of those who stand by Jesus are deemed worthy if they be either a Peter against whom the gates of Hades do not prevail, or the sons of thunder, <span class="stiki" id="note095763"><a href="../bible/mar003.htm#verse17">Mark&nbsp;3:17</a></span> and are begotten of the mighty voice of God who thunders and cries aloud from heaven great things to those who have ears and are wise. Such at least do not taste death.</p>

<h2>33. Interpretation of <q>Tasting of Death.</q></h2>

<p>But we must seek to understand what is meant by <q>tasting of death.</q> And He is life who says, <q>I am the life,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095764"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> and this life assuredly has been hidden with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and. <q>when Christ our life shall be manifested, then along with Him</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095765"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse3">Colossians&nbsp;3:3-4</a></span> shall be manifested those who are worthy of being manifested with Him in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But the enemy of this life, who is also the last enemy of all His enemies that shall be destroyed, is death, <span class="stiki" id="note095766"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:26</a></span> of which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> dies, having the opposite disposition to that which takes place in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that lives uprightly, and in consequence of living uprightly lives. And when it is said in the law, <q>I have placed life before your face,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095767"><a href="../bible/deu030.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;30:15</a></span> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says this about Him who said, <q>I am the Life,</q> and about His enemy, death; the one or other of which each of us by his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> is always choosing. And when we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with life before our face, the curse is fulfilled against us which says, <q>And your life shall be hanging up before you,</q> etc., down to the words, <q>and for the sights of your eyes which you shall see.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095768"><a href="../bible/deu028.htm#verse66">Deuteronomy&nbsp;28:66-67</a></span> As, therefore, the Life is also the living bread which came down from heaven and gave life to the world, <span class="stiki" id="note095769"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;6:33,&nbsp;51</a></span> so His enemy death is dead bread. Now every rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is fed either on living bread or dead bread, by the opinions good or bad which it receives. As then in the case of more common foods it is the practice at one time only to taste them, and at another to eat of them more largely; so also, in the case of these loaves, one eats insufficiently only tasting them, but another is satiated&mdash;he that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or is on the way to being good with the living bread which came down from heaven, but he that is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> with the dead bread, which is death; and some perhaps sparingly, and sinning a little, only taste of death; but those who have attained to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> do not even taste of it, but are always fed on the living bread. It naturally followed then in the case of Peter, against whom the gates of Hades will not prevail, that he did not taste of death, since any one tastes of death and eats death at the time when the gates of Hades prevail against him; and one eats or tastes of death in proportion as the gates of Hades to a greater or less extent, more or fewer in number, prevail against him. But also for the sons of thunder who were begotten of thunder, which is a heavenly thing, it was impossible to taste of death, which is extremely far removed from thunder, their mother. But these things the Word prophesies to those who shall be perfected, and who by standing with the Word advanced so far that they did not taste of death, until they saw the manifestation and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the kingdom and the excellency of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> in virtue of which He excels every word, which by an appearance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> draws away and drags about those who are not able to break through the bonds of distraction, and go up to the height of the excellency of the Word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>34. Meaning of <q>Until.</q> No Limitation of Promise.</h2>

<p>But since some one may think that the promise of the Saviour prescribes a limit of time to their not tasting of death, namely, that they will not taste of death <q>until</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095770"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;16:28</a></span> they see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming in His own kingdom, but after this will taste of it, let us show that according to the scriptural usage the word <q>until</q> signifies that the time concerning the thing signified is pressing, but is not so defined that after the <q>until,</q> that which is contrary to the thing signified should at all take place. Now, the Saviour says to the eleven <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when He rose from the dead, this among other things, <q>Lo, I am with you all the days, even until the consummation of the age.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095771"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;28:20</a></span> When He said this, did He promise that He was going to be with them until the consummation of the age, but that after the consummation of the age, when another age was at hand, which is <q>called the age to come,</q> He would be no longer with them?&mdash; so that according to this, the condition of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> would be better before the consummation of the age than after the consummation of the age? But I do not think that any one will dare to say, that after the consummation of the age the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> will be no longer with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, because the expression declares that He will be with them for so long, until the consummation of the age is at hand; for it is clear that the matter under inquiry was, whether the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was immediately going to be with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> before the age to come and the hoped for promises of God which were given as a recompense. But there might have been a question&mdash; it being granted that He would be with them&mdash; whether sometimes He was present with them, and sometimes not present. Wherefore setting us free from the suspicion that might have arisen from <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, He declared that now and even all the days He would be with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and that He would not leave those who had become His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> until the consummation of the age; (because He said <q>all the days</q> He did not deny that by night, when the sun set, He would be present with them.) But if such is the force of the words, <q>until the consummation of the age,</q> plainly we shall not be compelled to admit that those who see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming in His own kingdom shall taste of death, after being deemed worthy of beholding Him in such guise. But as in the case of the passage we brought forward, the urgent necessity was to teach us that <q>until the consummation of the age</q> He would not leave us but be with us all the days; so also in this case I think that it is clear to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to look at the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> coherence of things that He who has seen once for all <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming in His own kingdom,</q> and seen Him <q>in His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> and seen <q>the kingdom of God come with power,</q> could not possibly taste of death after the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of things so good and great. But apart from the word of the promise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, we have conjectured not without reason that we would taste of death, so long as we were not yet held worthy to see <q>the kingdom of God come with power,</q> and <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming in His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and in His own kingdom.</q></p>

<h2>35. Scriptural References to Death.</h2>

<p>But since here it is written in the three Evangelists, <q>They shall not taste of death,</q>  but in other writers different things are written concerning death, it may not be out of place to bring forward and examine these passages along with the <q>taste.</q> In the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, then, it is said, <q>What man is he that shall live and not see death?</q>  And again, in another place, <q>Let death come upon them and let them go down into Hades alive;</q>  but in one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <q>Death becoming mighty has swallowed them up;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095775"><a href="../bible/isa025.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;25:8</a></span> and in the Apocalypse, <q>Death and Hades follow some.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095776"><a href="../bible/rev006.htm#verse10">Revelation&nbsp;6:10</a></span> Now in these passages it appears to me that it is one thing to taste of death, but another thing to see death, and another thing for it to come upon some, and that a fourth thing, different from the aforesaid, is signified by the words, <q>Death becoming mighty has swallowed them up,</q> and a fifth thing, different from these, by the words, Death and Hades follow them. And if you were to collect them, you would perhaps find also other differences than those which we have mentioned, by a comparison of which with one another and right investigation, you would find the things signified in each place. But here I inquire whether it is a less <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to see death, but a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than seeing to taste of it, but still worse than this that death should follow any one, and not only follow him, but also now come upon him and seize him whom it formerly followed; but to be swallowed up seems to be more grievous than all the things spoken of. But giving heed to what is said, and to the differences of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed, you will not I think, be slow to admit that things of this kind were intended by the Spirit who caused these things to be written in the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But, if it be necessary to give an exposition clearer than what has been said of what is signified by seeing the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming in His own kingdom, or in His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and what is signified by seeing the kingdom of God come with power, these things&mdash; whether those that are made to shine in our hearts, or that are found by those who seek, or that enter gradually into our thoughts,&mdash; let each one judge as he wills&mdash; we will set forth. He who beholds and apprehends the excellency of the Word, as he breaks down and refutes all the plausible forms of things which are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> lies but profess to be truths, sees the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, (according to the word of John, <q>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>,</q>) coming in His own kingdom; but if such an one were to behold the Word, not only breaking down plausible oppositions, but also representing His own truths with perfect clearness, he would behold His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in addition to His kingdom. And such an one indeed would see in Him the kingdom of God come with power; and he would see this, as one who is no longer now under the reign of <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which reigns in the mortal body of those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095777"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;6:12</a></span> but is ever under the orders of the king, who is God of all, whose kingdom is indeed potentially <q>within us,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095778"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;17:21</a></span> but actually, and, as Mark has called it, <q>with power,</q> and not at all in weakness within the perfect alone. These things, then, Jesus promised to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who were standing, prophesying not about all of them, but about some.</p>

<h2>36. Concerning the Transfiguration of the Saviour.</h2>

<p><q> <em>Now after six days</em>,</q> according to Matthew and Mark,  <q> <em>He takes with him Peter and James and John his brother, and leads them up into a high mountain apart, and was transfigured before them.</em></q> Now, also, let it be granted, before the exposition that occurs to us in relation to these things, that this took place long ago, and according to the letter. But it seems to me, that those who are led up by Jesus into the high mountain, and are deemed worthy of beholding His transfiguration apart, are not without purpose led up six days after the discourses previously spoken. For since in six days&mdash; the perfect number&mdash; the whole world&mdash;this perfect work of art&mdash;was made, on this account I think that he who transcends all the things of the world by beholding no longer the things which are seen, for they are temporal, but already the things which not seen, and only the things which are not seen, because that they are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, is represented in the words, <q>After six days Jesus took up with Him</q> certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. If therefore any one of us wishes to be taken by Jesus, and led up by Him into the high mountain, and be deemed worthy of beholding His transfiguration apart, let him pass beyond the six days, because he no longer beholds the things which are seen, nor longer loves the world, nor the things in the world, <span class="stiki" id="note095780"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:15</a></span> nor <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> after any worldly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of bodies, and of the riches of the body, and of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is after the flesh, and whatever things whose nature it is to distract and drag away the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the things which are better and diviner, and bring it down and fix it fast to the deceit of this age, in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> which are the foes of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For when he has passed through the six days, as we have said, he will keep a new <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, rejoicing in the lofty mountain, because he sees Jesus transfigured before him; for the Word has different forms, as He appears to each as is expedient for the beholder, and is manifested to no one beyond the capacity of the beholder.</p>

<h2>37. Force of the Words <q>Before Them.</q></h2>

<p>But you will ask if, when He was transfigured before those who were led up by Him into the lofty mountain, He appeared to them in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which He formerly was, so that He had to those below the form of a servant, but to those who had followed Him after the six days to the lofty mountain, He had not that form, but the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But hear these things, if you can, at the same time giving heed spiritually, that it is not said simply, <q>He was transfigured,</q> but with a certain necessary addition, which Matthew and Mark have recorded; for, according to both, <q>He was transfigured before them.</q>  And according to this, indeed, you will say that it is possible for Jesus to be transfigured before some with this transfiguration, but before others at the same time not to be transfigured. But if you wish to see the transfiguration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> before those who went up into the lofty mountain apart long with Him, behold with me the Jesus in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, as more simply apprehended, and as one might say, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <q>according to the flesh,</q> by those who do not go up, through works and words which are uplifting, to the lofty mountain of wisdom, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> no longer after the flesh, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in His divinity by means of all the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and beholden in the form of God according to their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for before them is Jesus transfigured, and not to any one of those below. But when He is transfigured, His face also shines as the sun, that He may be manifested to the children of light, who have put off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light, <span class="stiki" id="note095782"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;13:12</a></span> and are no longer the children of darkness or night, but have become the sons of day, and walk honestly as in the day;  and being manifested, He will shine unto them not simply as the sun, but as demonstrated to be the sun of righteousness.</p>

<h2>38. The Garments White as the Light.</h2>

<p>And not only is He transfigured before such <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, nor does He only add to the transfiguration the shining of His face as the sun; but further also to those who were led up by Him into the high mountain apart, His garments appear white as the light. <span class="stiki" id="note095784"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;17:2</a></span> But the garments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> are the expressions and letters of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> with which He invested Himself. But I think that even the words in the Apostles which indicate the truths concerning Him are garments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, which become white to those who go up into the high mountain along with Jesus. But since there are differences also of things white, His garments become white as the brightest and purest of all white things; and that is light. When therefore you see any one not only with a thorough understanding of the theology concerning Jesus, but also making clear every expression of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, do not hesitate to say that to Him the garments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> have become white as the light. But when the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in His transfiguration is so understood and beheld, that His face is a sun, and His garments white as the light, straightway there will appear to him who beholds Jesus in such form <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>&mdash;the law&mdash; and Elijah,&mdash; in the way of synecdoche, not one <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> only, but all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; holding converse with Jesus; for such is the force of the words <q>talking with Him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095785"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;17:3</a></span> but, according to Luke, <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah appeared in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> down to the words, <q>in Jerusalem.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095786"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;9:30-31</a></span> But if any one sees the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, having understood the spiritual law as a discourse in harmony with Jesus, and the wisdom in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which is hidden in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note095787"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> he sees <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> when he sees them with Jesus.</p>

<h2>39. Jesus Was Transfigured&mdash; <q>As He Was Praying.</q></h2>

<p>Then, since it will be necessary to expound the passage as given in Mark, <q> <em>And as He was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> He was transfigured before them</em>,</q>  we must say that perhaps it is possible especially to see the Word transfigured before us if we have done the things aforesaid, and gone up into the mountain, and seen the absolute Word holding converse with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to Him for such things as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> High-Priest might <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for to the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. But in order that He may thus hold fellowship with God and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He goes up into the mountain; and then, according to Mark, <q>His garments become white and glistening as the light, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095789"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse3">Mark&nbsp;9:3</a></span> And perhaps the fullers upon the earth are the wise men of this world who are careful about the diction which they consider to be bright and pure, so that even their base thoughts and false <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> seem to be beautified by their fulling, so to speak; but He who shows His own garments glistering to those who have ascended and brighter than their fulling can make them, is the Word, who exhibits in the expressions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which are despised by many the glistering of the thoughts, when the raiment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, according to Luke, becomes white and dazzling. <span class="stiki" id="note095790"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;9:29</a></span> </p>

<h2>40. Discussion of the Saying of Peter.</h2>

<p>But let us next see what was the thought of Peter when he answered and said to Jesus, <q> <em>Lord, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles</em>,</q>  etc. And on this account these words call for very special examination, because Mark, in his own person, has added, <q>For he knew not what to answer,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095792"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse6">Mark&nbsp;9:6</a></span> but Luke, <q>not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>,</q> he says, <q>what he spoke.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095793"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;9:33</a></span> You will consider, therefore, if he spoke these things as in a trance, being filled with the spirit which moved him to say these things, which could not be a <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; for John taught in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that, before the resurrection of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, no one had the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, saying, <q>For the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095794"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;7:39</a></span> But if the Spirit was not yet, and he, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what he said, spoke under the influence of some spirit, the spirit which caused these things to be said was some one of the spirits which had not yet been triumphed over in the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, nor made a show of along with them, about whom it is written, <q>Having put off from Himself the principalities and the powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in the cross.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095795"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> But this spirit was perhaps that which is called a stumbling-block by Jesus, and which is spoken of as <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> in the passage, <q>Get behind Me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; you are a stumbling-block unto me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095796"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;16:23</a></span> But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well that such things will offend many who meet with them, because they think that it is opposed to sound reason that he should be spoken ill of who a little before had been pronounced blessed by Jesus, on the ground that the Father in heaven had revealed to him the things concerning the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, to-wit, that He was verily Jesus, and the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and the Son of the living God. But let such an one attend more exactly to the statements about Peter and the rest of the Apostles, how even they made requests as if they were yet alien from Him who was to redeem them from the enemy and purchase them with His own precious blood; or let them also, who will have it that even before the passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the Apostles were perfect, tell us whence it came about that <q>Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095797"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;9:32</a></span> But to anticipate something else of what follows and apply it to the subject in hand, I would raise in turn these questions&mdash;whether it is possible for any one to find occasion of stumbling in Jesus apart from the working of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who caused him to stumble; and whether it is possible for any one to deny Jesus, and that in presence of a little maid and a doorkeeper and men most worthless, unless a spirit had been with him in his denial hostile to the Spirit which is given and the wisdom, (which is given) to those who are assisted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to make confession, according to a certain desert of theirs. But he who has learned to refer the roots of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the father of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, will not say that apart from him either the Apostles were caused to stumble, or that Peter denied Christ thrice before that well-known cock-crowing. But if this be so, consider whether perhaps with a view to make Jesus stumble, so far as was in his power, and to turn Him aside from the dispensation whose characteristic was suffering that brought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which He undertook with great willingness, seeking to effect these things which seemed to contribute to this end, he himself also here wishes as it were, by deceit, to draw away Jesus, as if calling upon Him no longer to condescend to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and come to them, and undergo death for them, but to abide on the high mountain with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah. But he promised also to build three tabernacles, one apart for Jesus, and one for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and one for Elijah, as if one tabernacle would not have sufficed for the three, if it had been necessary for them to be in tabernacles and in the high mountain. And perhaps also in this he acted with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> intent, when he incited him <q>who did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he said,</q> not desiring that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah should be together, but desiring to separate them from one another, under pretext of the three tabernacles. And likewise it was a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us to be here;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095798"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;17:4</a></span> for if it had been a good thing they would also have remained  there. But if it were a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, you will seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who caused the lie to be spoken; and especially since according to John, <q>When he speaks a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> he speaks of his own; for he is a liar and the father thereof;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095799"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> and as there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> apart from the working of Him who says, <q>I am the Truth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095800"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> so there is no lie apart from him who is the enemy of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. These contrary qualities, accordingly, were still in Peter <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>; and from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095801"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> but from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> he said, <q>May God be propitious to You, Lord, this shall not be unto You,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095802"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;16:20</a></span> and also, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us to be here.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095803"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;17:4</a></span> But if any one will not admit that Peter spoke these things from any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> inspiration, but that his words were of his own mere choice, and it is demanded of him how he will interpret, <q>not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what he said,</q> and, <span class="stiki" id="note095804"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;9:33</a></span> <q>for he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what to answer,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095805"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse6">Mark&nbsp;9:6</a></span> he will say, that in the former case Peter held it to be a shameful thing and unworthy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to admit that the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, whom already the Father had revealed to him, should be killed; and in the present case that, as having seen the two forms of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and the one at the transfiguration which was much more excellent, being well pleased with that, he said that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to make their sojourning in that mountain, in order that he himself and those with him might <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> as they beheld the transfiguration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and His face shining as the sun, and His garments white as the light, and, in addition to these things, might always behold in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> those whom they had once seen in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah; and that they might <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at the things which they might hear, as they talked and held intercourse with each other, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah with Jesus, and Jesus with them.</p>

<h2>41. Figurative Interpretation of the Same.</h2>

<p>But since we have not yet spent our energy in interpreting the things in the place figuratively, but have said these things by way of searching into the mere letter, let us in conformity with these things, consider whether the aforesaid Peter and the sons of thunder who were taken up into the mountain of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and who saw the transfiguration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah, who appeared in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with Him, might wish to make tabernacles in themselves for the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> who was going to dwell in them, and for His law which had been beholden in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and for the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which spoke of the decease of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, which He was about to accomplish; <span class="stiki" id="note095806"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;9:31</a></span> and Peter, as one loving the contemplative life, and having preferred that which was delightsome in it to the life among the crowd with its turmoil, said, with the design of benefiting those who desired it, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us to be here.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095807"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;17:4</a></span> But since <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> seeks not its own,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095808"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:5</a></span> Jesus did not do that which Peter thought good; wherefore He descended from the mountain to those who were not able to ascend to it and behold His transfiguration, that they might behold Him in such form as they were able to see Him. It is, therefore, the part of a righteous man who possesses <q>the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which seeks not its own</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095809"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:5</a></span> to be free from all, but to bring himself under bondage to all those below that He might gain the more of them. <span class="stiki" id="note095810"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:19</a></span> But some one, with reference to what we have alleged about the trance and the working of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit in Peter, concerning the words, <q>not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what he said,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095811"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;9:33</a></span> not accepting that interpretation of ours, may say that there were certain mentioned by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <q>desiring to be teachers of the law,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095812"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:7</a></span> who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about what they speak, but who, though they do not clearly expound the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of what is said, nor understand their meaning, make confident affirmations of things which they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Of such a nature was the affection of Peter also, for not apprehending what was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> with reference to the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and of those who appeared in the mountain&mdash;<a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah,&mdash; he says, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us to be here,</q> etc., <q>not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what he said,</q> <q>for he knew not what to say,</q> for if <q>a wise man will understand the things from his own mouth, and carries <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in his lips,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095813"><a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse23">Proverbs&nbsp;16:23</a></span> he who is not so does not understand the things from his own mouth, nor comprehend the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the things spoken by him.</p>

<h2>42. The Meaning of the <q>Bright Cloud.</q></h2>

<p>Next to these come the words, <q> <em>While He was yet speaking, behold, also, a bright cloud overshadowed them</em>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095814"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;17:5</a></span> etc. Now, I think that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wishing to dissuade Peter from making three tabernacles, under which so far as it depended on his choice he was going to dwell, shows a tabernacle better, so to speak, and much more excellent, the cloud. For since it is the function of a tabernacle to overshadow him who is in it, and to shelter him, and the bright cloud overshadowed them, God made, as it were, a diviner tabernacle, inasmuch as it was bright, that it might be to them a pattern of the resurrection to come; for a bright cloud overshadows the just, who are at once protected and illuminated and shone upon by it. But what might the bright cloud, which overshadows the just, be? Is it, perhaps, the fatherly power, from which comes the voice of the Father bearing testimony to the Son as beloved and well-pleasing, and exhorting those who were under its shadow to hear Him and no other one? But as He speaks of old, so also always does He speak through what He wills. And perhaps, too, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the bright cloud which overshadows the just, and prophesies of the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who works in it, and says, <q>This is My beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased;</q> but I would venture also to say that our Saviour is a bright cloud. When, therefore, Peter said, <q>Let us make here three tabernacles,</q>. ..one from the Father Himself, and from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and one from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For a bright cloud of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> overshadows the genuine <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Jesus; or a cloud overshadows the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, which is bright to him who is able to see the light of it in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and the law, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. But perhaps the voice from the cloud says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah, <q>This is My beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased, hear Him,</q> as they were desirous to see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, and to hear Him, and to behold Him as He was in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And perhaps it teaches the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that He who was, in a literal sense, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and His beloved in whom He was well-pleased, whom it behooved them especially to hear, was He who was then beheld, and transfigured, and whose face shone as the sun, and who was clothed with garments white as the light.</p>

<h2>43. Relation of Moses and Elijah to Jesus. The Injunction of Silence.</h2>

<p>But after these things it is written that, when they heard the voice from the cloud bearing testimony to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the three Apostles, not being able to bear the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the voice and power resting upon it, <q>fell on their face,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095816"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;17:6</a></span> and besought <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for they were sore afraid at the supernatural sight, and the things which were spoken from the sight. But consider if you can also say this with reference to the details in the passage, that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, having understood that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had been holding conference with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and that it was He who said, <q>A man shall not see My face and live,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095817"><a href="../bible/exo030.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;30:20</a></span> and taking further the testimony of God about Him, as not being able to endure the radiance of the Word, humbled themselves under the mighty hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note095818"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:6</a></span> but, after the touch of the Word, lifting up their eyes they saw Jesus only and no other. <span class="stiki" id="note095819"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;17:8</a></span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the law, and Elijah, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, became one only with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Jesus; and not, as they were formerly three, did they so abide, but the three became one. But consider these things with me in relation to mystical matters; for in regard to the bare meaning of the letter, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah, having appeared in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and talked with Jesus, went away to the place from which they had come, perhaps to communicate the words which Jesus spoke with them, to those who were to be benefited by Him, almost immediately, namely, at the time of the passion, when many bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that had fallen asleep, their tombs being opened, were to go to the city which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>&mdash; not the Jerusalem which Jesus wept over&mdash; and there appear unto many. <span class="stiki" id="note095820"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse52">Matthew&nbsp;27:52-53</a></span> But after the dispensation in the mountain, when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were coming down from the mountain in order that, when they had come to the multitude, they might serve the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the people, Jesus commanded the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> saying, <q>Tell the vision to no man until the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> rise from the dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095821"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;17:9</a></span> But that saying, <q>Tell the vision to no man,</q> is like that which was investigated in the passage above, when <q>He enjoined the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to tell no man that He was the Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note095822"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;16:20</a></span> Wherefore the things that were said at that passage may be useful to us also for the passage before us; since Jesus wishes also, in accordance with these, that the things of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should not be spoken of, before His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> after the passion; for those who heard, and in particular the multitudes, would have been injured when they saw Him crucified, who had been so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. Wherefore since His being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the resurrection was akin to His transfiguration, and to the vision of His face as the sun, on this account He wishes that these things should then be spoken of by the Apostles, when He rose from the dead.</p>
