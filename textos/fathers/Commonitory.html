<h1>Commonitory </h1>

<p><strong>For the Antiquity and Universality of the Catholic Faith Against the Profane Novelties of All Heresies.</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p><strong>The Object of the Following Treatise.</strong></p>

<p>[1.] <span class="sc">I, Peregrinus</span>,  who am the least of all the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, remembering the admonition of Scripture, <q>Ask your fathers and they will tell you, your elders and they will declare unto you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350424"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse7">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:7</a></span> and again, <q>Bow down your ear to the words of the wise,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350425"><a href="../bible/pro022.htm#verse17">Proverbs&nbsp;22:17</a></span> and once more, <q>My son, forget not these instructions, but let your heart keep my words:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350426"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;3:1</a></span> remembering these admonitions, I say, I, Peregrinus, am persuaded, that, the Lord helping me, it will be of no little use and certainly as regards my own feeble powers, it is most necessary, that I should put down in writing the things which I have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfully</a> received from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, since I shall then have ready at hand wherewith by constant reading to make amends for the weakness of my memory.</p>

<p>[2.] To this I am incited not only by regard to the fruit to be expected from my labour but also by the consideration of time and the opportuneness of place:</p>

<p>By the consideration of time,&mdash; for seeing that time seizes upon all things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, we also in turn ought to snatch from it something which may profit us to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, especially since a certain awful expectation of the approach of the divine judgment importunately demands increased earnestness in religion, while the subtle craftiness of new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> calls for no ordinary care and attention.</p>

<p>I am incited also by the opportuneness of place, in that, avoiding the concourse and crowds of cities, I am dwelling in the seclusion of a Monastery, situated in a remote grange,  where, I can follow without distraction the Psalmist's  admonition, <q>Be still, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am God.</q></p>

<p>Moreover, it suits well with my purpose in adopting this life; for, whereas I was at one time involved in the manifold and deplorable tempests of secular warfare, I have now at length, under Christ's auspices, cast anchor in the harbour of religion, a harbour to all always most safe, in order that, having there been freed from the blasts of vanity and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and propitiating God by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> humility, I may be able to escape not only the shipwrecks of the present life, but also the flames of the world to come.</p>

<p>[3.] But now, in the Lord's name, I will set about the object I have in view; that is to say, to record with the fidelity of a narrator rather than the presumption of an author, the things which our forefathers have handed down to us and committed to our keeping, yet observing this rule in what I write, that I shall by no means touch upon everything that might be said, but only upon what is necessary; nor yet in an ornate and exact style, but in simple and ordinary language,  so that the most part may seem to be intimated, rather than set forth in detail. Let those cultivate elegance and exactness who are confident of their ability or are moved by a sense of duty. For me it will be enough to have provided a <span class="sc">Commonitory</span> (or Remembrancer) for myself, such as may aid my memory, or rather, provide against my forgetfulness: which same Commonitory however, I shall endeavor, the Lord helping me, to amend and make more complete little by little, day by day, by recalling to mind what I have learned. I mention this at the outset, that if by chance what I write should slip out of my possession and come into the hands of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, they may forbear to blame anything therein hastily, when they see that there is a promise that it will yet be amended and made more complete.</p>
<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p><strong>A General Rule for distinguishing the Truth of the Catholic Faith from the Falsehood of Heretical Pravity.</strong></p>

<p>[4.] I have often then inquired earnestly and attentively of very many men eminent for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and learning, how and by what sure and so to speak universal rule I may be able to distinguish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> pravity; and I have always, and in almost every instance, received an answer to this effect: That whether I or any one else should wish to detect the frauds and avoid the snares of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as they rise, and to continue sound and complete in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we must, the Lord helping, fortify our own belief in two ways; first, by the authority of the Divine Law, and then, by the Tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>[5.] But here some one perhaps will ask, Since the canon of Scripture is complete, and sufficient of itself for everything, and more than sufficient, what need is there to join with it the authority of the Church's interpretation? For this reason&mdash;because, owing to the depth of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, all do not accept it in one and the same sense, but one understands its words in one way, another in another; so that it seems to be capable of as many interpretations as there are interpreters. For <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> expounds it one way, Sabellius another, Donatus another, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, Eunomius, Macedonius, another, Photinus, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, Priscillian, another, Iovinian, Pelagius, Celestius, another, lastly, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> another. Therefore, it is very necessary, on account of so great intricacies of such various <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, that the rule for the right understanding of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> should be framed in accordance with the standard of Ecclesiastical and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interpretation.</p>

<p>[6.] Moreover, in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, all possible care must be taken, that we hold that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which has been <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> everywhere, always, by all. For that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and in the strictest sense <q><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>,</q> which, as the name itself and the reason of the thing declare, comprehends all universally. This rule we shall observe if we follow universality, antiquity, consent. We shall follow universality if we confess that one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, which the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout the world confesses; antiquity, if we in no wise depart from those interpretations which it is manifest were notoriously held by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ancestors and fathers; consent, in like manner, if in antiquity itself we adhere to the consentient definitions and determinations of all, or at the least of almost all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and doctors.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p><strong>What is to be done if one or more dissent from the rest.</strong></p>

<p>[7.] What then will a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> do, if a small portion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have cut itself off from the communion of the universal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? What, surely, but prefer the soundness of the whole body to the unsoundness of a pestilent and corrupt member? What, if some novel contagion seek to infect not merely an insignificant portion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but the whole? Then it will be his care to cleave to antiquity, which at this day cannot possibly be seduced by any fraud of novelty.</p>

<p>[8.] But what, if in antiquity itself there be found <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> on the part of two or three men, or at any rate of a city or even of a province? Then it will be his care by all means, to prefer the decrees, if such there be, of an ancient General Council to the rashness and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of a few. But what, if some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> should spring up on which no such decree is found to bear? Then he must collate and consult and interrogate the opinions of the ancients, of those, namely, who, though living in various times and places, yet continuing in the communion and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, stand forth acknowledged and approved authorities: and whatsoever he shall ascertain to have been held, written, taught, not by one or two of these only, but by all, equally, with one consent, openly, frequently, persistently, that he must understand that he himself also is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or hesitation.</p>
<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p><strong>The evil resulting from the bringing in of Novel Doctrine shown in the instances of the Donatists and Arians.</strong></p>

<p>[9.] But that we may make what we say more intelligible, we must illustrate it by individual examples, and enlarge upon it somewhat more fully, lest by aiming at too great brevity important matters be hurried over and lost sight of.</p>

<p>In the time of Donatus,  from whom his followers were called <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, when great numbers in Africa were rushing headlong into their own mad <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and unmindful of their name, their religion, their profession, were preferring the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> temerity of one man before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then they alone throughout Africa were safe within the sacred precincts of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who, detesting the profane <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, continued in communion with the universal Church, leaving to posterity an illustrious example, how, and how well in future the soundness of the whole body should be preferred before the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of one, or at most of a few.</p>

<p>[10.] So also when the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> poison had infected not an insignificant portion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> but almost the whole world,  so that a sort of blindness had fallen upon almost all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>  of the Latin tongue, circumvented partly by force partly by fraud, and was preventing them from seeing what was most expedient to be done in the midst of so much confusion, then whoever was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> lover and worshipper of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, preferring the ancient belief to the novel misbelief, escaped the pestilent infection.</p>

<p>[11.] By the peril of which time was abundantly shown how great a calamity the introduction of a novel doctrine causes. For then <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> not only interests of small account, but others of the very gravest importance, were subverted. For not only affinities, relationships, friendships, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, but moreover, cities, peoples, provinces, nations, at last the whole Roman Empire, were shaken to their foundation and ruined. For when this same profane <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> novelty, like a Bellona or a Fury, had first taken captive the Emperor,  and had then subjected all the principal <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the palace to new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, from that time it never ceased to involve everything in confusion, disturbing all things, public and private, sacred and profane, paying no regard to what was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but, as though holding a position of authority, smiting whomsoever it pleased. Then wives were violated, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> ravished, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> profaned, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> demolished, clergymen ejected, the inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> scourged, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> driven into exile, jails, prisons, mines, filled with <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, of whom the greater part, forbidden to enter into cities, thrust forth from their homes to wander in deserts and caves, among rocks and the haunts of wild beasts, exposed to nakedness, hunger, thirst, were worn out and consumed. Of all of which was there any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> than that, while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> are being brought in to supplant heavenly doctrine, while well established antiquity is being subverted by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> novelty, while the institutions of former ages are being set at naught, while the decrees of our fathers are being rescinded, while the determinations of our ancestors are being torn in pieces, the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of profane and novel curiosity refuses to restrict itself within the most chaste limits of hallowed and uncorrupt antiquity? </p>
<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p><strong>The Example set us by the Martyrs, whom no force could hinder from defending the Faith of their Predecessors.</strong></p>

<p>[12.] But it may be, we invent these charges out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to novelty and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for antiquity. Whoever is disposed to listen to such an insinuation, let him at least <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the blessed Ambrose, who, deploring the acerbity of the time, says, in the second book of his work addressed to the <a href="../cathen/06729c.htm">Emperor Gratian</a>:  <q>Enough now, O God Almighty! Have we expiated with our own ruin, with our own blood, the slaughter of Confessors, the banishment of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of such extreme impiety. It is clear, beyond question, that they who have violated the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot remain in safety.</q></p>

<p>And again in the third book of the same work,  <q>Let us observe the precepts of our predecessors, and not transgress with rude rashness the landmarks which we have inherited from them. That sealed Book of Prophecy no Elders, no Powers, no Angels, no Archangels, dared to open. To Christ alone was reserved the prerogative of explaining it. <span class="stiki" id="note350437"><a href="../bible/rev005.htm#verse1">Revelation&nbsp;5:1-5</a></span> Who of us may dare to unseal the Sacerdotal Book sealed by Confessors, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> already by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of numbers, which they who had been compelled by force to unseal afterwards resealed, condemning the fraud which had been practised upon them; while they who had not ventured to tamper with it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> themselves Confessors and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>? How can we deny the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those whose victory we proclaim?</q></p>

<p>[13.] We proclaim it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, O venerable Ambrose, we proclaim it, and applaud and admire. For who is there so demented, who, though not able to overtake, does not at least earnestly desire to follow those whom no force could deter from defending the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of their ancestors, no threats, no blandishments, not life, not death, not the palace, not the Imperial Guards, not the Emperor, not the empire itself, not men, not <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>?&mdash; whom, I say, as a recompense for their steadfastness in adhering to religious antiquity, the Lord counted worthy of so great a reward, that by their instrumentality He restored churches which had been destroyed, quickened with new life peoples who were spiritually dead, replaced on the heads of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the crowns which had been torn from them, washed out those abominable, I will not say letters, but blotches (<em>non literas, sed lituras</em>) of novel impiety, with a fountain of believing tears, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> opened in the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>?&mdash; lastly, when almost the whole world was overwhelmed by a ruthless tempest of unlooked for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, recalled it from novel misbelief to the ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of novelty to the soundness of antiquity, from the blindness of novelty to pristine light?</p>

<p>[14.] But in this divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as we may call it, exhibited by these Confessors, we must note especially that the defence which they then undertook in appealing to the Ancient Church, was the defence, not of a part, but of the whole body. For it was not right that men of such eminence should uphold with so huge an effort the vague and conflicting notions of one or two men, or should exert themselves in the defence of some ill-advised combination of some petty province; but adhering to the decrees and definitions of the universal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Holy Church</a>, the heirs of Apostolic and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they chose rather to deliver up themselves than to betray the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of universality and antiquity. For which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> they were deemed worthy of so great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as not only to be accounted Confessors, but rightly, and deservedly to be accounted foremost among Confessors.</p>
<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p><strong>The example of Pope Stephen in resisting the Iteration of Baptism.</strong></p>

<p>[15.] Great then is the example of these same blessed men, an example plainly divine, and worthy to be called to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and meditated upon continually by every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, who, like the seven-branched candlestick, shining with the sevenfold light of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, showed to posterity how thenceforward the audaciousness of profane novelty, in all the several rantings of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, might be crushed by the authority of hallowed antiquity.</p>

<p>Nor is there anything new in this? For it has always been the case in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that the more a man is under the influence of religion, so much the more prompt is he to oppose innovations. Examples there are without number: but to be brief, we will take one, and that, in preference to others, from the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>,  so that it may be clearer than day to every one with how great energy, with how great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, with how great earnestness, the blessed successors of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> have constantly defended the integrity of the religion which they have once received.</p>

<p>[16.] Once on a time then, <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agripinnus</a>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, of venerable memory, held the doctrine&mdash; and he was the first who held it&mdash; that Baptism ought to be repeated, contrary to the divine canon, contrary to the rule of the universal Church, contrary to the customs and institutions of our ancestors. This innovation drew after it such an amount of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that it not only gave an example of sacrilege to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of all sorts, but <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> an occasion of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to certain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> even.</p>

<p>When then all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> protested against the novelty, and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> everywhere, each as his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> prompted him, opposed it, Pope Stephen of blessed memory, Prelate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, in conjunction indeed with his colleagues but yet himself the foremost, withstood it, thinking it right, I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not, that as he exceeded all others in the authority of his place, so he should also in the devotion of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In fine, in an epistle sent at the time to Africa, he laid down this rule: <q>Let there be no innovation&mdash; nothing but what has been handed down.</q>  For that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> admits no other rule than that whatsoever things have been faithfully received from our fathers the same are to be faithfully consigned to our children; and that it is our duty, not to lead religion whither we would, but rather to follow religion whither it leads; and that it is the part of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> modesty and gravity not to hand down our own beliefs or observances to those who come after us, but to preserve and keep what we have received from those who went before us. What then was the issue of the whole matter? What but the usual and customary one? Antiquity was retained, novelty was rejected.</p>

<p>[17.] But it may be, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of innovation at that time lacked patronage. On the contrary, it had in its favor such powerful talent, such copious eloquence, such a number of partisans, so much resemblance to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, such weighty support in Scripture (only interpreted in a novel and perverse sense), that it seems to me that that whole conspiracy could not possibly have been defeated, unless the sole <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this extraordinary stir, the very novelty of what was so undertaken, so defended, so belauded, had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> wanting to it. In the end, what result, under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had that same African Council or decree?  None whatever. The whole affair, as though a dream, a fable, a thing of no possible account, was annulled, cancelled, and trodden underfoot.</p>

<p>[18.] And O marvellous revolution! The authors of this same doctrine are judged <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the followers <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; the teachers are absolved, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> condemned; the writers of the books will be children of the Kingdom, the defenders of them will have their portion in Hell. For who is so demented as to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that that blessed light among all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Cyprian, together with the rest of his colleagues, will reign with Christ; or, who on the other hand so <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> as to deny that the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> and those other pests, who boast the authority of that council for their iteration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, will be consigned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? </p>
<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p><strong>How Heretics, craftily cite obscure passages in ancient writers in support of their own novelties.</strong></p>

<p>[19.] This condemnation, indeed,  seems to have been providentially promulgated as though with a special view to the fraud of those who, contriving to dress up a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> under a name other than its own, get hold often of the works of some ancient writer, not very clearly expressed, which, owing to the very obscurity of their own doctrine, have the appearance of agreeing with it, so that they get the credit of being neither the first nor the only <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have held it. This <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of theirs, in my judgment, is doubly hateful: first, because they are not afraid to invite others to drink of the poison of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; and secondly, because with profane breath, as though fanning smouldering embers into flame, they blow upon the memory of each <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, and spread an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report of what ought to be buried in silence by bringing it again under notice, thus treading in the footsteps of their father Ham, who not only forebore to cover the nakedness of the venerable <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, but told it to the others that they might laugh at it, offending thereby so grievously against the duty of filial <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, that even his descendants were involved with him in the curse which he drew down, widely differing from those blessed brothers of his, who would neither pollute their own eyes by looking upon the nakedness of their revered father, nor would suffer others to do so, but went backwards, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, and covered him, that is, they neither approved nor betrayed the fault of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, for which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> they were rewarded with a benediction on themselves and their posterity. <span class="stiki" id="note350444"><a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;9:22</a></span> </p>

<p>[20.] But to return to the matter in hand: It behooves us then to have a great dread of the crime of perverting the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and adulterating religion, a crime from which we are deterred not only by the Church's discipline, but also by the censure of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> authority.

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p><strong>Exposition of St. Paul's Words, <a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse8">Gal. i. 8</a>.</strong></p>

<p>[21.] When therefore certain of this sort wandering about provinces and cities, and carrying with them their venal <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, had found their way to Galatia, and when the Galatians, on hearing them, nauseating the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and vomiting up the manna of Apostolic and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine, were delighted with the garbage of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> novelty, the apostle putting in exercise the authority of his office, delivered his sentence with the utmost severity, <q>Though we,</q> he says, <q>or an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven, preach any other <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350457"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;1:8</a></span> </p>

<p>[22.] Why does he say <q>Though we</q>? Why not rather <q>though I</q>? He means, <q>though Peter, though Andrew, though John, in a word, though the whole company of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, preach unto you other than we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</q> Tremendous severity! He spares neither himself nor his fellow <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, so he may preserve unaltered the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was at first delivered. Nay, this is not all. He goes on <q>Even though an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven preach unto you any other <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</q> It was not enough for the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> once delivered to have referred to man; he must needs comprehend <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> also. <q>Though we,</q> he says, <q>or an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven.</q> Not that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of heaven are now capable of sinning. But what he means is: Even if that were to happen which cannot happen&mdash;if any one, be he who he may, attempt to alter the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> once for all delivered, let him be accursed.</p>

<p>[23.] But it may be, he spoke thus in the first instance inconsiderately, giving vent to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> impetuosity rather than expressing himself under divine guidance. Far from it. He follows up what he had said, and urges it with intense reiterated earnestness, <q>As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to you than that you have received, let him be accursed.</q> He does not say, <q>If any man deliver to you another message than that you have received, let him be blessed, praised, welcomed,</q>&mdash; no; but <q>let him be accursed,</q> [<a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>] i.e., separated, segregated, excluded, lest the dire contagion of a single sheep contaminate the guiltless flock of Christ by his poisonous intermixture with them.</p>
<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p><strong>His warning to the Galatians a warning to all.</strong></p>

<p>[24.] But, possibly, this warning was intended for the Galatians only. Be it so; then those other exhortations which follow in the same Epistle were intended for the Galatians only, such as, <q>If we live in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, let us also walk in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; let us not be desirous of vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, provoking one another, envying one another,</q> etc.; <span class="stiki" id="note350458"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse25">Galatians&nbsp;5:25</a></span> which alternative if it be absurd, and the injunctions were meant equally for all, then it follows, that as these injunctions which relate to morals, so those warnings which relate to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are meant equally for all; and just as it is unlawful for all to provoke one another, or to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> one another, so, likewise, it is unlawful for all to receive any other <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> than that which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> preaches everywhere.</p>

<p>[25.] Or perhaps the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> pronounced on any one who should preach another <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> than that which had been preached was meant for those times, not for the present. Then, also, the exhortation, <q>Walk in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> and you shall not fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350459"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse16">Galatians&nbsp;5:16</a></span> was meant for those times, not for the present. But if it be both impious and pernicious to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, then it follows necessarily, that as these injunctions are to be observed by all ages, so those warnings also which forbid alteration of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are warnings intended for all ages. To preach any doctrine therefore to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> other than what they have received never was lawful, never is lawful, never will be lawful: and to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who preach anything other than what has once been received, always was a duty, always is a duty, always will be a duty.</p>

<p>[26.] Which being the case, is there any one either so audacious as to preach any other doctrine than that which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> preaches, or so inconstant as to receive any other doctrine than that which he has received from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? That elect vessel, that teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that trumpet of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that preacher whose commission was to the whole earth, that man who was caught up to heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note350460"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:2</a></span> cries and cries again in his Epistles to all, always, in all places, <q>If any man preach any new doctrine, let him be accursed.</q> On the other hand, an ephemeral, moribund set of frogs, fleas, and flies, such as the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, call out in opposition, and that to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Take our word, follow our lead, accept our exposition, condemn what you used to hold, hold what you used to condemn, cast aside the ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the institutes of your fathers, the trusts left for you by your ancestors and receive instead&mdash;what? I tremble to utter it: for it is so full of arrogance and self-conceit, that it seems to me that not only to affirm it, but even to refute it, cannot be done without guilt in some sort.</p>
<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p><strong>Why Eminent Men are permitted by God to become Authors of Novelties in the Church.</strong></p>

<p>[27.] But some one will ask, How is it then, that certain excellent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and of position in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are often permitted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to preach novel doctrines to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>? A proper question, certainly, and one which ought to be very carefully and fully dealt with, but answered at the same time, not in reliance upon one's own ability, but by the authority of the divine Law, and by appeal to the Church's determination.</p>

<p>Let us listen, then, to Holy <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and let him teach us why learned men, and such as because of their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are even called Prophets by the apostle, are sometimes permitted to put forth novel doctrines, which the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is wont, by way of allegory, to call <q>strange gods,</q> forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> pay the same sort of reverence to their notions that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> do to their gods.</p>

<p>[28.] Blessed <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, then, writes thus in Deuteronomy:  <q>If there arise among you a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or a dreamer of dreams,</q> that is, one holding office as a Doctor in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> or auditors to teach by revelation: well&mdash;what follows? <q>and gives you a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spoke,</q>&mdash; he is pointing to some eminent doctor, whose learning is such that his followers <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him not only to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but, moreover, to foreknow things superhuman, such as, their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> commonly boast, were <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, Donatus, Photinus, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, and the rest of that sort! What next? <q>And shall say to you, Let us go after other gods, whom you know not, and serve them.</q> What are those other gods but strange <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which you know not, that is, new and such as were never heard of before? <q>And let us serve them;</q> that is, <q>Let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, follow them.</q> What last? <q>You shall not hearken to the words of that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or dreamer of dreams.</q> And why, I pray you, does not God forbid to be taught what God forbids to be heard? <q>For the Lord, your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, tries you, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him with all your heart and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> The reason is clearer than day why <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> sometimes permits certain doctors of the Churches to preach new doctrines&mdash; <q>That the Lord your God may try you;</q> he says. And assuredly it is a great trial when one whom you believe to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, a doctor and defender of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whom you have folded to your breast with the utmost veneration and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, when such a one of a sudden secretly and furtively brings in noxious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, which you can neither quickly detect, being held by the prestige of former authority, nor lightly think it right to condemn, being prevented by affection for your old master.</p>
<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p><strong>Examples from Church History, confirming the words of Moses&mdash;<a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, Photinus, Apollinaris.</strong></p>

<p>[29.] Here, perhaps, some one will require us to illustrate the words of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by examples from Church History. The demand is a fair one, nor shall it wait long for satisfaction.</p>

<p>For to take first a very recent and very plain case: what sort of trial, think we, was that which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had experience of the other day, when that unhappy <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>,  all at once metamorphosed from a sheep into a wolf, began to make havoc of the flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while as yet a large proportion of those whom he was devouring <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him to be a sheep, and consequently were the more exposed to his attacks? For who would readily suppose him to be in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have been elected by the high choice of the Emperor, and to be held in the greatest esteem by the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>? Who would readily suppose him to be in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, who, greatly beloved by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren, and in high favor with the populace, expounded the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> in public daily, and confuted the pestilent <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> both of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Heathens? Who could choose but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that his teaching was Orthodox, his preaching Orthodox, his belief Orthodox, who, that he might open the way to one <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of his own, was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> inveighing against the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>? But this was the very thing which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says: <q>The Lord your God does try you that He may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him or not.</q></p>

<p>[30.] Leaving <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, in whom there was always more that men admired than they were profited by, more of show than of reality, whom natural ability, rather than <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, magnified, for a time in the opinion of the common people, let us pass on to speak of those who, being <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of great attainments and of much industry, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> no small trial to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Such, for instance, was Photinus, in Pannonia,  who, in the memory of our fathers, is said to have been a trial to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sirmium, where, when he had been raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> with universal approbation, and had discharged the office for some time as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, all of a sudden, like that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or dreamer of dreams whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> refers to, he began to persuade the people whom God had entrusted, to his charge, to follow <q>strange gods,</q> that is, strange <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, which before they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not. But there was nothing unusual in this: the mischief of the matter was, that for the perpetration of so great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> he availed himself of no ordinary helps. For he was of great natural ability and of powerful eloquence, and had a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of learning, disputing and writing copiously and forcibly in both languages, as his books which remain, composed partly in Greek, partly in Latin, testify. But happily the sheep of Christ committed to him, vigilant and wary for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, quickly turned their eyes to the premonitory words of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and, though admiring the eloquence of their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and pastor, were not blind to the trial. For from thenceforward they began to flee from him as a wolf, whom formerly they had followed as the ram of the flock.</p>

<p>[31.] Nor is it only in the instance of Photinus that we learn the danger of this trial to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and are admonished withal of the need of double diligence in guarding the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>  holds out a like warning. For he gave rise to great burning questions and sore perplexities among his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, the Church's authority drawing them one way, their Master's influence the opposite; so that, wavering and tossed here and there between the two, they were at a loss what course to take.</p>

<p>But perhaps he was a person of no weight of character. On the contrary, he was so eminent and so highly esteemed that his word would only too readily be taken on whatsoever subject. For what could exceed his acuteness, his adroitness, his learning? How many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> did he, in many volumes, annihilate! How many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, hostile to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, did he confute! A <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which is that most noble and vast work, of not less than thirty books, in which, with a great mass of arguments, he repelled the insane <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of Porphyry.  It would take a long time to enumerate all his works, which assuredly would have placed him on a level with the very chief of the Church's builders, if that profane <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> curiosity had not led him to devise I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what novelty which as though through the contagion of a sort of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> both defiled all his labours, and caused his teachings to be pronounced the Church's trial instead of the Church's edification.</p>
<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p><strong>A fuller account of the Errors of Photinus, Apollinaris and Nestorius.</strong></p>

<p>[32.] Here, possibly, I may be asked for some account of the above mentioned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>; those, namely, of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, and Photinus. This, indeed, does not belong to the matter in hand: for our object is not to enlarge upon the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of individuals, but to produce instances of a few, in whom the applicability of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> words may be evidently and clearly seen; that is to say, that if at any time some Master in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, himself also a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in interpreting the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, should attempt to introduce some novel doctrine into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> permits this to happen in order to try us. It will be useful, therefore, by way of digression, to give a brief account of the opinions of the above-named <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, Photinus, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>.</p>

<p>[33.] The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Photinus, then, is as follows: He says that God is singular and sole, and is to be regarded as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> regarded Him. He denies the completeness of the Trinity, and does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is any Person of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, or any Person of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Christ he affirms to be a mere man, whose original was from Mary. Hence he insists with the utmost obstinacy that we are to render worship only to the Person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that we are to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Christ as man only. This is the doctrine of Photinus.</p>

<p>[34.] <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, affecting to agree with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as to the unity of the Trinity, though not this even with entire soundness of belief,  as to the Incarnation of the Lord, blasphemes openly. For he says that the flesh of our Saviour was either altogether devoid of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or, at all events, was devoid of a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Moreover, he says that this same flesh of the Lord was not received from the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin Mary, but came down from heaven into the Virgin; and, ever wavering and undecided, he preaches one while that it was co-eternal with <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, another that it was made of the divine nature of the Word. For, denying that there are two substances in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, one divine, the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, one from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the other from his mother, he holds that the very nature of the Word was divided, as though one part of it remained in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other was converted into flesh: so that whereas the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> says that of two substances there is one Christ, he affirms, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that of the one divinity of Christ there have become two substances. This, then, is the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>.</p>

<p>[35.] <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, whose disease is of an opposite kind, while pretending that he holds two distinct substances in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, brings in of a sudden two Persons, and with unheard of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> would have two sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, two Christs,&mdash; one, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other, man, one, begotten of his Father, the other, born of his mother. For which reason he maintains that Saint Mary ought to be called, not <em>Theotocos</em> (the mother of God), but <em>Christotocos</em> (the mother of Christ), seeing that she gave birth not to the Christ who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to the Christ who is man. But if any one supposes that in his writings he speaks of one Christ, and preaches one Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let him not lightly credit it. For either this is a crafty device, that by means of good he may the more easily persuade <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, according to that of the apostle, <q>That which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> was made death to me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350467"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;7:13</a></span> &mdash; either, I say, he craftily affects in some places in his writings to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> one Christ and one Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or else he says that after the Virgin had brought forth, the two Persons were united into one Christ, though at the time of her conception or parturition, and for some short time afterwards, there were two Christs; so that forsooth, though Christ was born at first an ordinary man and nothing more, and not as yet associated in unity of Person with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, yet afterwards the Person of the Word assuming descended upon Him; and though now the Person assumed remains in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet once there would seem to have been no difference between Him and all other men.</p>
<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p><strong>The Catholic Doctrine of the Trinity and the Incarnation explained.</strong></p>

<p>[36.] In these ways then do these rabid dogs, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, and Photinus, bark against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: Photinus, by denying the Trinity; <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, by teaching that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Word is mutable, and refusing to acknowledge that there are two substances in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, denying moreover either that Christ had a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at all, or, at all events, that he had a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and asserting that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> supplied the place of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, by affirming that there were always or at any rate that once there were two Christs. But the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, holding the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> both concerning God and concerning our Saviour, is guilty of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> neither in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Trinity, nor in that of the Incarnation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For she worships both one Godhead in the plenitude of the Trinity, and the equality of the Trinity in one and the same majesty, and she confesses one Christ Jesus, not two; the same both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the one as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> as the other.  One Person indeed she believes in Him, but two substances; two substances but one Person: Two substances, because the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is not mutable, so as to be convertible into flesh; one Person, lest by acknowledging two sons she should seem to worship not a Trinity, but a Quaternity.</p>

<p>[37.] But it will be well to unfold this same doctrine more distinctly and explicitly again and again.</p>

<p>In God there is one substance, but three Persons; in Christ two substances, but one Person. In the Trinity, another and another Person, not another and another substance (distinct Persons, not distinct substances);  in the Saviour another and another substance, not another and another Person, (distinct substances, not distinct Persons). How in the Trinity another and another Person (distinct Persons) not another and another substance (distinct substances)?  Because there is one Person of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, another of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, another of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>;  but yet there is not another and another nature (distinct natures) but one and the same nature. How in the Saviour another and another substance, not another and another Person (two distinct substances, not two distinct Persons)? Because there is one substance of the Godhead, another of the manhood. But yet the Godhead and the manhood are not another and another Person (two distinct Persons), but one and the same Christ, one and the same <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and one and the same Person of one and the same Christ and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, in like manner as in man the flesh is one thing and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> another, but one and the same man, both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh. In Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is one thing, the flesh another; yet there are not two Peters,&mdash; one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the other flesh, or two Pauls, one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the other flesh&mdash;but one and the same Peter, and one and the same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, consisting each of two diverse natures, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. Thus, then, in one and the same Christ there are two substances, one divine, the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>; one of (ex) <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the other of (ex) the Virgin Mother; one co-eternal with and co-equal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the other temporal and inferior to the Father; one consubstantial with his Father, the other, consubstantial with his Mother, but one and the same Christ in both substances. There is not, therefore, one Christ <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other man, not one uncreated, the other created; not one impassible, the other passible; not one equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the other inferior to the Father; not one of his Father (ex), the other of his Mother (ex), but one and the same Christ, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the same uncreated and created, the same unchangeable and incapable of suffering, the same acquainted by experience with both change and suffering, the same equal to the Father and inferior to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the same begotten of the Father before time, (<q>before the world</q>), the same born of his mother in time (<q>in the world</q>),  perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, perfect Man. In God supreme divinity, in man perfect humanity. Perfect humanity, I say, forasmuch as it has both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh; the flesh, very flesh; our flesh, his mother's flesh; the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, intellectual, endowed with mind and reason. There is then in Christ the Word, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the flesh; but the whole is one Christ, one <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and one our Saviour and Redeemer: One, not by I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what corruptible confusion of Godhead and manhood, but by a certain entire and singular unity of Person. For the conjunction has not converted and changed the one nature into the other, (which is the characteristic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>), but rather has in such wise compacted both into one, that while there always remains in Christ the singularity of one and the self-same Person, there abides <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> withal the characteristic property of each nature; whence it follows, that neither does God (i.e., the divine nature) ever begin to be body, nor does the body ever cease to be body. The which may be illustrated in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for not only in the present life, but in the future also, each individual man will consist of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; nor will his body ever be converted into <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into body; but while each individual man will live for ever, the distinction between the two substances will continue in each individual man for ever. So likewise in Christ each substance will for ever retain its own characteristic property, yet without prejudice to the unity of Person.</p>
<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p><strong>Jesus Christ Man in Truth, not in Semblance.</strong></p>

<p>[38.] But when we use the word <q>Person,</q> and say that God became man by means of a Person, there is reason to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that our meaning may be taken to be, that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> assumed our nature merely in imitation, and performed the actions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, being man not in reality, but only in semblance, just as in a theatre, one man within a brief space represents several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, not one of whom himself is. For when one undertakes to sustain the part of another, he performs the offices, or does the acts, of the person whose part he sustains, but he is not himself that person. So, to take an illustration from secular life and one in high favour with the Manichees, when a tragedian represents a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or a king, he is not really a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or a king. For, as soon as the play is over, the person or character whom he represented ceases to be. God forbid that we should have anything to do with such nefarious and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> mockery. Be it the infatuation of the Manichees, those preachers of hallucination, who say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> person really and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, but that He counterfeited the person of a man in feigned conversation and manner of life.</p>

<p>[39.] But the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith teaches that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> became man in such wise, that He took upon Him our nature, not feignedly  and in semblance, but in reality and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and performed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, not as though He were imitating the actions of another, but as performing His own, and as being in reality the person whose part He sustained. Just as we ourselves also, when we speak, reason, live, subsist, do not imitate men, but are men. Peter and John, for instance, were men, not by imitation, but by being men in reality. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> did not counterfeit an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, or feign himself to be <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, but was an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. So, also, that which <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> did, in His condescension, in assuming and having flesh, in speaking, acting, and suffering, through the instrumentality of flesh, yet without any marring of His own divine nature, came in one word to this:&mdash; He did not imitate or feign Himself to be perfect man, but He showed Himself to be very man in reality and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united to the flesh, but yet not changed into flesh, does not imitate man, but is man, and man not feignedly but substantially, so also <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, without any conversion of Himself, in uniting Himself to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, became man, not by confusion, not by imitation, but by actually being and subsisting. Away then, once and for all, with the notion of His Person as of an assumed fictitious character, where always what is is one thing, what is counterfeited another, where the man who acts never is the man whose part he acts. God forbid that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> to have taken upon Himself the person of a man in this illusory way. Rather let us acknowledge that while His own unchangeable substance remained, and while He took upon Himself the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of perfect man, Himself actually was flesh, Himself actually was man, Himself actually was personally man; not feignedly, but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not in imitation, but in substance; not, finally, so as to cease to be when the performance was over, but so as to be, and continue to be substantially and permanently. </p>
<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p><strong>The Union of the Divine with the Human Nature took place in the very Conception of the Virgin. The appellation <q>The Mother of God.</q></strong></p>

<p>[40.] This unity of Person, then, in Christ was not effected after His birth of the Virgin, but was compacted and perfected in her very womb. For we must take most special heed that we confess Christ not only one, but always one. For it were intolerable <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, if while you confess Him one now, you should maintain that once He was not one, but two; one forsooth since His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but two at His birth. Which monstrous sacrilege we shall assuredly in no wise avoid unless we acknowledge the manhood united to the Godhead (but by unity of Person), not from the ascension, or the resurrection, or the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but even in His mother, even in the womb, even in the Virgin's very conception.  In consequence of which unity of Person, both those attributes which are proper to God are ascribed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and those which are proper to the flesh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, indifferently and promiscuously.  For hence it is written by divine guidance, on the one hand, that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> came down from heaven; <span class="stiki" id="note350476"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;3:13</a></span> and on the other, that the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was crucified on earth. <span class="stiki" id="note350477"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> Hence it is also that since the Lord's flesh was made, since the Lord's flesh was created, the very <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is said to have been made, the very omniscient Wisdom of God to have been created, just as <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> His hands and His feet are described as having been pierced.  From this unity of Person it follows, by reason of a like <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, that, since the flesh of the Word was born of an undefiled mother, God the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself is most Catholicly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, most impiously denied, to have been born of the Virgin; which being the case, God forbid that any one should seek to defraud Holy Mary of her prerogative of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> and her special <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For by the singular gift of Him who is our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and withal, her own son, she is to be confessed most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and most blessedly&mdash; The mother of God <q>Theotocos,</q> but not in the sense in which it is imagined by a certain impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which maintains, that she is to be called the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> for no other reason than because she gave birth to that man who afterwards became <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just as we speak of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> as the mother of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or the mother of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, meaning that she was such, not by giving birth to one already a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but by giving birth to one who afterwards became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Not thus, I say, was the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Mary <q>Theotocos,</q> the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but rather, as was said before, because in her sacred womb was wrought that most sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> whereby, on account of the singular and unique unity of Person, as the Word in flesh is flesh, so Man in God is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Recapitulation of what was said of the Catholic Faith and of divers Heresies, Chapters xi-xv.</strong></p>

<p>[41.] But now that we may refresh our remembrance of what has been briefly said concerning either the afore-mentioned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> or the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, let us go over it again more briefly and concisely, that being repeated it may be more thoroughly understood, and being pressed home more firmly held.</p>

<p>Accursed then be Photinus, who does not receive the Trinity complete, but asserts that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is mere man.</p>

<p>Accursed be <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, who affirms that the Godhead of Christ is marred by conversion, and defrauds Him of the property of perfect humanity.</p>

<p>Accursed be <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, who denies that God was born of the Virgin, affirms two Christs, and rejecting the belief of the Trinity, brings in a Quaternity.</p>

<p>But blessed be the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which worships one God in the completeness of the Trinity, and at the same time adores the equality of the Trinity in the unity of the Godhead, so that neither the singularity of substance confounds the propriety of the Persons, not the distinction of the Persons in the Trinity separates the unity of the Godhead.</p>

<p>Blessed, I say, be the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which believes that in Christ there are two <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect substances but one Person, so that neither does the distinction of natures divide the unity of Person, nor the unity of Person confound the distinction of substances.</p>

<p>Blessed, I say, be the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which understands God to have become Man, not by conversion of nature, but by reason of a Person, but of a Person not feigned and transient, but substantial and permanent.</p>

<p>Blessed, I say, be the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which declares this unity of Person to be so real and effectual, that because of it, in a marvellous and ineffable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, she ascribes divine attributes to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because of it, on the one hand, she does not deny that Man, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, came down from heaven, on the other, she believes that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as Man, was created, suffered, and was crucified on earth; because of it, finally, she confesses Man the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and God the Son of the Virgin.</p>

<p>Blessed, then, and venerable, blessed and most sacred, and altogether worthy to be compared with those celestial praises of the Angelic Host, be the confession which ascribes <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the one Lord God with a threefold ascription of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. For this reason moreover she insists emphatically upon the oneness of the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that she may not go beyond the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Trinity (that is by making in effect a Quaternity.)</p>

<p>Thus much by way of digression. On another occasion, please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we will deal with the subject and unfold it more fully.  Now let us return to the matter in hand.</p>
<h2>Chapter 17.</h2>

<p><strong>The Error of Origen a great Trial to the Church.</strong></p>

<p>[42.] We said above that in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> the teacher's <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is the people's trial, a trial by so much the greater in proportion to the greater learning of the erring teacher. This we showed first by the authority of Scripture, and then by instances from Church History, of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who having at one time had the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of being sound in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, eventually either fell away to some <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> already in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, or else founded a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of their own. An important fact <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, useful to be learned, and necessary to be remembered, and to be illustrated and enforced again and again, by example upon example, in order that all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> may understand that it behooves them with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to receive Teachers, not with Teachers to desert the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>[43.] My belief is, that among many instances of this sort of trial which might be produced, there is not one to be compared with that of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>,  in whom there were many things so excellent, so unique, so admirable, that antecedently any one would readily deem that implicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was to be placed all his assertions. For if the conversation and manner of life carry authority, great was his industry, great his modesty, his patience, his endurance; if his descent or his erudition, what more noble than his birth of a house rendered illustrious by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>? Afterwards, when in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Christ he had been deprived not only of his father, but also of all his property, he attained so high a standard in the midst of the straits of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> poverty, that he suffered several times, it is said, as a Confessor. Nor were these the only circumstances connected with him, all of which afterwards <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> an occasion of trial. He had a genius so powerful, so profound, so acute, so elegant, that there was hardly any one whom he did not very far surpass. The splendour of his learning, and of his erudition generally, was such that there were few points of divine <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, hardly any of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> which he did not thoroughly master. When Greek had yielded to his industry, he made himself a proficient in Hebrew. What shall I say of his eloquence, the style of which was so charming, so soft, so sweet, that honey rather than words seemed to flow from his mouth! What subjects were there, however difficult, which he did not render clear and perspicuous by the force of his reasoning? What undertakings, however hard to accomplish, which he did not make to appear most easy? But perhaps his assertions rested simply on ingeniously woven argumentation? On the contrary, no teacher ever used more <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> drawn from Scripture. Then I suppose he wrote little? No man more, so that, if I mistake not, his writings not only cannot all be read through, they cannot all be found;  for that nothing might be wanting to his opportunities of obtaining <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he had the additional advantage of a life greatly prolonged.  But perhaps he was not particularly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>? Who ever more so? From his school came forth doctors, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, confessors, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, without number.  Then who can express how much he was admired by all, how great his renown, how wide his influence? Who was there whose religion was at all above the common standard that did not hasten to him from the ends of the earth? What <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> did not reverence him almost as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; what <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> as a master? How great was the veneration with which he was regarded, not only by private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but also by the Court, is declared by the histories which relate how he was sent for by the mother of the Emperor Alexander,  moved by the heavenly wisdom with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of which she, as he, was inflamed. To this also his letters bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, which, with the authority which he assumed as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Teacher, he wrote to the Emperor Philip,  the first Roman prince that was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. As to his incredible learning, if any one is unwilling to receive the testimony of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at our hands, let him at least accept that of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> at the hands of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. For that impious Porphyry says that when he was little more than a boy, incited by his fame, he went to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, and there saw him, then an old man, but a man evidently of so great attainments, that he had reached the summit of universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>[44.] Time would fail me to recount, even in a very small measure, the excellencies of this man, all of which, nevertheless, not only contributed to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of religion, but also increased the magnitude of the trial. For who in the world would lightly desert a man of so great genius, so great learning, so great influence, and would not rather adopt that saying, That he would rather be wrong with <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, than be right with others. </p>

<p>What shall I say more? The result was that very many were led astray from the integrity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not by any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> excellencies of this so great man, this so great doctor, this so great <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, but, as the event showed, by the too perilous trial which he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be. Hence it came to pass, that this <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, such and so great as he was, wantonly abusing the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, rashly following the bent of his own genius, and placing overmuch confidence in himself, making light account of the ancient simplicity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, presuming that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> more than all the world besides, despising  the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the determinations of the ancients, and interpreting certain passages of Scripture in a novel way, deserved for himself the warning given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, as applicable in his case as in that of others, <q>If there arise a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the midst of you,</q>... <q>you shall not hearken to the words of that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>,</q>...<q>because the Lord your God does make trial of you, whether you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him or not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350488"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:1</a></span> Truly, thus of a sudden to seduce the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which was devoted to him, and hung upon him through admiration of his genius, his learning, his eloquence, his manner of life and influence, while she had no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, no suspicion for herself&mdash;thus, I say, to seduce the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, slowly and little by little, from the old religion to a new profaneness, was not only a trial, but a great trial. </p>

<p>[45.] But some one will say, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> books have been corrupted. I do not deny it; nay, I grant it readily. For that such is the case has been handed down both orally and in writing, not only by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as well. But the point is, that though himself be not, yet books published under his name are, a great trial, which, abounding in many hurtful <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, are both read and delighted in, not as being some one else's, but as being <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be his, so that, although there was no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> original meaning, yet <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> authority appears to be an effectual <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in leading people to embrace <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>
<h2>Chapter 18.</h2>

<p><strong>Tertullian a great Trial to the Church.</strong></p>

<p>[46.] The case is the same with <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>.  For as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> holds by far the first place among the Greeks, so does <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> among the Latins. For who more learned than he, who more versed in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whether divine or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>? With marvellous capacity of mind he comprehended all <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and had a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all schools of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and of the founders and upholders of schools, and was acquainted with all their rules and observances, and with their various histories and studies. Was not his genius of such unrivalled strength and vehemence that there was scarcely any obstacle which he proposed to himself to overcome, that he did not penetrate by acuteness, or crush by weight? As to his style, who can sufficiently set forth its praise? It was knit together with so much cogency of argument that it compelled assent, even where it failed to persuade. Every word almost was a sentence; every sentence a victory. This <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Marcions, the <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelleses</a>, the Praxeases, the Hermogeneses, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the Heathens, the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, and the rest, whose <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> he overthrew by the force of his many and ponderous volumes, as with so many thunderbolts. Yet this man also, notwithstanding all that I have mentioned, this <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, I say, too little tenacious of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine, that is, of the universal and ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, more eloquent by far than faithful,  changed his belief, and justified what the blessed Confessor, Hilary, writes of him, namely, that <q>by his subsequent <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> he detracted from the authority of his approved writings.</q>  He also was a great trial in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> I am unwilling to say more. This only I will add, that, contrary to the injunction of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, by asserting the novel furies of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>  which arose in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and those mad dreams of new doctrine dreamed by mad <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> prophecies, he deservedly made both himself and his writings obnoxious to the words, <q>If there arise a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the midst of you,</q>...you shall not hearken to the words of that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. For why? <q>Because the Lord your God does make trial of you, whether you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him or not.</q></p>
<h2>Chapter 19.</h2>

<p><strong>What we ought to learn from these Examples.</strong></p>

<p>[47.] It behooves us, then, to give heed to these instances from Church History, so many and so great, and others of the same description, and to understand distinctly, in accordance with the rule laid down in Deuteronomy, that if at any time a Doctor in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have erred from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> permits it in order to make trial of us, whether or not we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God with all our heart and with all our mind.</p>
<h2>Chapter 20.</h2>

<p><strong>The Notes of a true Catholic.</strong></p>

<p>[48.] This being the case, he is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and genuine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who loves the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who loves the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who loves the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who esteems divine religion and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith above every thing, above the authority, above the regard, above the genius, above the eloquence, above the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, of every man whatsoever; who sets light by all of these, and continuing steadfast and established in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, resolves that he will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, and that only, which he is sure the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has held universally and from ancient time; but that whatsoever new and unheard-of doctrine he shall find to have been furtively introduced by some one or another, besides that of all, or contrary to that of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, this, he will understand, does not pertain to religion, but is permitted as a trial, being instructed especially by the words of the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, who writes thus in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, <q>There must needs be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, that they who are approved may be made manifest among you:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350494"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> as though he should say, This is the reason why the authors of Heresies are not immediately rooted up by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, that they who are approved may be made manifest; that is, that it may be apparent of each individual, how tenacious and faithful and steadfast he is in his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>[49.] And in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as each novelty springs up incontinently is discerned the difference between the weight of the wheat and the lightness of the chaff. Then that which had no weight to keep it on the floor is without difficulty blown away. For some at once fly off entirely; others having been only shaken out, afraid of perishing, wounded, half alive, half dead, are ashamed to return. They have, in fact swallowed a quantity of poison&mdash; not enough to kill, yet more than can be got rid of; it neither causes death, nor suffers to live. O wretched condition! With what surging tempestuous cares are they tossed about! One while, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> being set in motion, they are hurried wherever the wind drives them; another, returning upon themselves like refluent waves, they are dashed back: one while, with rash presumption, they give their approval to what seems uncertain; another, with irrational <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, they are frightened out of their wits at what is certain, in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whither to go, whither to return, what to seek, what to shun, what to keep, what to throw away.</p>

<p>[50.] This affliction, indeed, of a hesitating and miserably vacillating mind is, if they are wise, a medicine intended for them by God's compassion. For therefore it is that outside the most secure harbour of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, they are tossed about, beaten, and almost killed, by various tempestuous cogitations, in order that they may take in the sails of self-conceit, which, they had with ill advice unfurled to the blasts of novelty, and may betake themselves again to, and remain stationary within, the most secure harbour of their placid and good mother, and may begin by vomiting up those bitter and turbid floods of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which they had swallowed, that thenceforward they may be able to drink the streams of fresh and living water. Let them unlearn well what they had learned not well, and let them receive so much of the entire doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as they can understand: what they cannot understand let them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>
<h2>Chapter 21.</h2>

<p><strong>Exposition of St. Paul's Words.&mdash; <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1 Tim. vi. 20</a>.</strong></p>

<p>[51.] Such being the case, when I think over these things, and revolve them in my mind again and again, I cannot sufficiently wonder at the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of certain men, at the impiety of their blinded understanding, at their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, such that, not content with the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> delivered once for all, and received from the times of old, they are every day seeking one novelty after another, and are constantly longing to add, change, take away, in religion, as though the doctrine, <q>Let what has once for all been revealed suffice,</q> were not a heavenly but an earthly rule&mdash;a rule which could not be complied with except by continual emendation, nay, rather by continual fault-finding; whereas the divine Oracles cry aloud, <q>Remove not the landmarks, which your fathers have set,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350495"><a href="../bible/pro022.htm#verse28">Proverbs&nbsp;22:28</a></span> and <q>Go not to law with a Judge,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350496"><a href="../bible/sir008.htm#verse14">Sirach&nbsp;8:14</a></span> and <q>Whoso breaks through a fence a serpent shall bite him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350497"><a href="../bible/ecc010.htm#verse8">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;10:8</a></span> and that saying of the Apostle wherewith, as with a spiritual sword, all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> novelties of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> often have been, and will always have to be, decapitated, <q>O Timothy, keep the deposit, shunning profane novelties of words and oppositions of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called, which some professing have erred concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350498"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:20</a></span> </p>

<p>[52.] After words such as these, is there any one of so hardened a front, such anvil-like impudence, such adamantine pertinacity, as not to succumb to so huge a mass, not to be crushed by so ponderous a weight, not to be shaken in pieces by such heavy blows, not to be annihilated by such dreadful thunderbolts of divine eloquence? <q>Shun profane novelties,</q> he says. He does not say shun <q>antiquity.</q> But he plainly points to what ought to follow by the rule of contrary. For if novelty is to be shunned, antiquity is to be held fast; if novelty is profane, antiquity is sacred. He adds, <q>And oppositions of science <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called.</q> <q>Falsely called</q> indeed, as applied to the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, where <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is disguised under the name of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, fog of sunshine, darkness of light. <q>Which some professing have erred concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> Professing what?

But learn it by stealth and in secret, for you will be delighted with it. Moreover, when you have learned it, teach it furtively, that the world may not hear, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.

That which has been entrusted to you, not that which you have yourself devised: a matter not of wit, but of learning; not of private adoption, but of public tradition; a matter brought to you, not put forth by you, wherein you are bound to be not an author but a keeper, not a teacher but a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, not a leader but a follower. <q>Keep the deposit.</q> Preserve the talent of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith inviolate, unadulterate. That which has been entrusted to you, let it continue in your possession, let it be handed on by you. You have received gold; give gold in turn. Do not substitute one thing for another. Do not for gold impudently substitute lead or brass. Give real gold, not counterfeit.</p>

<p>O Timothy! O Priest! O Expositor! O Doctor! If the divine gift has qualified you by wit, by skill, by learning, be a Bazaleel of the spiritual tabernacle,  engrave the precious gems of divine doctrine, fit them in accurately, adorn them skilfully, add splendor, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, beauty. Let that which formerly was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, though imperfectly apprehended, as expounded by you be clearly understood. Let posterity welcome, understood through your exposition, what antiquity venerated without understanding. Yet teach still the same truths which you have learned, so that though you speak after a new fashion, what you speak may not be new.</p>
<h2>Chapter 23.</h2>

<p><strong>On Development in Religious Knowledge.</strong></p>

<p>[54.] But some one will say, perhaps, Shall there, then, be no progress in Christ's Church? Certainly; all possible progress. For what being is there, so <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so full of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who would seek to forbid it? Yet on condition that it be real progress, not alteration of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For progress requires that the subject be enlarged n itself, alteration, that it be transformed into something else. The intelligence, then, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the wisdom, as well of individuals as of all, as well of one man as of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, ought, in the course of ages and centuries, to increase and make much and vigorous progress; but yet only in its own kind; that is to say, in the same doctrine, in the same sense, and in the same meaning.</p>

<p>[55.] The growth of religion in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must be analogous to the growth of the body, which, though in process of years it is developed and attains its full size, yet remains still the same. There is a wide difference between the flower of youth and the maturity of age; yet they who were once young are still the same now that they have become old, insomuch that though the stature and outward form of the individual are changed, yet his nature is one and the same, his person is one and the same. An infant's limbs are small, a young man's large, yet the infant and the young man are the same. Men when full grown have the same number of joints that they had when children; and if there be any to which maturer age has given birth these were already present in embryo, so that nothing new is produced in them when old which was not already latent in them when children. This, then, is undoubtedly the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and legitimate rule of progress, this the established and most beautiful order of growth, that mature age ever develops in the man those parts and forms which the wisdom of the Creator had already framed beforehand in the infant. Whereas, if the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form were changed into some shape belonging to another kind, or at any rate, if the number of its limbs were increased or diminished, the result would be that the whole body would become either a wreck or a monster, or, at the least, would be impaired and enfeebled.</p>

<p>[56.] In like manner, it behooves <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine to follow the same <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of progress, so as to be consolidated by years, enlarged by time, refined by age, and yet, withal, to continue uncorrupt and unadulterate, complete and perfect in all the measurement of its parts, and, so to speak, in all its proper members and senses, admitting no change, no waste of its distinctive property, no variation in its limits.</p>

<p>[57.] For example: Our forefathers in the old time sowed wheat in the Church's field. It would be most unmeet and iniquitous if we, their descendants, instead of the genuine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of grain, should reap the counterfeit <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of tares. This rather should be the result&mdash;there should be no discrepancy between the first and the last. From doctrine which was sown as wheat, we should reap, in the increase, doctrine of the same kind&mdash; wheat also; so that when in process of time any of the original seed is developed, and now flourishes under cultivation, no change may ensue in the character of the plant. There may supervene shape, form, variation in outward appearance, but the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of each kind must remain the same. God forbid that those rose-beds of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interpretation should be converted into thorns and thistles. God forbid that in that spiritual paradise from plants of cinnamon and balsam, darnel and wolfsbane should of a sudden shoot forth.</p>

<p>Therefore, whatever has been sown by the fidelity of the Fathers in this husbandry of God's Church, the same ought to be cultivated and taken care of by the industry of their children, the same ought to flourish and ripen, the same ought to advance and go forward to perfection. For it is right that those ancient doctrines of heavenly <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> should, as time goes on, be cared for, smoothed, polished; but not that they should be changed, not that they should be maimed, not that they should be mutilated. They may receive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, illustration, definiteness; but they must retain withal their completeness, their integrity, their characteristic properties.</p>

<p>[58.] For if once this license of impious fraud be admitted, I dread to say in how great danger religion will be of being utterly destroyed and annihilated. For if any one part of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be given up, another, and another, and another will thenceforward be given up as a matter of course, and the several individual portions having been rejected, what will follow in the end but the rejection of the whole? On the other hand, if what is new begins to be mingled with what is old, foreign with domestic, profane with sacred, the custom will of necessity creep on universally, till at last the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> will have nothing left untampered with, nothing unadulterated, nothing sound, nothing pure; but where formerly there was a sanctuary of chaste and undefiled <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, thenceforward there will be a brothel of impious and base <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. May God's mercy avert this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> from the minds of his servants; be it rather the frenzy of the ungodly.</p>

<p>[59.] But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the careful and watchful guardian of the doctrines deposited in her charge, never changes anything in them, never diminishes, never adds, does not cut off what is necessary, does not add what is superfluous, does not lose her own, does not appropriate what is another's, but while dealing faithfully and judiciously with ancient doctrine, keeps this one object carefully in view&mdash;if there be anything which antiquity has left shapeless and rudimentary, to fashion and polish it, if anything already reduced to shape and developed, to consolidate and strengthen it, if any already ratified and defined, to keep and guard it. Finally, what other object have Councils ever aimed at in their decrees, than to provide that what was before <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in simplicity should in future be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> intelligently, that what was before preached coldly should in future be preached earnestly, that what was before practised negligently should thenceforward be practised with double solicitude? This, I say, is what the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, roused by the novelties of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, has accomplished by the decrees of her Councils,&mdash; this, and nothing else&mdash;she has thenceforward consigned to posterity in writing what she had received from those of olden times only by tradition, comprising a great amount of matter in a few words, and often, for the better understanding, designating an old article of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the characteristic of a new name. </p>

<p><strong>Continuation of the Exposition of <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1 Tim. vi. 20</a>.</strong></p>

<p>[60.] But let us return to the apostle. <q>O Timothy,</q> he says, <q>Guard the deposit, shunning profane novelties of words.</q> <q>Shun them as you would a viper, as you would a scorpion, as you would a basilisk, lest they smite you not only with their touch, but even with their eyes and breath.</q> What is <q>to shun</q>? Not even to eat <span class="stiki" id="note350502"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:11</a></span> with a person of this sort. What is <q>shun</q>? <q>If anyone,</q> says St. John, come to you and bring not this doctrine. What doctrine? What but the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and universal doctrine, which has continued one and the same through the several successions of ages by the uncorrupt tradition of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and so will continue for ever&mdash; <q>Receive him not into your house, neither bid him Godspeed, for he that bids him Godspeed communicates with him in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350503"><a href="../bible/2jo001.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;John&nbsp;10</a></span> </p>

<p>[61.] <q>Profane novelties of words.</q> What words are these? Such as have nothing sacred, nothing religious, words utterly remote from the inmost sanctuary of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Profane novelties of words, that is, of doctrines, subjects, opinions, such as are contrary to antiquity and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the olden time. Which if they be received, it follows necessarily that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the blessed fathers is violated either in whole, or at all events in great part; it follows necessarily that all the faithful of all ages, all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the chaste, the continent, the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, Deacons and Priests, so many thousands of Confessors, so vast an army of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, such multitudes of cities and of peoples, so many islands, provinces, kings, tribes, kingdoms, nations, in a word, almost the whole earth, incorporated in Christ the Head, through the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> for so long a tract of time, have been mistaken, have <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, what to confess.</p>

<p>[62.] <q>Shun profane novelties of words,</q> which to receive and follow was never the part of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> always was. In truth, what <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> ever burst forth save under a definite name, at a definite place, at a definite time? Who ever originated a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> that did not first dissever himself from the consentient agreement of the universality and antiquity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? That this is so is demonstrated in the clearest way by examples. For who ever before that profane Pelagius  attributed so much antecedent strength to Free-will, as to deny the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to aid it towards good in every single act? Who ever before his monstrous <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> C&oelig;lestius denied that the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is involved in the guilt of Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Who ever before <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> dared to rend asunder the unity of the Trinity? Who before impious Sabellius was so audacious as to confound the Trinity of the Unity? Who before cruellest <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> represented God as cruel in that He had rather the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> should die than that he should be converted and live? Who before <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, who was smitten by the apostle's rebuke, and from whom that ancient sink of every thing vile has flowed by a secret continuous succession even to Priscillian of our own time,&mdash; who, I say, before this <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, dared to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator, is the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that is, of our wickednesses, impieties, flagitiousnesses, inasmuch as he asserts that He created with His own hands a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of such a description, that of its own motion, and by the impulse of its necessity-constrained will, it can do nothing else, can will nothing else, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, seeing that tossed to and fro, and set on fire by the furies of all sorts of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, it is hurried away by unquenchable <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> into the utmost extremes of baseness?</p>

<p>[63.] There are innumerable instances of this kind, which for brevity's sake, pass over; by all of which, however, it is manifestly and clearly shown, that it is an established law, in the case of almost all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, that they evermore delight in profane novelties, scorn the decisions of antiquity, and, through oppositions of science <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called, make shipwreck of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. On the other hand, it is the sure characteristic of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to keep that which has been committed to their trust by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, to condemn profane novelties, and, in the apostle's words, once and again repeated, to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> every one who preaches any other doctrine than that which has been received. <span class="stiki" id="note350505"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> </p>
<h2>Chapter 25.</h2>

<p><strong>Heretics appeal to Scripture that they may more easily succeed in deceiving.</strong></p>

<p>[64.] Here, possibly, some one may ask, Do <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> also appeal to Scripture? They do indeed, and with a vengeance; for you may see them scamper through every single book of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>&mdash;through the books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the books of Kings, the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, the Epistles, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, the Prophets. Whether among their own people, or among strangers, in private or in public, in speaking or in writing, at convivial meetings, or in the streets, hardly ever do they bring forward anything of their own which they do not endeavour to shelter under words of Scripture. Read the works of <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>, of Priscillian, of Eunomius, of Jovinian, and the rest of those pests, and you will see an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> heap of instances, hardly a single page, which does not bristle with plausible quotations from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> or the Old.</p>

<p>[65.] But the more secretly they conceal themselves under shelter of the Divine Law, so much the more are they to be feared and guarded against. For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> stench of their doctrine will hardly find acceptance with any one if it be exhaled pure and simple. They sprinkle it over, therefore, with the perfume of heavenly language, in order that one who would be ready to despise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, may hesitate to condemn divine words. They do, in fact, what nurses do when they would prepare some bitter draught for children; they smear the edge of the cup all round with honey, that the unsuspecting child, having first tasted the sweet, may have no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the bitter. So too do these act, who disguise poisonous herbs and noxious juices under the names of medicines, so that no one almost, when he reads the label, suspects the poison.</p>

<p>[66.] It was for this reason that the Saviour cried, <q>Beware of <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350506"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;7:15</a></span> What is meant by <q>sheep's clothing</q>? What but the words which <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> with the guilelessness of sheep wove beforehand as fleeces, for that immaculate Lamb which takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world? What are the ravening wolves? What but the savage and rabid glosses of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who continually infest the Church's folds, and tear in pieces the flock of Christ wherever they are able? But that they may with more successful guile steal upon the unsuspecting sheep, retaining the ferocity of the wolf, they put off his appearance, and wrap themselves, so to say, in the language of the Divine Law, as in a fleece, so that one, having felt the softness of wool, may have no dread of the wolf's fangs. But what says the Saviour? <q>By their fruits you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them;</q> that is, when they have begun not only to quote those divine words, but also to expound them, not as yet only to make a boast of them as on their side, but also to interpret them, then will that bitterness, that acerbity, that rage, be understood; then will the ill-savour of that novel poison be perceived, then will those profane novelties be disclosed, then may you see first the hedge broken through, then the landmarks of the Fathers removed, then the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> assailed, then the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> torn in pieces.</p>

<p>[67.] Such were they whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> rebukes in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, when he says, <q>For of this sort are false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350507"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:12</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> brought forward instances from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>; these men did the same. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> cited the authority of the Psalms; these men did so likewise. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> brought forward passages from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; these men still did the same. But when they began to interpret in different senses the passages which both had agreed in appealing to, then were discerned the guileless from the crafty, the genuine from the counterfeit, the straight from the crooked, then, in one word, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> from the false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. <q>And no wonder,</q> he says, <q>for <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> himself transforms himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light. It is no marvel then if his servants are transformed as the servants of righteousness.</q> Therefore, according to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, as often as either false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> or false teachers cite passages from the Divine Law, by means of which, misinterpreted, they seek to prop up their own <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they are following the cunning devices of their father, which assuredly he would never have devised, but that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that where he could fraudulently and by stealth introduce <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, there is no easier way of effecting his impious purpose than by pretending the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Heretics, in quoting Scripture, follow the example of the Devil.</strong></p>

<p>[68.] But some one will say, What <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> have we that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> is wont to appeal to <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>?

For as then the Head spoke to the Head, so now also the members speak to the members, the members of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> to the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, misbelievers to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> to religious, in one word, Heretics to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</p>

<p>[69.] But what do they say? <q>If you be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, cast yourself down;</q> that is, If you would be a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, and would receive the inheritance of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, cast yourself down; that is, cast yourself down from the doctrine and tradition of that sublime Church, which is imagined to be nothing less than the very temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

For they dare to teach and promise, that in their church, that is, in the conventicle of their communion, there is a certain great and special and altogether personal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that whosoever pertain to their number, without any labour, without any effort, without any industry, even though they neither ask, nor seek, nor knock, have such a dispensation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that, borne up by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> hands, that is, preserved by the protection of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, it is impossible they should ever dash their feet against a stone, that is, that they should ever be offended. </p>
<h2>Chapter 27.</h2>

<p><strong>What Rule is to be observed in the Interpretation of Scripture.</strong></p>

<p>[70.] But it will be said, If the words, the sentiments, the promises of Scripture, are appealed to by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, of whom some are false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, some <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> and false teachers, and all without exception <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, what are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the sons of Mother Church to do? How are they to distinguish <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> in the sacred Scriptures? They must be very careful to pursue that course which, in the beginning of this Commonitory, we said that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and learned men had commended to us, that is to say, they must interpret the sacred Canon according to the traditions of the Universal Church and in keeping with the rules of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine, in which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Universal Church, moreover, they must follow universality, antiquity, consent. And if at any time a part opposes itself to the whole, novelty to antiquity, the dissent of one or a few who are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to the consent of all or at all events of the great majority of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, then they must prefer the soundness of the whole to the corruption of a part; in which same whole they must prefer the religion of antiquity to the profaneness of novelty; and in antiquity itself in like manner, to the temerity of one or of a very few they must prefer, first of all, the general decrees, if such there be, of a Universal Council, or if there be no such, then, what is next best, they must follow the consentient belief of many and great masters. Which rule having been faithfully, soberly, and scrupulously observed, we shall with little difficulty detect the noxious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as they arise.</p>
<h2>Chapter 28.</h2>

<p><strong>In what Way, on collating the consentient opinions of the Ancient Masters, the Novelties of Heretics may be detected and condemned.</strong></p>

<p>[71.] And here I perceive that, as a necessary sequel to the foregoing, I ought to show by examples in what way, by collating the consentient opinions of the ancient masters, the profane novelties of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> may be detected and condemned. Yet in the investigation of this ancient consent of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers we are to bestow our pains not on every minor question of the Divine Law, but only, at all events especially, where the Rule of Faith is concerned. Nor is this way of dealing with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to be resorted to always, or in every instance, but only in the case of those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which are new and recent, and that on their first arising, before they have had time to deprave the Rules of the Ancient Faith, and before they endeavour, while the poison spreads and diffuses itself, to corrupt the writings of the ancients. But <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> already widely diffused and of old standing are by no means to be thus dealt with, seeing that through lapse of time they have long had opportunity of corrupting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And therefore, as to the more ancient schisms or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, we ought either to confute them, if need be, by the sole authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, or at any rate, to shun them as having been already of old convicted and condemned by universal councils of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Priesthood.</p>

<p>[72.] Therefore, as soon as the corruption of each mischievous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> begins to break forth, and to defend itself by filching certain passages of Scripture, and expounding them fraudulently and deceitfully, immediately, the opinions of the ancients in the interpretation of the Canon are to be collected, whereby the novelty, and consequently the profaneness, whatever it may be, that arises, may both without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> be exposed, and without any tergiversation be condemned. But the opinions of those Fathers only are to be used for comparison, who living and teaching, holily, wisely, and with constancy, in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and communion, were counted worthy either to die in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or to suffer death happily for Christ. Whom yet we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in this condition, that that only is to be accounted indubitable, certain, established, which either all, or the more part, have supported and confirmed manifestly, frequently, persistently, in one and the same sense, forming, as it were, a consentient council of doctors, all receiving, holding, handing on the same doctrine. But whatsoever a teacher holds, other than all, or contrary to all, be he <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and learned, be he a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, be he a Confessor, be he a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, let that be regarded as a private fancy of his own, and be separated from the authority of common, public, general persuasion, lest, after the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> custom of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, rejecting the ancient <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the universal Creed, we follow, at the utmost peril of our <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the newly devised <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of one man.</p>

<p>[73.] Lest any one perchance should rashly think the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> consent of these blessed fathers to be despised, the Apostle says, in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has placed some in the Church, first Apostles,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350510"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:27-28</a></span> of whom himself was one; <q>secondly Prophets,</q> such as <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a>, of whom we read in the Acts of the Apostles; <span class="stiki" id="note350511"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;11:28</a></span> <q>then doctors,</q> who are now called Homilists, Expositors,  whom the same apostle sometimes calls also <q>Prophets,</q> because by them the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Prophets are opened to the people. Whosoever, therefore, shall despise these, who had their appointment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His Church in their several times and places, when they are unanimous in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in the interpretation of some one point of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine, despises not man, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from whose unity in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, lest any one should vary, the same Apostle earnestly protests, <q>I beseech you, brethren, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350513"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:10</a></span> But if any one dissent from their unanimous decision, let him listen to the words of the same apostle, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of dissension but of peace;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350514"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse33">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:33</a></span> that is, not of him who departs from the unity of consent, but of those who remain steadfast in the peace of consent: <q>as,</q> he continues, <q>I teach in all Churches of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>,</q> that is, of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, which churches are therefore churches of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, because they continue steadfast in the communion of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>[74.] And lest any one, disregarding every one else, should arrogantly claim to be listened to himself alone, himself alone to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, the Apostle goes on to say, <q>Did the word of God proceed from you, or did it come to you only?</q> And, lest this should be thought lightly spoken, he continues, <q>If any man seem to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or a spiritual person, let him acknowledge that the things which I write unto you are the Lord's commands.</q> As to which, unless a man be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or a spiritual person, that is, a master in spiritual matters, let him be as observant as possible of impartiality and unity, so as neither to prefer his own opinions to those of every one besides, nor to recede from the belief of the whole body. Which injunction, whoso ignores, shall be himself ignored; <span class="stiki" id="note350515"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse33">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:33</a></span> that is, he who either does not learn what he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, or treats with contempt what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, shall be ignored, that is, shall be deemed unworthy to be ranked of God with those who are united to each other by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and equalled with each other by humility, than which I cannot <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a more terrible <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. This it is however which, according to the Apostle's threatening, we see to have befallen Julian the Pelagian,  who either neglected to associate himself with the belief of his fellow <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, or presumed to dissociate himself from it.</p>

<p>[75.] But it is now time to bring forward the exemplification which we promised, where and how the sentences of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers have been collected together, so that in accordance with them, by the decree and authority of a council, the rule of the Church's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be settled. Which that it may be done the more conveniently, let this present Commonitory end here, so that the remainder which is to follow may be begun from a fresh beginning.</p>

<p>[The Second Book of the Commonitory is lost. Nothing of it remains but the conclusion: in other words, the recapitulation which follows.]</p>
<h2>Chapter 29.</h2>

<p><strong>Recapitulation.</strong></p>

<p>[76.] This being the case, it is now time that we should recapitulate, at the close of this second Commonitory, what was said in that and in the preceding.</p>

<p>We said above, that it has always been the custom of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and still is, to prove the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in these two ways; first by the authority of the Divine Canon, and next by the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Not that the Canon alone does not of itself suffice for every question, but seeing that the more part, interpreting the divine words according to their own persuasion, take up various erroneous opinions, it is therefore necessary that the interpretation of <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> should be ruled according to the one standard of the Church's belief, especially in those articles on which the foundations of all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine rest.</p>

<p>[77.] We said likewise, that in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself regard must be had to the consentient voice of universality equally with that of antiquity, lest we either be torn from the integrity of unity and carried away to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, or be precipitated from the religion of antiquity into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> novelties. We said, further, that in this same <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> antiquity two points are very carefully and earnestly to be held in view by those who would keep clear of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>: first, they should ascertain whether any decision has been given in ancient times as to the matter in question by the whole <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, with the authority of a General Council: and, secondly, if some new question should arise on which no such decision has been given, they should then have recourse to the opinions of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, of those at least, who, each in his own time and place, remaining in the unity of communion and of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, were accepted as approved masters; and whatsoever these may be found to have held, with one mind and with one consent, this ought to be accounted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or scruple.</p>

<p>[78.] Which lest we should seem to allege presumptuously on our own warrant rather than on the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we appealed to the example of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council which some three years ago was held at Ephesus  in Asia, in the consulship of Bassus and Antiochus, where, when question was raised as to the authoritative determining of rules of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, lest, perchance, any profane novelty should creep in, as did the perversion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> at Ariminum,  the whole body of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> there assembled, nearly two hundred in number, approved of this as the most <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, the most trustworthy, and the best course, viz., to bring forth into the midst the sentiments of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, some of whom it was well known had been <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, some Confessors, but all had been, and continued to the end to be, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, in order that by their consentient determination the reverence due to ancient <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might be duly and solemnly confirmed, and the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of profane novelty condemned. Which having been done, that impious <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> was lawfully and deservedly adjudged to be opposed to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> antiquity, and contrariwise blessed Cyril to be in agreement with it. And that nothing might be wanting to the credibility of the matter, we recorded the names and the number (though we had forgotten the order) of the Fathers, according to whose consentient and unanimous judgment, both the sacred preliminaries of judicial procedure were expounded, and the rule of divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> established. Whom, that we may strengthen our memory, it will be no superfluous labour to mention again here also.</p>
<h2>Chapter 30.</h2>

<p><strong>The Council of Ephesus.</strong></p>

<p>[79.] These then are the men whose writings, whether as judges or as witnesses, were recited in the Council: St. Peter, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, a most excellent Doctor and most blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, Saint Athanasius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the same city, a most faithful Teacher, and most eminent Confessor, Saint Theophilus, also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the same city, a man illustrious for his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, his life, his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whose successor, the revered Cyril, now  adorns the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> Church. And lest perchance the doctrine ratified by the Council should be thought peculiar to one city and province, there were added also those lights of Cappadocia, St. Gregory of Nazianzus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and Confessor, St. Basil of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and Confessor, and the other St. Gregory, St. Gregory of Nyssa, for his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, his conversation, his integrity, and his wisdom, most worthy to be the brother of Basil. And lest Greece or the East should seem to stand alone, to prove that the Western and Latin world also have always held the same belief, there were read in the Council certain Epistles of St. Felix, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and St. Julius, both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Rome. And that not only the Head, but the other parts, of the world also might bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the judgment of the council, there was added from the South the most blessed Cyprian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and from the North St. Ambrose, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Milan.</p>

<p>[80.] These all then, to the sacred number of the decalogue,  were produced at Ephesus as doctors, councillors, witnesses, judges. And that blessed council holding their doctrine, following their counsel, believing their <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, submitting to their judgment without haste, without foregone conclusion, without partiality, gave their determination concerning the Rules of Faith. A much greater number of the ancients might have been adduced; but it was needless, because neither was it fit that the time should be occupied by a multitude of witnesses, nor does any one suppose that those ten were really of a different mind from the rest of their colleagues.</p>
<h2>Chapter 31.</h2>

<p><strong>The Constancy of the Ephesine Fathers in driving away Novelty and maintaining Antiquity.</strong></p>

<p>[81.] After the preceding we added also the sentence of blessed Cyril, which is contained in these same Ecclesiastical Proceedings. For when the Epistle of Capreolus,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, had been read, wherein he earnestly intreats that novelty may be driven away and antiquity maintained, Cyril made and carried the proposal, which it may not be out of place to insert here: For says he, at the close of the proceedings, <q>Let the Epistle of Capreolus also, the reverend and very religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, which has been read, be inserted in the acts. His mind is obvious, for he intreats that the doctrines of the ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be confirmed, such as are novel, wantonly devised, and impiously promulgated, reprobated and condemned.</q> All the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out, <q>These are the words of all; this we all say, this we all desire.</q> What mean <q>the words of all,</q> what mean <q>the desires of all,</q> but that what has been handed down from antiquity should be retained, what has been newly devised, rejected with disdain?</p>

<p>[82.] Next we expressed our admiration of the humility and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of that Council, such that, though the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was so great, almost the more part of them metropolitans, so erudite, so learned, that almost all were capable of taking part in doctrinal discussions, whom the very circumstance of their being assembled for the purpose, might seem to embolden to make some determination on their own authority, yet they innovated nothing, presumed nothing, arrogated to themselves absolutely nothing, but used all possible care to hand down nothing to posterity but what they had themselves received from their Fathers. And not only did they dispose satisfactorily of the matter presently in hand, but they also set an example to those who should come after them, how they also should adhere to the determinations of sacred antiquity, and condemn the devices of profane novelty.</p>

<p>[83.] We inveighed also against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> presumption of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> in boasting that he was the first and the only one who understood <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, and that all those teachers were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, who before him had expounded the sacred oracles, forsooth, the whole body of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the whole body of Confessors and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, of whom some had published commentaries upon the Law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, others had agreed with them in their comments, or had acquiesced in them. In a word, he confidently asserted that the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was even now in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and always had been in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, in that, as it seemed to him, it had followed, and was following, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and misguided teachers.</p>
<h2>Chapter 32.</h2>

<p><strong>The zeal of Celestine and Sixtus, bishops of Rome, in opposing Novelty.</strong></p>

<p>[84.] The foregoing would be enough and very much more than enough, to crush and annihilate every profane novelty. But yet that nothing might be wanting to such completeness of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, we added, at the close, the twofold authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, first, that of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope Sixtus, the venerable prelate who now adorns the Roman Church; and secondly that of his predecessor, Pope Celestine of blessed memory, which same we think it necessary to insert here also.</p>

<p>Holy Pope Sixtus  then says in an Epistle which he wrote on <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius's</a> matter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <q>Therefore, because, as the Apostle says, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is one&mdash;evidently the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which has obtained hitherto&mdash;let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the things that are to be said, and say the things that are to be held.</q> What are the things that are to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and to be said? He goes on: <q>Let no license be allowed to novelty, because it is not fit that any addition should be made to antiquity. Let not the clear <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and belief of our forefathers be fouled by any muddy admixture.</q> A <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> apostolic sentiment! He enhances the belief of the Fathers by the epithet of clearness; profane novelties he calls muddy.</p>

<p>[85.] Holy Pope Celestine also expresses himself in like manner and to the same effect. For in the Epistle which he wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, charging them with connivance with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, in that by their silence they failed in their duty to the ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and allowed profane novelties to spring up, he says: <q>We are deservedly to blame if we encourage <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by silence. Therefore rebuke these people. Restrain their liberty of preaching.</q> But here some one may <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> who they are whose liberty to preach as they list he forbids&mdash;the preachers of antiquity or the devisers of novelty. Let himself tell us; let himself resolve the reader's <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. For he goes on: <q>If the case be so (that is, if the case be so as certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> complain to me touching your cities and provinces, that by your hurtful dissimulation you <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to consent to certain novelties), if the case be so, let novelty cease to assail antiquity.</q> This, then, was the sentence of blessed Celestine, not that antiquity should cease to subvert novelty, but that novelty should cease to assail antiquity. </p>
<h2>Chapter 33.</h2>

<p><strong>The Children of the Catholic Church ought to adhere to the Faith of their Fathers and die for it.</strong></p>

<p>[86.] Whoever then gainsays these Apostolic and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> determinations, first of all necessarily insults the memory of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Celestine, who decreed that novelty should cease to assail antiquity; and in the next place sets at naught the decision of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Sixtus, whose sentence was, <q>Let no license be allowed to novelty, since it is not fit that any addition be made to antiquity;</q> moreover, he condemns the determination of blessed Cyril, who extolled with high praise the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the venerable Capreolus, in that he would fain have the ancient doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> confirmed, and novel inventions condemned; yet more, he tramples upon the Council of Ephesus, that is, on the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of almost the whole East, who decreed, under divine guidance, that nothing ought to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by posterity save what the sacred antiquity of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, consentient in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, had held, who with one voice, and with loud acclaim, testified that these were the words of all, this was the wish of all, this was the sentence of all, that as almost all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> before <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, despising antiquity and upholding novelty, had been condemned, so <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, the author of novelty and the assailant of antiquity, should be condemned also. Whose consentient determination, inspired by the gift of sacred and celestial <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whoever disapproves must needs hold the profaneness of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> to have been condemned <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>; finally, he despises as vile and worthless the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and its doctors, <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and especially the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>: he despises the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in that she has never failed in loyalty to the duty of cherishing and preserving the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> once for all delivered to her; he despises St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who wrote, <q>O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you, shunning profane novelties of words;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350524"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:20</a></span> and again, <q>if any man preach unto you other than you have received, let him be accursed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350525"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;1:9</a></span> But if neither <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> injunctions nor <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> decrees may be violated, by which, in accordance with the sacred consent of universality and antiquity, all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> always, and, last of all, Pelagius, C&oelig;lestius, and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> have been rightly and deservedly condemned, then assuredly it is incumbent on all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who are anxious to approve themselves genuine sons of Mother Church, to adhere henceforward to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, to be wedded to it, to die in it; but as to the profane novelties of profane men&mdash; to detest them, abhor them, oppose them, give them no quarter.</p>

<p>[87.] These matters, handled more at large in the two preceding Commonitories, I have now put together more briefly by way of recapitulation, in order that my memory, to aid which I composed them, may, on the one hand, be refreshed by frequent reference, and, on the other, may avoid being wearied by prolixity.</p>
