<h1>Concerning Lowliness of Mind</h1>

<p class="stiki">There is an allusion at the beginning of this Homily to some remarks recently made on the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican. These occur in Chrysostom's fifth Homily against the Anom&aelig;ans, one of a set of Homilies which, from internal evidence, may be assigned to the close of the year 386, or beginning of 387. The following homily therefore was delivered at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, probably just before Christmas 386. There were some persons who explained the words of St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> cited in the title as signifying that provided Christ was preached it mattered not whether the actual doctrines taught were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. The main object of the homily is to vindicate the language of the Apostle from this erroneous and mischievous interpretation.</p>

<p> 1. When lately we made mention of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, and hypothetically yoked two chariots out of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>;  we pointed out each <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, how great is the gain of humbleness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and how great the damage of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For this, even when conjoined with righteousness and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, fell behind; while that, even when yoked with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, out-stripped the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee's</a> pair, even although the charioteer it had was a poor one. For what was worse than the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>? But all the same since he made his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> contrite, and called himself a sinner; which indeed he was; he surpassed the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, who had both <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> to tell of and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>; and was removed from any <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. On account of what, and through what? Because even if he was removed from greed of gain and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>, he had rooted over his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>  the mother of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>&mdash; vain-<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. On this account <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also exhorts and says <q>Let each one prove his own work; and then he will have his ground of boasting for himself, and not for the other.</q> Whereas he publicly came forward  as an accuser of the whole world;  and said that he himself was better than all living men. And yet even if he had set himself before ten only, or if five, or if two, or if one, not even was this endurable; but as it was, he not only set himself before the whole world, but also accused all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. On this account he fell behind in the running. And just as a ship, after having run through innumerable surges, and having escaped many storms, then in the very mouth of the harbour having been dashed against some rock, loses the whole treasure which is stowed away in her&mdash; so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> did this <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, after having undergone the labours of the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and of all the rest of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since he did not master his tongue, in the very harbour underwent shipwreck of his cargo.  For the going home from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, whence he ought to have derived gain, having rather been so greatly damaged, is nothing else than undergoing shipwreck in harbour.</p>

<p>2. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> therefore these things, beloved even if we should have mounted to the very pinnacle of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, let us consider ourselves last of all; having learned that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is able to cast down even from the heavens themselves him who takes not heed, and humbleness of mind to bear up on high from the very abyss of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to be sober. For this it was that placed the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> before the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>; whereas that, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> I mean and an overweening spirit, surpassed even an incorporeal power, that of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; while humbleness of mind and the acknowledgment of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed brought the robber into Paradise before the Apostles. Now if the confidence which they who confess their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> effect for themselves is so great, they who are conscious to themselves of many good qualities, yet <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, how great crowns will they not win.  For when sinfulness be put together with humbleness of mind it runs with such ease as to pass and out-strip righteousness combined with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. If therefore thou have put it to with righteousness, whither will it not reach? Through how many heavens will it not pass? By the throne of God itself surely it will stay its course;  in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, with much confidence. On the other hand if <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, having been yoked with righteousness, by the excess and weight of its own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> had strength enough to drag down <em>its</em> confidence; if it be put together with sinfulness, into how deep a <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> will it not be able to precipitate him who has it? These things I say, not in order that we should be careless of righteousness, but that we should avoid <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; not that we should <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that we should be sober-minded. For humbleness of mind is the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of wisdom which pertains to us. Even if you should have built a superstructure of things innumerable; even if almsgiving, even if <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, even if <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, even if all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; unless this have first been laid as a foundation, all will be built upon it  to no purpose and in vain; and it will fall down easily, like that building which had been placed on the sand.  For there is no one, no one of our good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, which does not need this; there is no one which separate from this will be able to stand. But even if you should mention <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, even if <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, even if despising of money, even if anything whatever, all are unclean and accursed and loathsome, humbleness of mind being absent. Everywhere therefore let us take her with us,  in words, in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, in thoughts, and with this let us build these (graces).</p>

<p>3. But the things belonging to humbleness of mind have been sufficiently spoken of; not for the value of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>;  for no one will be able to celebrate it in accordance with its value; but for the intelligence of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For well do I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that even from the few things that have been said you will embrace it with much <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. But since it is also necessary to make clear and manifest the apostolic saying which has been today read; seeming as it does to many to afford a pretext for indolence; so that some may not, providing for themselves hence a certain frigid defence, neglect their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>&mdash; to this let us direct our discourse. What then is this saying? <q>Whether in pretence,</q> it says, <q>or in sincerity,  Christ is preached.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190402"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse18">Philippians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> This many wrest absolutely  and just as happens, without reading what precedes and what comes after it; but having cut it off from the sequence of the remaining members, to the destruction of their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> they put it forward to the more indolent. For attempting to seduce them from the sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; then seeing them afraid and trembling; on the ground of its not being without danger to do this,  and desiring to relieve their fears, they bring forward this apostolic declaration, saying, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> conceded this, by saying, <q>Whether in pretence or in sincerity, let Christ be proclaimed.</q> But these things are not (<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>), they are not. For in the first place he did not say <q>let him be proclaimed,</q> but <q>he is proclaimed,</q> and the difference between this and that is wide. For the saying <q>let him be proclaimed</q> belongs to a lawgiver; but the saying <q>he is proclaimed</q> to one announcing the event. For that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> does not ordain a law that there should be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, but draws away all who attended to him, hear what he says, <q>If any one preaches to you a gospel besides what you have received, let him be anathema,  were it even I, were it even an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from the heavens.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190405"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;1:8-9</a></span> Now he would not have <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> both himself and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, if he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the act to be without danger. And again&mdash; <q>I am jealous of you with a jealousy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he says; <q>for I have <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> you to one husband a chaste virgin: and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest at some time, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his wiliness, so your thoughts should be corrupted from the singleness that is towards Christ.</q>  See, he both set down singleness, and granted no allowance. For if there were allowance, there was no danger: and if there was no danger <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> would not have feared: and Christ would not also have commanded that the tares should be burned up, if it were a thing indifferent to attend to this one or that or another: or to all indiscriminately. </p>

<p>4. What ever then is what is meant? I wish to narrate to you the whole history from a point a little earlier;  for it is needful to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what circumstances <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was when he was writing these things by letter. In what circumstances therefore was he? In <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and chains and intolerable perils. Whence is this manifest? From the epistle itself. For earlier than this he says, <q>Now I wish you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, brethren, that the circumstances in which I am have come rather to the furtherance  of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; so that my bonds have become manifest in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the whole Court, and to all the others; and a good many  of the brethren, trusting to my bonds, the more exceedingly dare fearlessly to speak the word.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190411"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse12">Philippians&nbsp;1:12-14</a></span> Now <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> had then cast him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. For just as some robber having set foot in the house, while all are sleeping, when stealing every thing,  if he see any one having lit a lamp, both extinguishes the light and slays him who holds the lamp, in order that he may be allowed in security to steal and rob the property of others; so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> also the C&aelig;sar <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> then, just as any robber and burglar while all were sleeping a deep and unconscious slumber; robbing the property of all, breaking into marriage chambers,  subverting houses, displaying every form of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; when he saw <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> having lighted a lamp throughout the world; (the word of his teaching;) and reproving his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, exerted himself both to extinguish what was preached, and to put the teachers out of the way; in order that he might be allowed with authority to do anything he pleased; and after binding that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, cast him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. It was at that time then that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> wrote these things. Who would not have been astounded? Who would not have marvelled? Or rather who could adequately have been astounded at and admired that noble and heaven-reaching <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; in that, while bound in Rome and imprisoned, at so great a distance as that, he wrote a letter to the Philippians? For you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how great is the distance between Macedonia and Rome. But neither did the length of the way, nor the amount of time (required), nor the press of business, nor the peril and the dangers coming one upon another, nor anything else, drive out his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for and remembrance of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; but he retained them all in his mind; and not so strongly were his hands bound with the chains as his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was bound together and rivetted by his longing for the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>:  which very thing itself indeed also declaring, in the preface of the Epistle he said, <q>On account of my having you in my heart, both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190415"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;1:7</a></span> And just as a King, having ascended upon his throne at morning-tide and taken his seat in the royal courts, immediately receives from all quarters innumerable letters; so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> he also, just as in royal courts, seated in the dungeon, both received and sent his letters in far greater number; the nations from all quarters referring to his wisdom everything about  what had taken place among themselves; and he administered more business than the reigning monarch in proportion to his having had a larger dominion entrusted to him. For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> God had brought and put into his hands not those who inhabited the country of the Romans only, but also all the barbarians, both land and sea. And by way of showing this he said to the Romans, <q>Now I would not that you should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, brethren, that ofttimes I have purposed to come to you, and have been hindered until the present; in order that I might have some fruit also among you, as among the rest of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> too. Both to Greeks and barbarians, both to wise and those without understanding I am a debtor.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190417"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;1:13-14</a></span> Every day therefore he was in anxious thought at one moment for Corinthians, at another for Macedonians; how Philippians, how Cappadocians, how Galatians, how <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, how they who inhabited Pontus,  how all together were. But all the same, having had the whole world put into his hands, he continually cared not for entire nations only, but also for each single man; and now indeed he dispatched a letter on behalf of Onesimus, and now on behalf of him who among the Corinthians had committed fornication. For neither used he to regard this&mdash; that it was the individual who had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and needed advocacy; but that it was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being; a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, the living thing most precious to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and for whose sake the Father had not spared even the Only-begotten.</p>

<p>5. For do not tell me that this or that man is a runaway slave, or a robber or thief, or laden with countless faults, or that he is a mendicant and abject, or of low value and worthy of no account; but consider that for his sake the Christ died; and this suffices you for a ground for all solicitude. Consider what sort of person <em>he</em> must be, whom Christ valued at so high a price as not to have spared even his own blood. For neither, if a king had chosen to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> himself on any one's behalf, should we have sought out another demonstration of his being some one great and of deep interest to the King&mdash; I fancy not&mdash; for his death would suffice to show the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of him who had died towards him. But as it is not man, not <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, not archangel; but the Lord of the heavens himself, the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> himself having clothed himself with flesh, freely gave himself on our behalf. Shall we not do everything, and take every trouble, so that the men who have been thus valued may enjoy every solicitude at our hands? And what kind of defence shall we have? What allowance? This at least is the very thing by way of declaring which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also said, <q>Do not by your meat destroy him for whose sake Christ died.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190418"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;14:15</a></span> For desiring to shame, and to bring to solicitude, and to persuade to care for their neighbours, those who despise their brethren, and look down upon them as being weak, instead of all  else he set down the Master's death.</p>

<p>Sitting then in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> he wrote the letter to the Philippians from that so great distance. For such as this is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that is according to God:  it is interrupted by no one of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things, since it has its roots from above in the heavens  and its recompense. And what says he? <q>Now I desire that you should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, brethren.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190422"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse12">Philippians&nbsp;1:12</a></span> Do you see solicitude for his scholars? Do you see a teacher's carefulness? Hear too of loving affection of scholars towards their teacher, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this was what made them strong and unconquerable&mdash; the being bound together with one another. For if <q>Brother helped by brother is as a strong city;</q>  far more so many bound together by the bonds of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> would have entirely repulsed the plotting of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>. That indeed then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was bound up with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, requires not even any demonstration further nor argument for us, since in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> even when in bonds he anxiously cared for them, and each day, he was also dying for them, burning with his longing.</p>

<p>6. And that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> too were bound up with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> with all perfectness;  and that not men only, but <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also, hear what he says about Ph&oelig;be. <q>Now I commend  to you Ph&oelig;be the sister, being a <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is in Cenchre&aelig;; that you may receive her in the Lord worthily of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and stand by her, in whatever matter she may require you, since  she has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a helper  of many; and of me myself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190428"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;16:1-2</a></span> But in this instance he bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to her of her <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> so far as help went (only:)  but Priscilla and Aquilla went as far even as death for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> sake; and about them he thus writes, saying, <q><a href="../cathen/01661b.htm">Aquila and Priscilla</a> salute you, who for my life's sake laid down their own neck;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190430"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;16:3-4</a></span> for death clearly. And about another again writing to these very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> he says, <q>Because he went as far as death; having counselled ill for his life, in order that he might supply your deficiency in your service towards me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190431"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse30">Philippians&nbsp;2:30</a></span> Do you see how they loved their teacher? How they regarded his rest  before their own life? On this account no one surpassed them then. Now this I say, not that we may hear only, but that we may also imitate; and not to the ruled only, but also to those who rule is what we say addressed; in order that both scholars may display much solicitude about their teachers, and the teachers may have the same loving affection as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> about those placed under them; not those present only, but also those who are far off. For also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, dwelling in the whole world just as in one house, thus continually took thought for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all; and having dismissed every thing of his own; bonds and troubles and stripes and straits, watched over and inquired into each day, in what state the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were; and often for this very purpose alone sent, now Timothy, and now Tychicus; and about him he says, <q>That he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your circumstances, and encourage your hearts:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190433"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse22">Ephesians&nbsp;6:22</a></span> and about Timothy; <q>I have sent him, being no longer able to contain myself; lest in some way the tempter have tempted you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190434"><a href="../bible/1th003.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> And Titus again elsewhere, and another to another place. For since he himself, by the compulsion of his bonds being often detained in one place, was unable to meet those who were his vitals, he met them through the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</p>

<p>7. And then therefore being in bonds he writes to the Philippians, saying, <q>Now I desire that you should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, brethren,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190435"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse12">Philippians&nbsp;1:12</a></span> calling the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> brethren. For such a thing as this is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; it casts out all inequality, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not superiority and dignity; but even if one be higher than all, he descends to the lowlier position of all; just what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also used to do. But let us hear what it is that he desires they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. <q>That the things which happened unto me,</q> he says, <q>have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190436"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse12">Philippians&nbsp;1:12</a></span> Tell me, how and in what way? Have you then been released from your bonds? Have you then put off your chain? And do you with free permission preach in the city? Have you then, having gone into an assembly, drawn out many long discourses about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and departed after gaining many <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>? Have you then raised the dead and been made an object of wonder? Have you then cleansed <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, and all were astounded? Have you driven away <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and been exalted? No one of these things, he says. How then did the furtherance of the gospel take place? Tell me. <q>So that my bonds,</q> he says, <q>have become openly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the whole Court, and to all the rest.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190437"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> What do you say? This then, this was the furtherance, this the advance, this the increase of the proclamation&mdash; that all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that you were bound. Yes, he says: Hear at least what comes next, that you may learn that the bonds not only <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> no hindrance, but also a ground of greater freedom of speech. <q>So that several  of the brethren in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, in reliance on my bonds, more abundantly dare fearlessly to speak the word.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190439"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse14">Philippians&nbsp;1:14</a></span> What do you say, O <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? Have your bonds inspired not anxiety but confidence? Not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> but earnest longing? The things mentioned have no consistency.  I too <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. For neither did these things take place according to the consistency of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, he means,  but what came about was above nature, and the successes were of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>. On this account what used to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> anxiety to all others, that to him afforded confidence. For also if any one having taken the leader of an army and confined him, have made this publicly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, he throws the whole camp into flight; and if any one have carried a shepherd away from the flock, the security with which he drives off the sheep is great. But not in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> case was it thus, but the contrary entirely. For the leader of the army was bound, and the soldiers became more forward in the spirit; and the confidence with which they sprung upon their adversaries was greater: the shepherd was in confinement, and the sheep were not consumed, nor even scattered.</p>

<p>8. Who ever saw, who ever heard of, the scholars taking greater encouragement in the dangers of their teachers? How was it that they feared not? How was it that they were not terrified? How was it that they did not say to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>Physician, heal yourself,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190442"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;4:23</a></span> deliver yourself from your manifold perils, and then thou will be able to procure for us those countless <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things? How was it they did not say these things? How! It was because they had been schooled, from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that these things took place not out of weakness, but out of the permission of the Christ; in order that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might shine abroad more largely; through bonds and imprisonments and tribulations and straits increasing and rising, to a greater volume. Thus is the power of Christ in weakness perfected.  For indeed if his bonds had crippled <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>  and made him cowardly; either himself or those belonging to him; one could not but feel difficulty; but if rather they prepared him into greater renown, one must be astounded and marvel, how through a thing involving dishonour <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was procured for the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>&mdash; through a thing inspiring cowardice confidence and encouragement resulted to them all. For who was not astounded at him then, seeing him encircled with a chain? Then <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> took to flight all the more, when they saw him spending his time in a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. For not so splendid does the diadem make a royal head, as the chain his hands; not owing to their proper nature, but owing to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that darted brightness on them.  On this account it was that great encouragement resulted to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. For also they saw his body indeed bound, but his tongue not bound, his hands indeed tightly manacled,  but his voice unshackled, and transversing the whole world more swiftly than the solar ray. And this became to them an encouragement; learning as they did from the facts that no one of present things is to be dreaded. For when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been genuinely imbued by divine longing and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, it pays regard to no one of things present; but just as those who are mad venture themselves against fire and sword and wild beasts and sea and all else, so these too, maddened with a most noble and most spiritual frenzy, a frenzy arising from sanity,  used to laugh at all things that are seen. On this account, seeing their teachers bound, they the more exulted, the more prided themselves; by facts giving to their adversaries a demonstration that on all sides they were impregnable and indomitable.</p>

<p>9. Then therefore, when matters were in this state, some of the enemies of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, desiring to fan up the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to greater vehemence, and to make the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the tyrant, which was felt towards him greater, pretended that they themselves also preached; (and they did preach the right and sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,) for the sake of the doctrine advancing more rapidly: and this they did, not with the desire to disseminate the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but in order that <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, having learned that the preaching was increasing and the doctrine advancing, might the sooner have <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> led away to execution.  There were therefore two schools; that of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> scholars and that of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> enemies; the one preaching out of sincerity, and the others out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of contention and the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> they felt towards <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. And by way of declaring this he said, <q>Some indeed through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and strife are preaching Christ,</q> (pointing out those his enemies) <q>but some also through good pleasure;</q>  saying this about his own scholars. <span class="stiki" id="note190450"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;1:15</a></span> Then next about those; <q>Some indeed out of contentiousness,</q> (his enemies,) not purely, not soundly, but, <q>thinking that they are thereby bringing pressure upon my bonds; <span class="stiki" id="note190451"><!--k28--<a href="../bible/phi005.htm#verse17">Philippians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> but the others out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>;</q> (this again about his own brethren;) <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that I am set  for the defence of the gospel.</q> For what? Nevertheless, in any way; whether in pretence or in sincerity, Christ is being announced. <span class="stiki" id="note190453"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse16">Philippians&nbsp;1:16-18</a></span> So that vainly and to no purpose is this saying taken in reference to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. For those who then were preaching were not preaching corrupt doctrine; but sound and right belief. For if they were preaching corrupt doctrine, and were teaching other things contrary to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, what they desired was certain not to succeed to them. Now what did they desire? That the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> having grown, and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> having become numerous, it should rouse <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> to greater hostility. And if they were preaching different doctrines, they would not have made the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> numerous; and by not doing so,  they would not have exasperated the tyrant. He does not therefore say this&mdash; that they were bringing in corrupt doctrines&mdash; but that the motive from which they were preaching, <em>this</em> was corrupt. For it is one thing to state the pretext  of their preaching itself was not sound. For the preaching does not become sound when the doctrine is laden with deception; and the pretext does not become sound when the preaching indeed is sound, but they who preach do not preach for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but either with a view of enmity, or with a view to the favour of others.</p>

<p>10. He therefore does not say this&mdash; that they were bringing in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>; but that it was not from a right motive, nor through <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>  that they were preaching what they did preach. For it was not they might increase the gospel that they were doing this; but that they might wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against him, and throw him into greater danger&mdash; on this account he accuses them. And see how with exactitude he laid it.  <q>Thinking,</q> he says, <q>that they were putting pressure upon my bonds.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190458"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse17">Philippians&nbsp;1:17</a></span> He did not say, putting, but <q>thinking they were putting upon,</q> that is supposing, by way of pointing out that even if they so supposed, still he himself was not in such a position; but that he even rejoiced on account of the advance of the preaching. He added therefore saying, <q>But in this I both <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190459"><!--k28--<a href="../bible/phi005.htm#verse18">Philippians&nbsp;5:18</a></span> whereas if he held their doctrines deception, and they were bringing in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> could not possibly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. But since the doctrine was sound and of genuine parentage, on this account he says, <q>I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.</q> For what if they  are destroying themselves by doing this out of contentiousness? Still, even unwillingly, they are strengthening my <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Do you see how great is <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> power? How he is caught by no one of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> machinations? And not only is he not caught; but also by these themselves he subdues him. For great indeed is both the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> craftiness,  and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of those who minister to him; for under pretence of being of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, they desired to extinguish the proclamation.  But <q>he who seizes the cunning in their craftiness</q>  did not permit that this should take place then. By way of declaring this very thing at least <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, <q>But the continuing in the flesh is the more necessary for your sake; and this I confidently <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that I shall continue and remain in company with you all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190464"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse24">Philippians&nbsp;1:24-25</a></span> For those men indeed set their mind on casting me out of the present life, and are ready to endure anything for this object: but God does not permit it on your account.</p>

<p>11. These things therefore, all of them, remember with exactness in order that you may be able with all wisdom to correct those who use the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> without reference to circumstances  and at hap-hazard, and for the destruction of their neighbours. And we shall be able both to remember what has been said, and to correct others, if we always betake ourselves to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> as a refuge, and beseech the God who gives the word of wisdom to grant both intelligence in hearing, and a careful and unconquerable guardianship of this spiritual deposit in our hands. For things which often we have not strength to perform successfully from our own exertions, these we shall have power to accomplish easily through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which are persevering. For always and without intermission it is a duty to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, both for him who is in affliction, and him who is in dangers, and him who is in prosperity&mdash; for him who is in relief and much prosperity, that these may remain unmoved and without vicissitude, and may never change; and for him who is in affliction and his many dangers, that he may see some favourable change brought about to him, and be transported into a calm of consolation. Are you in a calm? Then beseech God that this calm may continue settled to you. Have you seen a storm risen up against you? Beseech God earnestly  to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the billow to pass, and to make a calm out of the storm. Have you been heard? Be heartily thankful for this; because you have been heard. Have you not been heard? Persevere,  in order that you may be heard. For even if God at any time delay the giving, it is not in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and aversion;  but from the desire by the deferring of the giving perpetually to retain you with himself; just in the way also that affectionate fathers do;  for they also adroitly manage the perpetual and assiduous attendance of children who are rather indolent by the delay of the giving. There is to you no need of mediators in audience with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor of that much canvassing;  nor of the fawning upon others; but even if you be destitute, even if bereft of advocacy, alone, by yourself, having called on God for help, you will in any case succeed.  He is not so wont to assent when entreated by others on our behalf, as by ourselves who are in need; even if we be laden with ten thousand <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>. For if in the case of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, even if we have come into countless collisions with them, when both at dawn and at mid-day and in the evening we show ourselves to those who are aggrieved against us, by the unbroken continuance and the persistent meeting and interview we easily demolish their enmity&mdash; far more in the case of God would this be effected.</p>

<p>12. But you are unworthy. Become worthy by your assiduity. For that it both is possible that the unworthy should become worthy from his assiduity; and that God assents more when called on by ourselves than by others; and that he often delays the giving, not from the wish that we should be utterly perplexed, nor to send us out  with empty hands; but in order that he may become the author of greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to us&mdash; these three points I will endeavour to make evident by the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> which has today been read to you. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> had come to Christ <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> on behalf of a daughter possessed by a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, and crying out with much earnestness  (it says,  <q>Have pity on me, Lord, my daughter is badly possessed by a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>.</q>) See, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of a strange nation, and a barbarian, and outside of the Jewish commonwealth. For indeed what else (was she) than a dog,  and unworthy of the receiving her request? For <q>it is not,</q> he says, <q>good to take the children's bread, and to give it to the dogs.</q> But, all the same, from her assiduity, she became worthy. For not only did he admit her into the nobility of children, dog as she was; but also he sent her off with that high encomium saying, <q>O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> great is your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; be it done to you as you will.</q>  Now when the Christ says, <q>great is your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> seek thou no other demonstration of the greatness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which was in the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Do you see how, from her assiduity the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, being unworthy, became worthy? Desirest thou also to learn that we accomplish (our wish) by calling on him by ourselves more than by others? She cried out, and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> having come to him say, <q>Let her go away, for she is crying after us:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190477"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;5:23</a></span> and to them he says, <q>I am not sent, unless to the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190478"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;5:24</a></span> But when she had come to him by herself and continued crying, and saying, <q>Yes, Lord, for even the dogs eat from the table of their masters,</q>  then he granted the favour and says, <q>Be it done unto you as you will.</q> Do you see how, when they were entreating him, he repelled; but when she who needed the gift herself cried out, he assented? For to them he says, <q>I am not sent, unless to the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>;</q> but to her  he said, <q>Great is your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; be it done unto you as you will.</q> Again, at the beginning and in the prelude of her request he answered nothing; but when both once and twice and thrice she had come to him, then he granted the boon; by the issue making us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he had delayed the giving, not that he might repel her  but that he might display to us all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> endurance. For if he had delayed in order that he might repel her, he would have not granted it even at the end; but since he was waiting to display to all her spiritual wisdom, on this account he was silent.  For if he had granted it immediately and at the beginning, we should not have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.  <q>Let her go</q>  it says, <q>because she is clamouring behind us.</q> But what (says) the Christ? You hear a voice, but I see the mind: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what she is going to say. I choose not to permit the treasure hidden in her mind to escape notice; but I am waiting and keeping silence; in order that having discovered it I may lay it down in publicity, and make it manifest to all.</p>

<p>13. Having therefore learned all these things, even if we be in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and unworthy of receiving, let us not despair; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, that by assiduity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> we shall be able to become worthy of the request. Even if we be unaided by advocate and destitute, let us not faint; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is a strong advocacy&mdash; the coming to God one's self by one's self with much eagerness. Even if he delay and defer with respect to the giving, let us not be dispirited; having learned that the putting it off and delay is a sure <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of caring and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. If we have thus persuaded ourselves; and with a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> deeply pained and fervent, and thoroughly roused purpose; and such as that with which the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> approached, we too come to him, even if we be dogs; even if we have done anything whatever dreadful; we shall both rebut  our own crimes, and obtain so great liberty of speech  as also to be advocates for others; in the way in which also this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> not only herself enjoyed liberty of speech and ten thousand encomiums but had power to snatch her dear daughter  out of her intolerable sufferings. For nothing&mdash; nothing is more powerful than <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> when fervent and genuine. This both disperses present dangers, and rescues from the penalties which take place at that hour.  That therefore we may both complete our passage through the present life with ease,  and depart there  with confidence, with much <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and eagerness let us perform this perpetually. For thus shall we be able both to attain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which are laid up, and to enjoy those excellent hopes; which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant that we may all attain; by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and loving kindness and compassion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>&mdash; with whom to the Father together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, dominion, to the ages of the ages.  <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
