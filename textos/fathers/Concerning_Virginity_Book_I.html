<h1>Concerning Virginity (Book I)</h1>

<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<p>The state of Virginity is undoubtedly commended in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, both by our Lord and St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, but learned men have differed in their opinions as to the original customs and rules observed by <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in the earliest ages. Some suppose that from the very beginning it was the custom for them to make a solemn profession of the virgin life, and to live together in common. Others consider that their vows were private, and they lived sometimes together, sometimes in the homes of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Others, again, believing that there was no more than a simple purpose on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> signified by the veil, and the simplicity of their dress, attribute the first commencements of community life to St. Ambrose himself.</p>

<p>The first opinion is hardly tenable as regards any profession which was notorious. Statements in the earlier Acts of Martyrs are to be regarded with suspicion, as so much of this class of writings is spurious. The utterances also of Fathers and Councils hardly establish anything on this point more than on the second mentioned above.</p>

<p>There would seem to have been some who publicly, like Marcellina, the sister of St. Ambrose, made their profession, and formally received the veil at the hands of the Bishop; and others, equally steadfast in purpose, whose vow of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> was made in private. Of the former, those living in Milan hardly seem to have led a life in common, but at Bologna [I. 60] they did. The terms, vow, taking the veil, and profession, were in use in St. Ambrose's day, as at present.</p>

<p>It would appear, then, that from the days of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> there were some who devoted themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a life of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and that later on the promise or vow was made in the presence of others&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and friends. These <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> lived at home with their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, while the times of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> endured, making it practically impossible for them to live elsewhere. Common life among them would seem to have commenced in the East, and St. Athanasius, when, seeking refuge from the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, he came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, introduced the custom to the Western Church.</p>

<p>St. Ambrose worked vigorously in this direction, not only in his own diocese, but in neighbouring provinces, and even in Africa. Early in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> he addressed his flock on the subject, and at the request of his sister, Marcellina, gathered up his teaching in the following three books.</p>

<p>In the first book he treats of the dignity of Virginity, and states his reason for writing. As he commences his addresses on the anniversary of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/01214a.htm">St. Agnes</a>, he takes her story as the subject of the earlier part of the treatise, and shows how, among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and even among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> was shadowed forth, and eventually proclaimed by the corning of our Lord. He then warns <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, not to prevent their daughters from hearing addresses on this subject, and touches on the number of those who came even from great distances to receive the veil at Milan.</p>

<p>In the second book, speaking of the character and manner of life of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, he does this, as he says, by adducing examples and instances, preferably to laying down a code of rules. He speaks of Thecla, patron saint of Milan, a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and of other <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>.</p>

<p>In the third book he goes through a summary of the address given by Pope Liberius, when Marcellina received the veil at his hands, before a large congregation. Some cautions are introduced by St. Ambrose against excessive austerity, and instead of some outward acts, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the practice of interior <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are recommended. The subject of certain <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who had committed suicide rather than lose their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is dwelt upon in answer to a question of Marcellina.</p>

<p>The writer himself states that this treatise was composed in the third year of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, a.d. 377, and it is quoted with approval by St. Jerome, <em>Ep</em>. XXII. 22 and XLVIII. 14 [Vol. VI., pp. 31 and 75, of this series, and St. Augustine, <em>de doct. Christ.</em> IV. 48, 50.</p>

<p><strong>To Marcellina, His Sister.</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p><strong>St. Ambrose, reflecting upon the account he will have to give of his talents, determines to write, and consoles himself with certain examples of God's mercy. Then recognizing his own deficiencies desires that he may be dealt with like the fig-tree in the Gospel, and expresses a hope that words will not fail him in his endeavour to preach Christ.</strong></p>

<p>1. If, according to the decree of heavenly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we have to give account of every idle word which we have spoken, <span class="stiki" id="note343161"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;12:36</a></span> and if every servant will incur no small blame when his lord returns, who, either like a timid money-lender or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> owner, has hidden in the earth the talents of spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which were entrusted to him in order that they might be multiplied by increasing interest, I, who, although possessed of but moderate ability, yet have a great necessity laid on me of making increase of the sayings of God entrusted to me, must rightly <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest an account of the profit of my words be demanded of me, especially seeing that the Lord exacts of us effort, not profit. Wherefore I determined to write something, since, too, my words are listened to with greater risk to modesty than when they are written, for a book has no feeling of modesty.</p>

<p>2. And so distrusting indeed my own ability, but encouraged by the instances of divine mercy, I venture to compose an address, for when God willed even the ass spoke. <span class="stiki" id="note343162"><a href="../bible/num022.htm#verse28">Numbers&nbsp;22:28</a></span> And I will open my mouth long dumb, that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> may assist me also, engaged in the burdens of this world, for He can do away with the hindrances of unskilfulness, Who in the ass did away those of nature. In the ark of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> rod budded; <span class="stiki" id="note343163"><a href="../bible/num017.htm#verse8">Numbers&nbsp;17:8</a></span> with God it is easy that in Holy Church a flower should spring from our knots also. And why should we despair that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should speak in men, Who spoke in the thorn bush? <span class="stiki" id="note343164"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse4">Exodus&nbsp;3:4</a></span> God did not despise the bush, and would He might give light also to my thorns. Perhaps some may wonder that there is some light even in our thorns; some our thorns will not burn; there will be some whose shoes shall be put off their feet at the sound of my voice, that the steps of the mind may be freed from bodily hindrances.</p>

<p>3. But these things are gained by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men. Would that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> would cast a glance upon me still lying under that barren fig-tree, <span class="stiki" id="note343165"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse48">John&nbsp;1:48</a></span> and that my fig-tree might also after three years bear fruit.  But whence should sinners have so great hope? Would that at least that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> dresser of the vineyard, perhaps already bidden to cut down my fig-tree, would let it alone this year also, until he dig about it and dung it, that he may perchance lift the helpless out of the dust, and lift the poor out of the mire.  Blessed are they who bind their horses under the vine and olive, <span class="stiki" id="note343168"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse11">Genesis&nbsp;49:11</a></span> consecrating the course of their labours to light and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: the fig-tree, that is, the tempting attraction of the pleasures of the world, still overshadows me, low in height, brittle for working, soft for use, and barren of fruit.</p>

<p>4. And perhaps some one may wonder why I, who cannot speak, venture to write. And yet if we consider what we read in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Zacharias is taken as an instance, he will find that there is something which the voice cannot explain, but the pen can write. And if the name John restored speech to his father, <span class="stiki" id="note343169"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse63">Luke&nbsp;1:63-64</a></span> I, too, ought not to despair that although dumb I may yet receive speech, if I speak of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of Whom, according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> word: <q>Who shall declare the generation?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343170"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;53:8</a></span> And so as a servant I will announce the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Lord, for the Lord has <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Himself a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> even in this body of humanity replete with frailty.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p><strong>This treatise has a favourable beginning, since it is the birthday of the holy Virgin Agnes, of whose name, modesty, and martyrdom St. Ambrose speaks in commendation, but more especially of her age, seeing that she, being but twelve years old, was superior to terrors, promises, tortures, and death itself, with a courage wholly worthy of a man.</strong></p>

<p>5. And my task begins favourably, that since today is the birthday of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, I have to speak of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and the treatise has its beginning from this discourse. It is the birthday of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, let us offer the victim. It is the birthday of <a href="../cathen/01214a.htm">St. Agnes</a>, let men admire, let children take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, let the married be astounded, let the unmarried take an example. But what can I say worthy of her whose very name was not devoid of bright praise? In devotion beyond her age, in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> above nature, she seems to me to have borne not so much a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> name, as a token of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, whereby she showed what she was to be.</p>

<p>6. But I have that which may assist me. The name of virgin is a title of modesty. I will call upon the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, I will proclaim the virgin. That panegyric is long enough which needs no elaboration, but is within our grasp. Let then labour cease, eloquence be silent. One word is praise enough. This word old men and young and boys chant. No one is more praiseworthy than he who can be praised by all. There are as many heralds as there are men, who when they speak proclaim the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.</p>

<p>7. She is said to have suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> when twelve years old. The more hateful was the cruelty, which spared not so tender an age, the greater in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was the power of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which found evidence even in that age. Was there room for a wound in that small body? And she who had no room for the blow of the steel had that wherewith to conquer the steel. But maidens of that age are unable to bear even the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> looks of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and are wont to cry at the pricks of a needle as though they were wounds. She was fearless under the cruel hands of the executioners, she was unmoved by the heavy weight of the creaking chains, offering her whole body to the sword of the raging soldier, as yet <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of death, but ready for it. Or if she were unwillingly hurried to the altars, she was ready to stretch forth her hands to Christ at the sacrificial fires, and at the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> altars themselves, to make the sign of the Lord the Conqueror,  or again to place her neck and both her hands in the iron bands, but no band could enclose such slender limbs.</p>

<p>8. A new kind of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>! Not yet of fit age for punishment but already ripe for victory, difficult to contend with but easy to be crowned, she filled the office of teaching valour while having the disadvantage of youth. She would not as a bride so hasten to the couch, as being a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> she joyfully went to the place of punishment with hurrying step, her head not adorned with plaited hair, but with Christ. All wept, she alone was without a tear. All wondered that she was so readily prodigal of her life, which she had not yet enjoyed, and now gave up as though she had gone through it. Every one was astounded that there was now one to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the Godhead, who as yet could not, because of her age, dispose of herself. And she brought it to pass that she should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose evidence concerning man would not be accepted. For that which is beyond nature is from the Author of nature.</p>

<p>9. What threats the executioner used to make her <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> him, what allurements to persuade her, how many desired that she would come to them in marriage! But she answered: <q>It would be an injury to my spouse to look on any one as likely to please me. He who chose me first for Himself shall receive me. Why are you delaying, executioner? Let this body perish which can be loved by eyes which I would not.</q> She stood, she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, she bent down her neck. You could see the executioner tremble, as though he himself had been condemned, and his right hand shake, his face grow pale, as he feared the peril of another, while the maiden feared not for her own. You have then in one victim a twofold <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, of modesty and of religion. She both remained a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and she obtained <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p><strong>Virginity is praised on many grounds, but chiefly because it brought down the Word from heaven, and hence its pursuit, which existed in but few under the old covenant, has spread to countless numbers.</strong></p>

<p>10. And now the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of purity draws me on, and you, my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sister, even though not speaking in your silent habit, to say something about <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, lest that which is a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should seem to be passed by with only a slight reference. For <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not praiseworthy because it is found in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, but because itself makes <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.</p>

<p>11. But who can comprehend that by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> understanding which not even nature has included in her <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>? Or who can explain in ordinary language that which is above the course of nature? Virginity has brought from heaven that which it may imitate on earth. And not unfittingly has she sought her manner of life from heaven, who has found for herself a Spouse in heaven. She, passing beyond the clouds, air, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and stars, has found the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> in the very bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and has drawn Him into herself with her whole heart. For who having found so great a Good would forsake it? For <q>Your Name is as ointment poured out, therefore have the maidens loved You, and drawn You.</q>  And indeed what I have said is not my own, since they who marry not nor are given in marriage are as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in heaven. Let us not, then, be surprised if they are compared to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are joined to the Lord of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Who, then, can deny that this mode of life has its source in heaven, which we don't easily find on earth, except since God came down into the members of an earthly body? Then a Virgin conceived, and the Word became flesh that flesh might become God.</p>

<p>12. But some one will say: <q>But Elijah is seen to have had nothing to do with the embraces of bodily <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> And therefore was he carried by a chariot into heaven,  therefore he appeared <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> with the Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note343174"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;17:3</a></span> and therefore he is to come as the forerunner of the Lord's advent. <span class="stiki" id="note343175"><a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse5">Malachi&nbsp;4:5</a></span> And Miriam taking the timbrel led the dances with maidenly modesty. <span class="stiki" id="note343176"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;15:20</a></span> But consider whom she was then representing. Was she not a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who as a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> with unstained spirit joins together the religious gatherings of the people to sing divine songs? For we read that there were <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> appointed also in the temple at Jerusalem. But what says the Apostle? <q>These things happened to them in a figure, that they might be signs of what was to come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343177"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:11</a></span> For the figure is shown in few, the life exists in many.</p>

<p>13. But in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> after that the Lord, coming in our flesh, joined together the Godhead and flesh without any confusion or mixture, then the practice of the life of heaven spreading throughout the whole world was implanted in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies. This is that which <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> ministering on earth signified should come to pass, <span class="stiki" id="note343178"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;4:11</a></span> which ministry should be offered to the Lord with the service of an unstained body. This is that heavenly service which the host of rejoicing <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> spoke of for the earth. <span class="stiki" id="note343179"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;2:13-14</a></span> We have, then, the authority of antiquity from of old, the fullness of the setting forth from Christ Himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p><strong>The comeliness of virginity never existed amongst the heathen, neither with the vestal virgins, nor amongst philosophers, such as Pythagoras.</strong></p>

<p>14. I <span class="sc">certainly</span> have not this in common with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, nor in regard to it am I associated with barbarians, nor practise it with other animals, with whom, although we breathe one and the same vital air, and have a common condition of an earthly body, and from whom we differ not in the mode of generation, in this point alone we nevertheless avoid the reproach of likeness, that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is aimed at by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, but when <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> it is violated, it is attacked by barbarians, and is unknown to others.</p>

<p>15. Who will allege to me the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of Vesta, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Pallas? What sort of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is that which is not of morals, but of years, which is appointed not for ever, but for a term! Such purity is all the more wanton of which the corruption is put off for a later age. They teach their <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> ought not to persevere, and are unable to do so, who have set a term to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. What sort of a religion is that in which modest maidens are bidden to be immodest old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>? Nor is she modest who is bound by law, and she immodest who is set free by law. O the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>! O the morals! Where <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is enforced by law and authority given for <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>! And so she is not chaste, who is constrained by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; nor <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, who is hired for a price; nor is that modesty which, exposed to the daily importunity of lascivious eyes, is attacked by disgraceful looks. Exemptions are bestowed upon them, prices are offered them, as though to sell one's <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> were not the greatest sign of wantonness. That which is promised for a price is given up for a price; is made over for a price; is considered to have its price. She who is wont to sell her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not how to redeem it.</p>

<p>16. What shall I say of the Phrygian <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, in which immodesty is the rule, and that too of the weaker sex? What of the orgies of Bacchus, where the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> is an incentive to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>? Of what sort can the lives of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> be, then, where the adulteries of the gods are matters of religion. So then they have no sacred <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>.</p>

<p>17. Let us see whether perchance the precepts of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have formed any, for they are wont to claim the teaching of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. A certain <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> virgin is spoken of in story, whom a tyrant was endeavouring to compel to reveal the secret, and lest it should be possible even in her torments for revelation to be extorted from her, she bit off her tongue and spat it in the tyrant's face, that he who would not make an end of questioning might not have anything to question.</p>

<p>18. But that same virgin, so constant in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, was overcome by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, though she could not be overcome by torments. And so she who could keep the secret of her mind could not conceal the shame of her body. She overcame nature, but observed not discipline. How she would desire that her speech had <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> as a defence of her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>! So she was not unconquered on every side, for although the tyrant could not find out that which he sought, yet he did find what he sought not.</p>

<p>19. How much stronger are our <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, who overcome even those powers which they do not see; whose victory is not only over flesh and blood, but also over the prince of this world, and ruler of this age! In age, <a href="../cathen/01214a.htm">Agnes</a> indeed was less, but in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> greater, triumphing over more, more constant in her confidence; she did not destroy her tongue through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but kept it for a trophy. For there was nothing in her which she feared to betray, since that which she acknowledged was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, not sinful. And so the former merely concealed her secret, the latter bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the Lord, and confessed Him in her body, Whom her age did not yet suffer to confess.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p><strong>Heaven is the home of virginity, and the Son of God its Author, Who though He was a Virgin before the Virgin, yet being of the Virgin took the Virgin Church as His bride. Of her we have all been born. Some of her gifts are enumerated. Her daughters have a special excellence in that virginity is not a matter of precept, and that it is a most powerful help in the pursuit of piety.</strong></p>

<p>20. It is the custom in encomiums to speak of country and parentage of the subject, that the greatness of the offspring may be enhanced by mention of the father. Now I, who have not undertaken to praise but to set forth <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, yet think it to the purpose to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> its country and its parent. First, let us settle where is its country. Now, if one's country be there where is the home of one's birth, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> heaven is the native country of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. And so she is a stranger here, but a denizen there.</p>

<p>21. And what is virginal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> but purity free from stain? And whom can we judge to be its author but the immaculate <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Whose flesh saw no corruption, Whose Godhead experienced no infection? Consider, then, how great are the merits of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Christ was before the Virgin, Christ was of the Virgin. Begotten indeed of the Father before the ages, but born of the Virgin for the ages. The former was of His own nature, the latter is for our benefit. The former always was, the latter He willed.</p>

<p>22. Consider, too, another merit of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Christ is the spouse of the Virgin, and if one may so say of virginal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not Christ of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. He is, then, the Virgin Who was espoused, the Virgin Who bare us, Who fed us with her own milk, of whom we read: <q>How great things has the virgin of Jerusalem done! The teats shall not fail from the rock, nor snow from Lebanon, nor the water which is borne by the strong wind.</q>  Who is this virgin that is watered with the streams of the Trinity, from whose rock waters flow, whose teats fail not, and whose honey is poured forth? Now, according to the Apostle, the rock is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note343181"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4</a></span> Therefore, from Christ the teats fail not, nor brightness from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor the river from the Spirit. This is the Trinity which waters their Church, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Christ, and the Spirit.</p>

<p>23. But let us now come down from the mother to the daughters. <q>Concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>,</q> says the Apostle, <q>I have no commandment of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343182"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> If the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> had none, who could have one? And in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he had no commandment, but he had an example. For <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> cannot be commanded, but must be wished for, for things which are above us are matters for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> rather than under mastery. <q>But I would have you,</q> he says, <q>be without carefulness. For he who is without a wife is careful for the things which are the Lord's, how he may please God....And the virgin takes thought for the things of the Lord, that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in body and in spirit. For she that is married takes thought for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p><strong>St. Ambrose explains that he is not speaking against marriage, and proceeds to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the single and married state.</strong></p>

<p>24. I am not indeed discouraging marriage, but am enlarging upon the benefits of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. <q>He who is weak,</q> says the Apostle, <q>eats herbs.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343184"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;14:2</a></span> I consider one thing necessary, I admire another. <q>Are you bound to a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Are you free from a wife? Seek not a wife.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343185"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:27</a></span> This is the command to those who are. But what does he say concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>? <q>He who gives his virgin in marriage does well, and he who gives her not does better.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343186"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse38">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:38</a></span> The one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not if she marries, the other, if she marries not, it is for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. In the former is the remedy for weakness, in the latter the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. The former is not reproved, the latter is praised.</p>

<p>25. Let us compare, if it pleases you, the advantages of married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with that which awaits <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Though the noble <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> boasts of her abundant offspring, yet the more she bears the more she endures. Let her count up the comforts of her children, but let her likewise count up the troubles. She marries and weeps. How many vows does she make with tears. She conceives, and her fruitfulness brings her trouble before offspring. She brings forth and is ill. How sweet a pledge which begins with danger and ends in danger, which will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pain before pleasure! It is purchased by perils, and is not possessed at her own will.</p>

<p>26. Why speak of the troubles of nursing, training, and marrying? These are the miseries of those who are fortunate. A mother has heirs, but it increases her sorrows. For we must not speak of adversity, lest the minds of the holiest <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> tremble. Consider, my sister, how hard it must be to bear what one must not speak of. And this is in this present age. But the days shall come when they shall say: <q>Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343187"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;23:29</a></span> For the daughters of this age are conceived, and conceive; but the daughter of the kingdom refrains from wedded pleasure, and the pleasure of the flesh, that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in body and in spirit.</p>

<p>27. Why should I further speak of the painful ministrations and services due to their husbands from wives, to whom before slaves God gave the command to serve? <span class="stiki" id="note343188"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;3:16</a></span> And I mention these things that they may comply more willingly, whose reward, if approved, is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; if not approved, punishment for the fault.</p>

<p>28. And in this position spring up those incentives to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, in that they paint their faces with various colours, fearing not to please their husbands; and from staining their faces, come to think of staining their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. What <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is here, to change the fashion of nature and seek a painting, and while fearing a husband's judgment to give up their own. For she is the first to speak against herself who wishes to change that which is natural to her. So, while studying to please others, she displeases herself. What <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to your unsightliness do we require, O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, than yourself who art afraid to be seen? If you are beautiful, why hidest you yourself? If unsightly, why do you <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> pretend to beauty, so as to have neither the satisfaction of your own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, nor of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of another? For he loves another, you desire to please another. And are you <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> if he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> another, who is taught to do so in your own person? You are an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> teacher of your own injury.</p>

<p>29. And next, what expense is necessary that even a beautiful wife may not fail to please? Costly necklaces on the one hand hang on her neck, on the other a robe woven with gold is dragged along the ground. Is this display purchased, or is it a real possession? And what varied enticements of perfumes are made use of! The ears are weighed down with gems, a different colour from nature is dropped into the eyes. What is there left which is her own, when so much is changed? The married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> loves her own perceptions, and does she think that this is to live?</p>

<p>30. But you, O <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not such torments, rather than ornaments, whose <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> modesty, beaming in your bashful cheeks, and sweet <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> are a beauty, you do not, intent upon the eyes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, consider as merits what is gained by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of others. You, too, have indeed your own beauty, furnished by the comeliness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not of the body, to which age puts not an end, which death cannot take away, nor any sickness injure. Let God alone be sought as the judge of loveliness, Who loves even in less beautiful bodies the more beautiful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of the burden and pain of childbearing, but more are the offspring of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which esteems all as its children, which is rich in successors, barren of all bereavements, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no deaths, but has many heirs.</p>

<p>31. So the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of wedlock, but fertile in bearing, is in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, yet a mother in offspring. She, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, bears us her children, not by a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father, but by the Spirit. She bears us not with pain, but with the rejoicings of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. She, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, feeds us, not with the milk of the body, but with that of the Apostle, wherewith he fed the tender age of the people who were still children. <span class="stiki" id="note343189"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> For what bride has more children than <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, who is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in her <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and a mother to her people, whose fertility even <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture attests, saying, <q>For many more are the children of the desolate than of her that has an husband</q>?  She has not an husband, but she has a Bridegroom, inasmuch as she, whether as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among nations, or as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in individuals, without any loss of modesty, she weds the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> as her <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Spouse, free from all injury, full of reason.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p><strong>St. Ambrose exhorts parents to train their children to virginity, and sets before them the troubles arising from their desire to have grandchildren. He says however that he does not forbid marriage, but rather defends it against heretics who oppose it. Still setting virginity before marriage, he speaks of the beauty of their spouse, and of the gifts wherewith He adorns them, and applies to these points certain verses of the Song of Songs.</strong></p>

<p>32. You have heard, O <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, in what <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and pursuits you ought to train your daughters, that you may possess those by whose merits your faults may be redeemed. The virgin is an offering for her mother, by whose daily <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the divine power is appeased. A virgin is the inseparable pledge of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who neither troubles them for a dowry, nor forsakes them, nor injures them in word or deed. </p>

<p>33. But some one perhaps wishes to have grandchildren, and to be called grandfather. In the first place, such a one gives up what is his own, while seeking what is another's, and is already losing what is certain, while hoping to gain what is uncertain; he gives away his own riches, and still more is asked for; if he does not pay the dowry, it is exacted; if he lives long, he becomes a burden. This is to buy a son-in-law, not to gain one who would sell a sight of their daughter to her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Was she borne so long in her mother's womb in order that she might pass under the power of another? And so the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> take the charge of setting off their virgin that she may so be the sooner removed from them.</p>

<p>34. Some one may say, Do you, then, discourage marriage? Nay, I encourage it, and condemn those who are wont to discourage it, so much so, that indeed I am wont to speak of the marriages of Sarah, Rebecca, and Rachel, and other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of old time, as instances of singular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For he who condemns marriage, condemns the birth of children, and condemns the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, continued by a series of successive generations. For how could generation succeed generation in a continual order, unless the gift of marriage stirred up the desire of offspring? Or how could one set forth that Isaac went to the altar of God as a victim of his father's <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, or that <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, when yet in the body, saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note343192"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;32:28</a></span> and gave a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name to the people while speaking against that whereby they came into being? Those men, though <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, have one point at any rate, wherein they are approved even by the wise <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, that in speaking against marriage they declare that they ought not to have been born.</p>

<p>35. I do not then discourage marriage, but recapitulate the advantages of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. This is the gift of few only, that is of all. And <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> itself cannot exist, unless it have some mode of coming into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. I am comparing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, that it may be clear which is the more excellent. Nor do I allege any opinion of my own, but I repeat that which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> spoke by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Blessed is the barren that is undefiled.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343193"><a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse13">Wisdom&nbsp;3:13</a></span> </p>

<p>36. First of all, in that which those who purpose to marry desire above all things, that they may boast of the beauty of their husband, they must of necessity confess that they are inferior to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, to Whom alone it is suitable to say: <q>You are fairer than the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is poured on Your lips.</q>  Who is that Spouse? One not given to common indulgences, not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of possessing riches, but He Whose throne is for ever and ever. The king's daughters share in His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>: <q>At Your right hand stood the queen in a vesture of gold, clothed with variety of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Hearken, then, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear, and forget your own people and your father's house; for the king has desired your beauty, for He is your God.</q> </p>

<p>37. And observe what a kingdom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> has assigned to you&mdash; gold, and beauty; gold, either because you are the bride of the Eternal King, or because having an unconquered <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, you are not taken captive by the allurements of pleasures, but rulest over them like a queen. Gold again, because as that metal is more precious when tried by fire, so the appearance of the virginal body, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the Divine Spirit, gains an increase of its own comeliness, for who can <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a loveliness greater than the beauty of her who is loved by the King, approved by the judge, dedicated to the Lord, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; ever a bride, ever unmarried, so that neither does <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> suffer an ending, nor modesty loss.</p>

<p>38. This is indeed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> beauty, to which nothing is wanting, which alone is worthy to hear the Lord saying: <q>You are all fair, My <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and no blemish is in you. Come hither from Lebanon, My spouse, come hither from Lebanon. You shall pass and pass through from the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the dens of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343196"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse7">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:7-8</a></span> By which references is set forth the perfect and irreproachable beauty of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the altars of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not moved by perishable things amidst the haunts and dens of spiritual wild beasts, but intent, by the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on being found worthy of the Beloved, Whose breasts are full of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. For <q>wine makes glad the heart of man.</q> </p>

<p>39. <q>The smell of your garments,</q> says He, <q>is above all spices.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343198"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse10">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:10</a></span> And again: <q>And the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343199"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse11">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:11</a></span> See what progress you set forth, O Virgin. Your first odour is above all spices, which were used upon the burying of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note343200"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;19:39</a></span> and the fragrance arises from the mortified motions of the body, and the perishing of the delights of the members. Your second odour, like the odour of Lebanon, exhales the incorruption of the Lord's body, the flower of virginal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p><strong>Taking the passage concerning the honeycomb in the Song of Songs, he expounds it, comparing the sacred virgins to bees.</strong></p>

<p>40. Let, then, your work be as it were a honeycomb, for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is fit to be compared to bees, so laborious is it, so modest, so continent. The bee feeds on dew, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no marriage couch, it makes honey. The virgin's dew is the divine word, for the words of God descend like the dew. The virgin's modesty is unstained nature. The virgin's produce is the fruit of the lips, without bitterness, abounding in sweetness. They work in common, and their fruit is in common.</p>

<p>41. How I wish you, my daughter, to be an imitator of these bees, whose food is flowers, whose offspring is collected and brought together by the mouth. Do imitate her, my daughter. Let no veil of deceit be spread over your words; let them have no covering of guile, that they may be pure, and full of gravity.</p>

<p>42. And let an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> succession of merits be brought forth by your mouth. Gather not for yourself alone (for how do you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> when your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be required of you?), lest leaving your granaries heaped full with grain, which will be a help neither to your life nor to your merits, you be hurried there where you cannot take your treasure with you. Be rich then, but towards the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, that as they share in your nature they may also share your goods.</p>

<p>43. And I also point out to you what flower is to be culled, that one it is Who said: <q>I am the Flower of the field, and the Lily of the valleys, as a lily among thorns,</q>  which is a plain declaration that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are surrounded by the thorns of spiritual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, so that no one can gather the fruit who does not approach with caution.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p><strong>Other passages from the Song of Songs are considered with relation to the present subject, and St. Ambrose exhorting the virgin to seek for Christ, points out where He may be found. A description of His perfections follows, and a comparison is made between virgins and the angels.</strong></p>

<p>44. Take, then, O Virgin, the wings of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that you may fly far above all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, if you wish to attain to Christ: <q>He dwells on high, but beholds lowly things;</q>  and His appearance is as that of a cedar of Lebanon, which has its foliage in the clouds, its roots in the earth. For its beginning is from heaven, its ending on earth, and it produces fruit very close to heaven. Search diligently for so precious a flower, if perchance you may find it in the recesses of your breast, for it is most often to be enjoyed in lowly places.</p>

<p>45. It loves to grow in gardens, in which Susanna, while walking, found it, and was ready to die rather than it should be violated. But what is meant by the gardens He Himself points out, saying: <q>A garden enclosed is My sister, My spouse, a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed;</q>  because in gardens of this kind the water of the pure fountain shines, reflecting the features of the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest its streams mingled with mud from the wallowing places of spiritual wild beasts should be polluted. For this reason, too, that modesty of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> fenced in by the wall of the Spirit is enclosed lest it should lie open to be plundered. And so as a garden inaccessible from without smells of the violet, is scented with the olive, and is resplendent with the rose, that religion may increase in the vine, peace in the olive, and the modesty of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> in the rose. This is the odour of which the patriarch Jacob smelt when he heard his father say: <q>See the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which is full.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343204"><a href="../bible/gen027.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;27:27</a></span> For although the field of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patriarch was full of almost all fruits, the other brought forth its crops with greater labour, the latter flowers.</p>

<p>46. To work, then, O Virgin, and if you wish your garden to be sweet after this sort, enclose it with the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: <q>Set a watch before your mouth, and a door to your lips,</q>  that you, too, may be able to say: <q>As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my Beloved among the sons. In His shadow I delighted and sat down, and His fruit was sweet to my palate.  I found Him Whom my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> loved, I held Him and would not let him go. My beloved came down into His garden to eat the fruit of His trees.  Come, my Beloved, let us go forth into the field.  Set me as a signet upon Your heart, and as a seal upon Your arm.  My Beloved is white and ruddy.</q>  For it is fitting, O Virgin, that you should fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him Whom you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and should recognize in Him all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His Divine Nature and the Body which He has assumed. He is white fittingly, for He is the brightness of the Father; and ruddy, for He was born of a Virgin. The colour of each nature shines and glows in Him. But remember that the marks of His Godhead are more ancient in Him than the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of His body, for He did not take His origin from the Virgin, but, He Who already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> came into the Virgin.</p>

<p>47. He Who was spoiled by the soldiers, Who was wounded by the spear, that He might heal us by the blood of His sacred wounds, will assuredly answer you (for He is meek and lowly of heart, and gentle in aspect): <q>Arise, O north wind, and come, O south, and blow upon My garden, that My spices may flow out.</q>  For from all parts of the world has the perfume of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion increased, and the limbs of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Virgin have glowed. <q>You are beautiful, O my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem.</q>  So it is not the beauty of the perishable body, which will come to an end with sickness or old age, but the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for good deserts, subject to no accidents and never to perish, which is the beauty of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>.</p>

<p>48. And since you are worthy to be compared not now with men but with heavenly beings, whose life you are living on earth, receive from the Lord the precepts you are to observe: <q>Set Me as a signet upon your heart, and as a seal upon your arm;</q>  that clearer <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of your <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and actions may be set forth, in which Christ the Figure of God may shine, Who, equalling fully the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, has expressed the whole which He took of the Father's Godhead. Whence also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says that we are sealed in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note343214"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> since we have in the Son the image of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> the seal of the Son. Let us, then, sealed by this Trinity, take more diligent heed, lest either levity of character or the deceit of any unfaithfulness unseal the pledge which we have received in our hearts.</p>

<p>49. But let <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> secure this for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, for whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> first provided such protection, who, anxious for the prosperity of her tender offspring, herself as a wall with breasts as many towers,  increases her care for them, until, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of hostile attack being at an end, she obtains by the care of a mother's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> peace for her vigorous children. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says: <q>Peace be on your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and abundance in your towers.</q> </p>

<p>50. Then the Lord of peace Himself, after having embraced in His strong arms the vineyards committed to Him, and beholding their shoots putting forth buds, with glad looks, tempers the breezes to the young fruits, as Himself testifies, saying: <q>My vineyard is in My sight, a thousand for Solomon, and two hundred who keep the fruit thereof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343217"><a href="../bible/son008.htm#verse12">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;8:12</a></span> </p>

<p>51. Above it is said: <q>Sixty strong men round about its offspring, armed with drawn swords, and expert in warlike discipline,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343218"><a href="../bible/son003.htm#verse7">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;3:7-8</a></span> here there are a thousand and two hundred. The number has increased, where the fruit has increased, for the more <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> each is, the more is he guarded. So Elisha the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> showed the hosts of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who were present to guard him; so Joshua the son of Nun recognized the Captain of the heavenly host. They, then, who are able also to fight for us are able to guard the fruit that is in us. And for you, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, there is a special guardianship, for you who with unspotted <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> keep the couch of the Lord <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. And no wonder if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> fight for you who <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the mode of life of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Virginal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> merits their guardianship whose life it attains to.</p>

<p>52. Why should I continue the praise of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in more words? For <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> has made even <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. He who has preserved it is an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; he who has lost it a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And hence has religion also gained its name. She is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> who is the bride of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a harlot who makes gods for herself. What shall I say of the resurrection of which you already hold the rewards: <q>For in the resurrection they will neither be given in marriage, nor marry, but shall be,</q> He says, <q>as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343219"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;22:30</a></span> That which is promised to us is already present with you, and the object of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> is with you; you are of this world, and yet not in this world. This age has held you, but has not been able to retain you.</p>

<p>53. But what a great thing it is that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> because of incontinence fell from heaven into this world, that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> because of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> passed from the world into heaven. Blessed <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, whom the delights of the flesh do not allure, nor the defilement of pleasures cast down. Sparing food and abstinence in drink train them in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, seeing they keep them from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the causes of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. That which causes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has often deceived even the just. In this way the people of God after they sat down to eat and drink denied God. <span class="stiki" id="note343220"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse5">Exodus&nbsp;32:5</a></span> In this way, too, <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, and so endured his daughters' <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note343221"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse32">Genesis&nbsp;19:32-33</a></span> So, too, the sons of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> going backward covered their father's nakedness, which he who was wanton saw, he who was modest blushed at and dutifully hid, fearful of offending if he too saw it. <span class="stiki" id="note343222"><a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;9:22</a></span> How great is the power of wine, so that wine made him naked which the waters of the deluge could not.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p><strong>Finally, another glory of virginity is mentioned, that it is free from avarice. St. Ambrose, addressing his sister, reminds her of the great happiness of those who are free from those troubles as to luxury and vanity which come upon those who are about to marry.</strong></p>

<p>What then? What <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> it is that no desire of possessions inflames you! The poor man demands what you have, he does not ask for what you have not. The fruit of your labour is a treasure for the needy, and two mites, if they be all one has, are <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> on the part of the giver.</p>

<p>54. Listen, then, my sister, from what you escape. For it is not for me to teach nor for you to learn what you ought to guard against, for the practice of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not require teaching, but instructs others. You see how like she is to the litters at processions, who lays herself out to please, attracting to herself the look and gaze of all; less beautiful is she because she strives to please, for she displeases the people before she pleases her husband. But in you the rejection of all care for splendour is far more becoming, and the very fact that you do not adorn yourselves is an ornament.</p>

<p>55. Look at the ears pierced with wounds, and pity the neck weighed down with burdens. That the metals are different does not lighten the suffering. In one case a chain binds the neck, in another a fetter encloses the foot. It makes no difference whether the body be loaded with gold or with iron. Thus the neck is weighed down and the steps are hindered. The price makes it no better, except that you <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are afraid lest that which causes you suffering be lost. What is the difference whether the sentence of another or your own condemn you? Nay, you, even more wretched than those, are condemned by public <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since they desire to be set free, you to be bound.</p>

<p>56. But how wretched a position, that she who is marriageable is in a species of sale put up as it were to auction to be bid for, so that he who offers the highest price purchases her. Slaves are sold on more tolerable conditions, for they often choose their masters; if a maiden chooses it is an offense, if not it is an insult. And she, though she be beautiful and comely, both fears and wishes to be seen; she wishes it that she may sell herself for a better price; she fears lest the fact of her being seen should itself be unbecoming. But what absurdities of wishes and fears and suspicions are there as to how the suitors will turn out, lest a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man may beguile her, or a rich one contemn her, lest a handsome suitor mock her, lest a noble one despise her.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p><strong>St. Ambrose answers objections made to the uselessness of his exhortations in favour of virginity, and brings forward instances of virgins especially in various places he mentions, and speaks of their zeal in the cause.</strong></p>

<p>57. Some one may say, you are always singing the praises of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. What shall I do who am always singing them and have no success? But this is not my fault. Then, too, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> come from Placentia to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, or from Bononia, and Mauritania, in order to receive the veil here. You see a striking thing here. I treat the matter here, and persuade those who are elsewhere. If this be so, let me treat the subject elsewhere, that I may persuade you.</p>

<p>58. What is it, then, that even they who hear me not follow my teaching, and those who hear me follow me not? For I have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> many <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who had the desire, but were prevented from going forward by their mothers, and, which is more serious, mothers who were <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, to whom I will now address myself. For if your daughters desired to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, they could, by law, choose whom they would. Are they, then, who are allowed to choose a man not allowed to choose God?</p>

<p>59. Behold how sweet is the fruit of modesty, which has sprung up even in the affections of barbarians. Virgins coming from the most distant on this and that side of Mauritania desire to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> here; and though all the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> be in bonds, yet modesty cannot be bound. She who mourns over the hardship of slavery avows an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom.</p>

<p>60. And what shall I say of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of Bononia, a fertile band of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, who, forsaking worldly delights, inhabit the sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>?  Not being of the sex which lives in common, attaining in their common <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> to the number of twenty, and fruit to an hundredfold, leaving their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> dwelling they press into the houses of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as soldiers of unwearied <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; at one time singing spiritual songs, they provide their sustenance by labour, and seek with their hands supplies for their liberality.</p>

<p>61. But if the attraction of searching for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> has grown strong (for they beyond others follow up the search and watch for purity), they follow up their hidden prey with the greatest perseverance to its very chambers; or, if the flight of any one shall have seemed more free, one may see them rise on the wing, hear the rustling of their feathers, and the bursting of applause; so as to surround the one on wing with a chaste band of modesty, until rejoicing in that fair companionship, forgetful of her father's house, she enters the regions of modesty and the fenced-in home of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p><strong>It is very desirable that parents should encourage the desire for the virgin life, but more praiseworthy when the love of God draws a maiden even against their will. The violence of parents and the loss of property are not to be feared, and an instance of this is related by St. Ambrose.</strong></p>

<p>62. It is a good thing, then, that the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, like favouring gales, should aid a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; but it is more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> if the fire of tender age even without the incitement of those older of its own self burst forth into the flame of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Parents will refuse a dowry, but you have a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> Spouse, satisfied with Whose treasures you will not miss the revenues of a father's inheritance. How much is poverty to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> superior to bridal gifts!</p>

<p>63. And yet of whom have you heard as ever, because of her desire for <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, having been deprived of her lawful inheritance? Parents speak against her, but are willing to be overcome. They resist at first because they are afraid to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; they often are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> that one may learn to overcome; they threaten to disinherit to try whether one is able not to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> temporal loss; they caress with exquisite allurements to see if one cannot be softened by the inducement of various pleasures. You are being exercised, O virgin, while you are being urged. And the anxious entreaties of your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are your first battles. Conquer your affection first, O maiden. If you conquer your home, you conquer the world.</p>

<p>64. But suppose that the loss of your patrimony awaits you; are not the future realms of heaven a compensation for perishable and frail possessions? For if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the heavenly message, <q>there is no one who has forsaken house, or <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive sevenfold more in this present time, and in the world to come shall have everlasting life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343224"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;18:29-30</a></span> Entrust your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who entrust your money to man; lend to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The faithful keeper of the deposit of your hope pays the talent of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with manifold interest. The Truth does not deceive, Justice does not circumvent, Virtue does not deceive. But if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not God's word, at least <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> instances.</p>

<p>65. Within my memory a girl once noble in the world, now more noble in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being urged to a marriage by her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and kinsfolk, took refuge at the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar. Whither could a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> better flee, than there where the Virgin Sacrifice is offered? Nor was even that the limit of her boldness. She, the oblation of modesty, the victim of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, was standing at the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, now placing upon her head the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, asking his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and now impatient at the righteous delay, placing the top of her head under the altar. <q>Can any better veil,</q> she said, <q>cover me better than the altar which consecrates the veils themselves? Such a bridal veil is most suitable on which Christ, the Head of all, is daily <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. What are you doing, my kinsfolk? Why do you still trouble my mind with seeking marriage? I have long since provided for that. Do you offer me a bridegroom? I have found a better. Make the most you can of my <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, boast of his nobility, extol his power, I have Him with Whom no one can compare himself, rich in the world, powerful in empire, noble in heaven. If you have such an one, I do not reject the choice; if you do not find such, you do me not a kindness, my <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, but an injury.</q></p>

<p>66. When the others were silent, one burst forth somewhat roughly: <q>If,</q> he said, <q>your father were alive, would he suffer you to remain unmarried?</q> Then she replied with more religion and more restrained <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>: <q>And perchance he is gone that no one may be able to hinder me.</q> Which answer concerning her father, but warning as to himself, he made good by his own speedy death. So the others, each of them, fearing the same for himself, began to assist and not to hinder her as before, and her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> involved not the loss of the property due to her, but also received the reward of her integrity. You see, maidens, the reward of devotion, and do you, <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, be warned by the example of transgression.</p>
