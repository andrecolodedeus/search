<h1>Concerning Virginity (Book III)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p><strong>St. Ambrose now goes back to the address of Liberius when he gave the veil to Marcellina. Touching on the crowds pressing to the bridal feast of that Spouse Who feeds them all, he passes on to the fitness of her profession on the day on which Christ was born of a Virgin, and concludes with a fervent exhortation to love Him.</strong></p>

<p>1. Inasmuch as I have digressed in what I have said in the two former hooks, it is now time, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sister, to reconsider those precepts of Liberius  of blessed memory which you used to talk over with me, as the holier the man the more pleasing is his discourse. For he, when on the Nativity of the Saviour in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of St. Peter you signified your profession of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> by your change of attire  (and what day could be better than that on which the Virgin received her child?) while many <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> were standing round and vying with each other for your companionship. <q>You,</q> said he, <q>my daughter, have desired a good espousal. You see how great a crowd has come together for the birthday of your Spouse, and none has gone away without food. This is He, Who, when invited to the marriage feast, changed water into wine. <span class="stiki" id="note343257"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;2:9</a></span> He, too, will confer the pure sacrament of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> on you who before were subject to the vile elements of material nature. This is He Who fed four thousand in the wilderness with five loaves and two fishes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343258"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;9:13</a></span> He could have fed more; if more had been there to be fed, they would have been. And now He has called many to your espousal, but it is not now barley bread, but the Body from heaven which is supplied.</p>

<p>2. Today, indeed, He was born after the manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of a Virgin, but was begotten of the Father before all things, resembling His mother in body, His Father in power. Only-begotten on earth, and Only-begotten in heaven. God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, born of a Virgin, Righteousness from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Power from the Mighty One, Light of Light, not unequal to His Father; nor separated in power, not confused by extension of the Word or enlargement as though mingled with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but distinguished from the Father by virtue of His generation. He is your Brother, <span class="stiki" id="note343259"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse1">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;5:1</a></span> without Whom neither things in heaven, nor things in the sea, nor things on earth consist. The good Word of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Which was, it is said, <q>in the beginning,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343260"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> here you have His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <q>And,</q> it is said, <q>the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343261"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Here you have His power, undivided and inseparable from the Father. <q>And the Word was God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343262"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Here you have His unbegotten Godhead, for your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to be drawn from the mutual relationship.</p>

<p>3. Love him, my daughter, for He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For, <q>None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> save God only.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343263"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;18:19</a></span> For if there be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there is certainly no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that God the Son is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Love Him I say. He it is Whom the Father begot before the morning star,  as being <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, He brought Him forth from the womb as the Son; He uttered him from His heart,  as the Word. He it is in Whom the Father is well pleased; <span class="stiki" id="note343266"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;17:5</a></span> He is the Arm of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for He is Creator of all, and the Wisdom <span class="stiki" id="note343267"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse30">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:30</a></span> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for He proceeded from the mouth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note343268"><!--k28--<a href="../bible/wis024.htm#verse3">Wisdom&nbsp;24:3</a></span> the Power of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily. <span class="stiki" id="note343269"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse9">Colossians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> And the Father so loved Him, as to bear Him in His bosom, and place Him at His right hand, that you may learn His wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His power.</p>

<p>4. If, then, Christ is the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was God ever without power? Was the Father ever without the Son? If the Father of a certainty always was, of a certainty the Son always was. So He is the perfect Son of a perfect Father. For he who derogates from the power, derogates from Him Whose is the power. The Perfection of the Godhead does not admit of inequality. Love, then, Him Whom the Father loves, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Him Whom the Father honours, for <q>he that honours not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, honours not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343270"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;5:23</a></span> and <q>whoso denies the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, has not the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343271"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:23</a></span> So much as to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p><strong>Touching next upon the training of a virgin, he speaks of moderation in food and drink, and of restraint upon the impulses of the mind, introducing some teaching upon the fable of the death and resurrection of Hippolytus, and advises the avoidance of certain meats.</strong></p>

<p>5. But sometimes even when <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to be relied upon, youth is not trusted. Use wine, therefore, sparingly, in order that the weakness of the body may not increase, not for pleasurable excitement, for each alike kindles a flame, both wine and youth. Let <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> also put a bridle on tender age, and spare diet restrain the unsubdued appetites with a kind of rein. Let reason check, hope subdue, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> curb them. For he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not how to govern his desires, like a man run away with by wild horses, is overthrown, bruised, torn, and injured.</p>

<p>6. And this is said to have happened to a youth for his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Diana. But the fable is coloured with poet's tales, that Neptune, stirred with grief at his rival being preferred, sent <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> upon his horses, whereby his great power might be set forth in that he overcame the youth, not by strength, but by fraud. And from this event a yearly <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is celebrated for Diana, when a horse is offered at her altar. And they say that she was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and (of which even harlots would be ashamed) yet could <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one who did not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> her. But as far as I am concerned let their fables have authority, for though each be criminal, it is yet a less <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that a youth should have been so enamoured of an adulteress as to perish, than that two gods should, as they relate, contend for committing <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and that Jupiter avenged the grief of his daughter who played the harlot on the physician who cured the wound of him who had violated Diana in the woods, a most excellent huntress, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, not of wild beasts, but of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: yet also of wild beasts, so that she was worshipped naked.</p>

<p>7. Let them ascribe, then, to Neptune the mastery over <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, in order to fix on him the crime of unchaste <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Let them ascribe to Diana the rule over the woods, wherein she dwelt, so as to establish the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> which she practised. Let them ascribe to &AElig;sculapius the restoration of the dead so long as they confess that when struck by lightning he himself escaped not. Let them also ascribe to Jupiter the thunderbolts which he did not possess, so that they <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the disgrace with which he was laden.</p>

<p>8. And I think that one should sparingly eat all kinds of food which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> heat to the limbs, for flesh drags down even eagles as they fly. But within you let that bird of which we read, <q>Your youth shall be renewed like the eagle's,</q>  holding its course on high, swift in its virgin flight, be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the desire for unnecessary food. The gathering of banquets and salutations must be avoided.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p><strong>Virgins are exhorted to avoid visits, to observe modesty, to be silent during the celebration of the Mysteries after the example of Mary. Then after narrating the story of a heathen youth, and saying of a poet, St. Ambrose relates a miracle wrought by a holy priest.</strong></p>

<p>9. I will, too, that visits among the younger, except such as may be due to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and those of like age, be few. For modesty is worn away by intercourse, and boldness breaks forth, laughter creeps in, and bashfulness is lessened, while politeness is studied. Not to answer one who asks a question is childishness, to answer is nonsense. I should prefer, therefore, that conversation should rather be wanting to a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, than abound. For if <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are bidden to keep silence in churches, even about divine things, and to ask their husbands at home, what do we think should be the caution of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, in whom modesty adorns their age, and silence commends their modesty.</p>

<p>10. Was it a small sign of modesty that when Rebecca came to wed Isaac, and saw her bridegroom, she took a veil, <span class="stiki" id="note343273"><a href="../bible/gen024.htm#verse65">Genesis&nbsp;24:65</a></span> that she might not be seen before they were united? Certainly the fair virgin feared not for her beauty, but for her modesty. What of Rachel, how she, when Jacob's <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> had been taken, <span class="stiki" id="note343274"><a href="../bible/gen029.htm#verse11">Genesis&nbsp;29:11</a></span> wept and groaned, and would not have ceased weeping had she not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> him to be a kinsman? So she both observed what was due to modesty, and omitted not kindly affection. But if it is said to a man: <q>Gaze not on a maid, lest she <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to fall,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343275"><a href="../bible/sir009.htm#verse5">Sirach&nbsp;9:5</a></span> what is to be said to a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> virgin, who, if she loves, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in mind; if she is loved, in act also?</p>

<p>11. The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of silence, especially in Church, is very great. Let no sentence of the divine lessons escape you; if you give ear, restrain your voice, utter no word with your lips which you would wish to recall, but let your boldness to speak be sparing. For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in much speaking there is abundance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note343276"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse19">Proverbs&nbsp;10:19</a></span> To the murderer it was said: <q>You have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, be silent,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343277"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;4:7</a></span> that he might not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more; but to the virgin it must be said, <q>Be silent lest you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> For Mary, as we read, kept in heart all things that were said concerning her Son, <span class="stiki" id="note343278"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;2:19</a></span> and do you, when any passage is read where Christ is announced as about to come, or is shown to have come, not make a noise by talking, but attend. Is anything more unbecoming than the divine words should be so drowned by talking, as not to be heard, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, or made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> should be indistinctly heard through the sound of voices, that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should be hindered when offered for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all?</p>

<p>12. The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> pay respect to their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> by silence, of which this instance is given: As Alexander, the king of the Macedonians, was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a>, the sleeve of a barbarian lad who was lighting the lamp for him caught fire and burnt his body, yet he remained without moving and neither betrayed the pain by a groan, nor showed his suffering by silent tears. Such was the discipline of reverence in a barbarian lad that nature was subdued. Yet he feared not the gods, who were no gods, but the king. For why should he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> those who if the same fire had caught them would have burnt?</p>

<p>13. How much better still is it where a youth at his father's banquet is bidden not to betray by coarse gestures his unchaste loves. And do you, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> virgin, abstain from groans, cries, coughing, and laughter at the Mystery. Can you not at the Mystery do what he did at a banquet? Let <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> be first marked by the voice, let modesty close the mouth, let religion remove weakness, and habit instruct nature. Let her gravity first announce a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> to me, a modest approach, a sober gait, a bashful countenance, and let the march of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> be preceded by the evidence of integrity. That virgin is not sufficiently worthy of approval who has to be enquired about when she is seen.</p>

<p>14. There is common story how, when the excessive croaking of frogs was resounding in the ears of the faithful people, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of God bade them be silent, and show reverence to the sacred words, and then at once the noise was stilled. Shall then the marshes keep silence and not the frogs? And shall irrational animals re-acknowledge by reverence what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not by nature? While the shamelessness of men is such, that many care not to pay that respect to the religious feelings of their minds, which they do to the pleasure of their ears.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p><strong>Having summed up the address of Liberius, St. Ambrose passes on to the virtues of his sister, especially her fasts, which however he advises her to moderate to some extent, and to exercise herself in other matters, after the example which he adduces. Especially he recommends the Lord's Prayer, and the repetition of Psalms by night, and the recitation of the Creed before daylight.</strong></p>

<p>15. After such a fashion did Liberius of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory address you, in words beyond the reality of practice in most cases, but coming short of your performance, who have not only attained to the whole of discipline by your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but have surpassed it in your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. For we are bidden to practise <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, but only for single days; but you, multiplying nights and days, pass untold periods without food, and if ever requested to partake of some, and to lay aside your book a little while, you at once answer: <q>Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343279"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;4:4</a></span> Your very meals consisted but of what food came to hand, so that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is to be preferred to eating what was repugnant; your drink is from the spring, your weeping and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> combine, your sleep is on your book.</p>

<p>16. These kings were suited to younger years, while he was ripening with the gray hairs of age; but when a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> has gained the triumph over her subdued body, she should lessen her toil, that she may be preserved as teacher for a younger age. The vine laden with the fruitful branches of full growth soon breaks unless it be from time to time kept back. But while it is young let it grow rank, and as it grows older be pruned, so as not to grow into a forest of twigs, or die deprived of life by its exceptive produce. A good husbandman by tending the soil keeps the vine in excellent order, protects it from cold, and guards it from being parched by the mid-day sun. And he works his land by turns, or if he will not let it lie fallow, he alternates his crops, so that the fields may rest through change of produce. Do you too, a veteran in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, at least sow the fields of your breast with different seeds, at one time with moderate sustenance, at another with sparing <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, with reading, work, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that change of toil may be as a truce for rest.</p>

<p>17. The whole land does not produce the same harvest. On one side vines grow on the hills, on another you can see the purple olives, elsewhere the scented roses. And after leaving the plough, the strong husbandman with his fingers scrapes the soil to plant the roots of flowers, and with the rough hands wherewith he turns the bullocks striving among the vines, he gently presses the udders of the sheep. The land is the better the more numerous are its fruits. So do you, following the example of a good husbandman, avoid cleaving your soil with perpetual <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> as if with deep ploughings. Let the rose of modesty bloom in your garden, and the lily of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and let the violet beds drink from the source of sacred blood. There is a common saying, <q>What you wish to perform abundantly, sometimes do not do at all.</q> There ought to be something to add to the days of Lent, but so that nothing be done for the sake of ostentation, but of religion.</p>

<p>18. Frequent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> also commends us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>Seven times a day have I praised You,</q>  though he was busy with the affairs of a kingdom, what ought we to do, who read: <q>Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note343281"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;26:41</a></span> Certainly our customary <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> ought to be said with giving of thanks, when we rise from sleep, when we go forth, when we prepare to receive food, after receiving it, and at the hour of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>,  when at last we are going to rest.</p>

<p>19. And again in your bed-chamber itself, I would have you join psalms in frequent interchange with the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a>, either when you wake up, or before sleep bedews your body, so that at the very commencement of rest sleep may find you free from the care of worldly matters, meditating upon the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, indeed, he who first found out the name of Philosophy itself,  every day before he went to rest, had the flute-player play softer melodies to soothe his mind disturbed by worldly cares. But he, like a man washing tiles, fruitlessly desired to drive away worldly things by worldly means, for he was, indeed, rather besmearing himself with fresh mud, in seeking a reward from pleasure, but let us, having wiped off the filth of earthly <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, purify our utmost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from every defilement of the flesh.</p>

<p>20. We ought, also, specially to repeat the Creed, as a seal upon our hearts, daily, before light, and to recur to it in thought whenever we are in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of anything. For when is the soldier in his tent or the warrior in battle without his military <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p><strong>St. Ambrose, speaking of tears, explains David's saying, <q>Every night wash l my couch with my tears,</q> and goes on to speak of Christ bearing our griefs and infirmities. Everything should be referred to His honour, and we ought to rejoice with spiritual joy, but not after a worldly fashion.</strong></p>

<p>21. And who can now fail to understand that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said for our instruction: <q>Every night will I wash my couch and water my bed with my tears</q>?  For if you take it literally for his bed, he shows that such abundance of tears should be shed as to wash the bed and water it with tears, the couch of him who is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, for weeping has to do with the present, rewards with the future, since it is said: <q>Blessed are you that weep, for you shall laugh;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343285"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;6:21</a></span> or if we take the word of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> as applied to our bodies, we must wash away the offenses of the body with tears of penitence. For Solomon made himself a bed of wood from Lebanon, its pillars were of silver, its bottom of gold, its back strewn with gems. <span class="stiki" id="note343286"><a href="../bible/son003.htm#verse6">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;3:6</a></span> What is that bed but the fashion of our body? For by gems is set forth the splendour of the brightness of the air, fire is set forth by the gold, water by silver, and earth by wood, of which four elements the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body consists, in which our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rests, if it do not exist deprived of rest by the roughness of hills or the damp ground, but raised on high, above <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, supported by the wood. For which reason David also says: <q>The Lord will send him help upon his bed of pain.</q>  For how can that be a bed of pain which cannot feel pain, and which has no feeling? But the body of pain is like the body of that death, of which it is said: <q>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343288"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24</a></span> </p>

<p>22. And since I have inserted a clause in which mention is made of the Lord's Body, lest any one should be troubled at reading that the Lord took a body of pain, let him remember that the Lord grieved and wept over the death of Lazarus, <span class="stiki" id="note343289"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;11:35</a></span> and was wounded in His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, and that from the wound there went forth blood and water, <span class="stiki" id="note343290"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;19:34</a></span> and that He gave up His Spirit. Water for washing, Blood for drink, the Spirit for His rising again. For Christ alone is to us hope, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>&mdash; hope in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the laver, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in the sacrament.</p>

<p>23. And as He took a body of pain, so too He turned His bed in His weakness,  for He converted it to the benefit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh. For by His Passion weakness was ended, and death by His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. And yet you ought to mourn for the world but to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, to be sad for penitence but joyful for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, though, too, the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by a wholesome precept has bidden to weep with them that weep, and to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with them that do <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note343292"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;12:15</a></span> </p>

<p>24. But let him who desires to solve the whole difficulty of this question have recourse to the same Apostle. <q>Whatsoever you do,</q> says he, <q>in word or deed, do all in the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father by Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343293"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse17">Colossians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> Let us then refer all our words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who brought life out of death, and created light out of darkness. For as a sick body is at one time cherished by warmth, at another soothed by cool applications, and the variation of remedies, if carried out according to the direction of the physician, is healthful, but if done in opposition to his orders increases the sickness; so whatever is paid to Christ is a remedy, whatever is done by our own will is harmful.</p>

<p>25. There ought then to be the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, conscious of right, not excited by unrestrained feasts, or nuptial concerts, for in such modesty is not safe, and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> may be suspected where excessive dancing accompanies festivities. I desire that the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of God should be far from this. For as a certain teacher of this world has said: <q>No one dances when sober unless he is mad.</q>  Now if, according to the wisdom of this world, either <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> or <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of dancing, what a warning is given to us among the instances mentioned in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>, where John, the forerunner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, being beheaded at the wish of a dancer, is an instance that the allurements of dancing did more harm than the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p><strong>Having mentioned the Baptist, St. Ambrose enters into a description of the events concerning his death, and speaks against dancing and the festivities of the wicked.</strong></p>

<p>26. And since we must not cursorily pass by the mention of so great a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, let us consider who he was, by whom, on what account, how, and at what time he was slain. A just man, he is <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by adulterers, and the penalty of a capital crime is turned off by the guilty on to the judge. Again the reward of the dancer is the death of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. Lastly (a matter of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> even to all barbarians), the cruel sentence is given in the midst of banqueting and festivities, and the news of the deadly crime is carried from the banquet to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and then from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to the banquet. How many crimes are there in one <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> act!</p>

<p>27. A banquet of death is set out with royal luxury,  and when a larger concourse than usual had come together, the daughter of the queen, sent for from within the private apartments, is brought forth to dance in the sight of men. What could she have learned from an adulteress but loss of modesty? Is anything so conducive to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> as with unseemly movements thus to expose in nakedness those parts of the body which either nature has hidden or custom has veiled, to sport with the looks, to turn the neck, to loosen the hair? Fitly was the next step an offense against God. For what modesty can there be where there is dancing and noise and clapping of hands?</p>

<p>28. <q>Then,</q> it is said, <q>the king being pleased, said unto the damsel, that she should ask of the king whatsoever she would. Then he swore that if she asked he would give her even the half of his kingdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343296"><a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse22">Mark&nbsp;6:22-23</a></span> See how worldly men themselves judge of their worldly power, so as to give even kingdoms for dancing. But the damsel, being taught by her mother, demanded that the head of John should be brought to her on a dish. That which is said that <q>the king was sorry,</q>  is not repentance on the part of the king, but a confession of guilt, which is, according to the wont of the divine rule, that they who have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> condemn themselves by their own confession. <q>But for their sakes which sat with him,</q> it is said. What is more base than that a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> should be committed in order not to displease those who sat at meat? <q>And,</q> it follows, <q>for his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath's</a> sake.</q> What a new religion! He had better have forsworn himself. The Lord therefore in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> bids us not to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> at all, <span class="stiki" id="note343298"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;5:34</a></span> that there be no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, and no need of offending. And so an innocent man is slain that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> be not violated. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> which to have in the greatest horror. <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">Perjury</a> is more endurable than are the oaths of tyrants.</p>

<p>29. Who would not think when he saw some one running from the banquet to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note343299"><a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse27">Mark&nbsp;6:27</a></span> that orders had been given to set the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> free? Who, I say, having heard that it was <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> birthday, and of the state banquet, and the choice given to the damsel of choosing whatever she wished, would not think that the man was sent to set John free? What has cruelty in common with delicacies? What have death and pleasure in common? The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is hurried to suffer at a festal time by a festal order, by which he would even wish to be set free; he is slain by the sword, and his head is brought on a platter. This dish was well suited to their cruelty, in order that their insatiate savageness might be feasted.</p>

<p>30. Look, most savage king, at the sights worthy of your feast. Stretch forth your right hand, that nothing be wanting to your cruelty, that streams of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> blood may pour down between your fingers. And since the hunger for such unheard-of cruelty could not be satisfied by banquets, nor the thirst by goblets, drink the blood pouring from the still flowing veins of the cut-off head. Behold those eyes, even in death, the witnesses of your crime, turning away from the sight of the delicacies. The eyes are closing, not so much owing to death, as to horror of luxury. That bloodless golden mouth, whose sentence you could not endure, is silent, and yet you fear. Yet the tongue, which even after death is wont to observe its duty as when living, condemned, though with trembling motion, the incest. This head is borne to <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a>: she rejoices, she exults as though she had escaped from the crime, because she has slain her judge.</p>

<p>31. What say you, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>? Do you see what you ought to teach, and what also to unteach your daughters? She dances, but she is the daughter of an adulteress. But she who is modest, she who is chaste, let her teach her daughter religion, not dancing. And do you, grave and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> men, learn to avoid the banquets of hateful men. If such are the banquets, what will be the judgment of the impious?</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p><strong>In reply to Marcellina, who had asked what should be thought of those who to escape violence killed themselves, St. Ambrose replies by narrating the history of Pelagia, a virgin, with her mother and sister, and goes on to speak of the martyrdom of the blessed Sotheris, one of their own ancestors.</strong></p>

<p>32. As I am drawing near the close of my address, you make a good suggestion, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sister, that I should touch upon what we ought to think of the merits of those who have cast themselves down from a height, or have drowned themselves in a river, lest they should fall into the hands of persecutors, seeing that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture forbids a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to lay hands on himself. And indeed as regards <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> placed in the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of preserving their purity, we have a plain answer, seeing that there exists an instance of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<p>33. Saint Pelagia  lived formerly at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, being about fifteen years old, a sister of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> herself. She shut herself up at home at the first sound of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, seeing herself surrounded by those who would rob her of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and purity, in the absence of her mother and sisters, without any defence, but all the more filled with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>What are we to do, unless,</q> says she to herself, <q>you, a captive of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, takest thought? I both wish and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to die, for I meet not death but seek it. Let us die if we are allowed, or if they will not allow it, still let us die. God is not offended by a remedy against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> permits the act. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if we think of the real meaning of the word, how can what is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> be <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>? It is rather <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to wish to die and not to be able. And we do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> any difficulty. For who is there who wishes to die and is not able to do so, when there are so many easy ways to death? For I can now rush upon the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> altars and overthrow them, and quench with my blood the kindled fires. I am not afraid that my right hand may fail to deliver the blow, or that my breast may shrink from the pain. I shall leave no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to my flesh. I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not that a sword will be wanting. I can die by my own weapons, I can die without the help of an executioner, in my mother's bosom.</q></p>

<p>34. She is said to have adorned her head, and to have put on a bridal dress, so that one would say that she was going to a bridegroom, not to death. But when the hateful persecutors saw that they had lost the prey of her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, they began to seek her mother and sisters. But they, by a spiritual flight, already held the field of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, when, as on the one side, persecutors suddenly threatened them, and on the other, escape was shut off by an impetuous river, they said, what do we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? See the water, what hinders us from being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? And this is the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven, and kingdoms are sought. This is a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> after which no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Let the water receive us, which is wont to regenerate. Let the water receive us, which makes <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Let the water receive us, which opens heaven, protects the weak, hides death, makes <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> You, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Creator of all things, let not the water scatter our bodies, deprived of the breath of life; let not death separate our obsequies, whose lives affection has always conjoined; but let our constancy be one, our death one, and our burial also be one.</p>

<p>35. Having said these words, and having slightly girded up the bosom of their dress, to veil their modesty without impeding their steps, joining hands as though to lead a dance, they went forward to the middle of the river bed, directing their steps to where the stream was more violent, and the depth more abrupt. No one drew back, no one ceased to go on, no one tried where to place her steps, they were anxious only when they felt the ground, grieved when the water was shallow, and glad when it was deep. One could see the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother tightening her grasp, rejoicing in her pledges, afraid of a fall lest even the stream should carry off her daughters from her. <q>These victims, O Christ,</q> said she, <q>do I offer as leaders of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, guides on my journey, and companions of my sufferings.</q></p>

<p>37. But who would have <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to wonder that they had such constancy while alive, seeing that even when dead they preserved the position of their bodies unmoved? The water did not lay bare their corpses, nor did the rapid course of the river roll them along. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother, though without sensation, still maintained her loving grasp, and held the sacred knot which she had tied, and loosed not her hold in death, that she who had paid her debt to religion might die leaving her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> as her heir. For those whom she had joined together with herself for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, she claimed even to the tomb.</p>

<p>38. But why use instances of people of another race to you, my sister, whom the inspiration of hereditary <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> has taught by descent from a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> ancestor? For whence have you learned who had no one from whom to learn, living in the country, with no virgin companion, instructed by no teacher? You have played the part then not of a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, for this cannot be done without teaching, but of an heir of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>39. For how could it come to pass that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Sotheris should not have been the originator of your purpose, who is an ancestor of your race? Who, in an age of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, borne to the heights of suffering by the insults of slaves, gave to the executioner even her face, which is usually free from injury when the whole body is tortured, and rather beholds than suffers torments; so brave and patient that when she offered her tender cheeks to punishment, the executioner failed in striking before the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> yielded under the injuries. She moved not her face, she turned not away her countenance, she uttered not a groan or a tear. Lastly, when she had overcome other kinds of punishment, she found the sword which she desired.</p>
