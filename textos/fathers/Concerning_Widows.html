<h1>Concerning Widows</h1>

<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<p>The writer informs us himself at the beginning of his treatise that he felt moved by the example of St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, after speaking about <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, to continue with the subject of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. But there was also another matter in his own diocese which touched him personally, and caused him at once to take up the matter. A certain <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who had several daughters, some married already and others of marriageable age, began to think of a second marriage for herself. St. Ambrose, partly for her own sake, partly that it might not be supposed that he had in any way advised the step, published the following treatise.</p>

<p>In the first place he affirms that the profession of widowhood comes very close to that of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and is to be esteemed far above the married state. He proves this by the testimony of St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and by his description of one who is a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> indeed; also by many examples taken both from the old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Having mentioned St. Peter's wife's mother, he turns more particularly to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> for whose sake he is writing, though he avoids mentioning her name, pointing out how really empty and insufficient are all the reasons she is setting before herself for marrying again. The marriage bond is, indeed, he says, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and good, and the married and single are as various kinds of flowers in the field of the church. There is, however, more grain produced than lilies, more that is married than virgin. He points out that widowhood has been held in dishonour by idolaters alone, for which reason it may well be held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. St. Ambrose does not condemn a second marriage, though placing widowhood before it, as being bound to aim at leading those committed to his loving care to the highest possible degree of perfection.</p>

<p>The treatise was written not long after that concerning Virgins, that is, soon after a.d. 377. </p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>After having written about <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, it seemed needful to say something concerning <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, since the Apostle joins the two classes together, and the latter are as it were teachers of the former, and far superior to those who are married. Elijah was sent to a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, a great mark of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; yet <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> are not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> like her of Sarepta, unless they copy her <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, notably hospitality. The <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> of men is rebuked, who forfeit the promises of God by their grasping.</p>

<p>1. Since I have treated of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in three books, it is fitting now, my brethren, that a treatise concerning <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> should come in order; for I ought not to leave them without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, nor to separate them from the commendation belonging to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, since the voice of the Apostle has joined them to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, according to what is written: <q>The unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and the virgin cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in body and in spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343302"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse34">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:34</a></span> For in a certain manner the inculcation of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is strengthened by the example of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. They who have preserved their marriage bed undefiled are a testimony to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> that <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is to be preserved for God. And it is almost a mark of no less <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to abstain from marriage, which was once a delight, than to remain <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the pleasures of wedlock. They are strong in each point, in that they regret not wedlock, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of which they keep, and entangle not themselves with wedded pleasures, lest they appear weak and not able to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>2. But in this particular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is contained also the prizes of liberty. For: <q>The wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her husband fall asleep she is freed: let her marry whom she will, only in the Lord. But she will be happier if she so abide, after my judgment, for I think I also have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343303"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse39">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:39-40</a></span> Evidently, then, the Apostle has expressed the difference, having said that the one is bound, and stated that the other is happier, and that he asserts not so much as the result of his own judgment, as of the infusion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>; that the decision should be seen to be heavenly, not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>.</p>

<p>3. And what is the teaching of the fact that at that time when the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> was afflicted by famine and Elias was sent to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>?  And see how for each is reserved her own special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is sent to the Virgin, <span class="stiki" id="note343305"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;1:26-27</a></span> a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. Notice, farther, that in one case it is Gabriel, in the other Elisha. The most excellent chiefs of the number of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are seen to be chosen. But there is no praise simply in widowhood, unless there be added the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of widowhood. For, indeed, there were many <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, but one is preferred to all, in which fact it is not so much that others are called back from their pursuit as that they are stimulated by the example of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>4. What is said at first makes the ears attentive, although the simplicity itself of the understanding has weight to attract <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> to the pattern of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; since each seems to excel, not according to her profession, but her merit, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of hospitality is not lost sight of by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who, as He Himself related in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, rewards a cup of cold water with the exceeding recompense of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and compensates the small measure of meal and oil by an unfailing abundance of plenty ever coming in. For if one of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>  has said that all the possessions of friends should be common, how much more ought those of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> to be common! For we are <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> who are bound into one body.</p>

<p>5. But we are not bound by any prescribed limit of hospitality. For why do you think that what is of this world is private property when this world is common? Or why do you consider the fruits of the earth are private, when the earth itself is common property? <q>Behold,</q> He said, <q>the fowls of the air, they sow not, neither do they reap.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343307"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;6:26</a></span> For to those to whom nothing is private property nothing is wanting, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the master of His own word, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to keep His promise. Again, the birds do not gather together, and yet they eat, for our heavenly Father feeds them. But we turning aside the warnings of a general utterance to our private advantage, God says: <q>Every tree which has in it the fruit of a tree yielding seed shall be to you for meat, and to every beast, and to every bird, and to everything that creeps upon the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343308"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse29">Genesis&nbsp;1:29-30</a></span> By gathering together we come to want, and by gathering together we are made empty. For we cannot hope for the promise, who keep not the saying. It is also good for us to attend to the precept of hospitality, to be ready to give to strangers, for we, too, are strangers in the world.</p>

<p>6. But how <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> was that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, who, when pinched by extreme hunger, observed the reverence due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was not using the food for herself alone, but was dividing it with her son, that she might not outlive her dear offspring. Great is the duty of affection, but that of religion brings more return. For as no one ought to be set before her son, so the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of God ought to be set before her son and her preservation. For she is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have given to him not a little food, but the whole support of her life, who left nothing for herself. So hospitable was she that she gave the whole, so full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> at once.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>The precepts of the Apostle concerning a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> indeed are laid down, such as, that she bring up children, attend to her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, desire to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, show herself irreproachable, set forth a ripeness of merits, have been the wife of one man. St. Ambrose notes, however, that a second marriage was not condemned by St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and adds that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> must have a good report for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with all. The reasons why younger <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> are to be avoided, and what is meant by its being better to marry than to burn. St. Ambrose then goes on to speak of the dignity of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, shown by the fact that any injury done to them is visited by the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>7. So, then, a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> is not only marked off by bodily abstinence, but is distinguished by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to whom I do not give commandments, but the Apostle. I am not the only person to do them <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Gentiles</a> did so first, when he said: <q>Honour <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> that are <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> indeed. But if any <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> have children or nephews, let her first learn to govern her own house, and to requite her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343309"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:3-4</a></span> Whence we observe that each inclination of affection ought to exist in a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> her children and to do her duty to her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. So when discharging her duty to her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> she is teaching her children, and is rewarded herself by her own compliance with duty, in that what she performs for others benefits herself.</p>

<p>8. <q>For this,</q> says he, <q>is acceptable with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343310"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:3-4</a></span> So that if you, O <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, carest for the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you ought to follow after that which you have learned to be well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, indeed, the Apostle somewhat farther back, <span class="stiki" id="note343311"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse34">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:34</a></span> exhorting <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> to the pursuit of continence, said that they mind the things of the Lord. But elsewhere, when a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who is approved is to be selected, she is bidden not only to bear in mind but also to hope in the Lord: <q>For she that is a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> indeed,</q> it is said, <q>and desolate, must hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and be instant in supplications and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> night and day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343312"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:5</a></span> And not without reason does he show that these ought to be blameless, to whom, as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> works are enjoined, so, too, great respect is paid, so that they are honoured even by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</p>

<p>9. And of what kind she ought to be who is chosen the description is given in the words of the teacher himself: <q>Not less than threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343313"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:9</a></span> Not that old age alone makes the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>,  but that the merits of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> are the duties of old age. For she certainly is the more noble who represses the heat of youth, and the impetuous ardour of youthful age, desiring neither the tenderness of a husband, nor the abundant delights of children, rather than one who, now worn out in body, cold in age, of ripe years, can neither grow warm with pleasures, nor hope for offspring.</p>

<p>10. Nor in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is any one excluded from the devotion of widowhood, if after entering upon a second marriage, which the precepts of the Apostle certainly do not condemn as though the fruit of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> were lost, if she be again loosed from her husband. She will have, indeed, the merit of her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, even if it be tardy, but she will be more approved who has tried a second marriage, for the desire of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is conspicuous in her, for the other old age or shame seems to have put an end to marrying.</p>

<p>11. Nor yet is bodily <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> alone the strong purpose of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, but a large and most abundant exercise of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. <q>Well reported of for good works, if she have brought up children; if she have lodged strangers; if she have washed the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> feet; if she have ministered to those suffering tribulation; if, lastly, she have followed after every good work.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343315"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:10</a></span> You see how many practices of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> he has included. He demands, first of all, the duty of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; secondly, the practice of hospitality and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> service; thirdly, the ministry of mercy and liberality in assisting; and, lastly, the performance of every good work.</p>

<p>12. And he, therefore, that the younger should be avoided, <span class="stiki" id="note343316"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:11</a></span> because they are not able to fulfil the requirements of so high a degree of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For youth is prone to fall because the heat of various desires is inflamed by the warmth of glowing youth, and it is the part of a good doctor to keep off the materials of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the first exercise in training the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to turn away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the second to implant <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Yet, since the Apostle <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that Anna, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of fourscore years, from her youth was a herald of the works of the Lord, I do not think that he thought that the younger should be excluded from the devotion of widowhood, especially as he said: <q>It is better to marry than to burn.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343317"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:9</a></span> For certainly he recommended marriage as a remedy, that she who would else perish might be saved; he did not prescribe the choice that one who could contain should not follow <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, for it is one thing to succour one who is falling, another to persuade to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>13. And what shall I say of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgments, since in the judgments of God the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are set forth as having offended the Lord in nothing more than violating what was due to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> and the rights of minors? This is proclaimed by the voices of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which brought upon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> the penalty of rejection. This is mentioned as the only <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which will mitigate the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God against their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and execute <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment for minors, for thus we read: <q>Judge the fatherless, deal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and come let us reason together, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343318"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse17">Isaiah&nbsp;1:17</a></span> And elsewhere: <q>The Lord shall maintain the orphan and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>.</q>  And again: <q>I will abundantly bless her <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>.</q>  Wherein also the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is foreshadowed. You see, then, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, that that office which is honoured by the assistance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> must not be degraded by impure desire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>St. Ambrose returns to the story of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Sarepta, and shows that she represented the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, hence that she was an example to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. Then he refers to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> as setting forth Christ, inasmuch as he foretold the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and the rain which was to come. Next he touches upon and explains the twofold sign of Gideon, and points out that it is not in every one's power to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and that the Incarnation of Christ and the rejection of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were foreshadowed in that account.</p>

<p>14. To return to what was treated of above,  what is the meaning of the fact that when there was a very great famine in all the land, yet the care of God was not wanting to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was sent to sustain her? And when in this story the Lord warns me that He is about to speak in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note343322"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;4:25</a></span> He seems to bid my ears attend to a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. For what can be more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> than the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Not, then, without a purpose is one preferred among many <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. Who is such an one, to whom so great a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who was carried up into heaven, should be guided, especially at that time when the heaven was shut for three years and six months, when there was a great famine in the whole land? The famine was everywhere, and yet notwithstanding this <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> did not want. What are these three years? Are they not, perchance, those in which the Lord came to the earth and could not find fruit on the fig-tree, according to that which is written: <q>Behold, there are three years that I came seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343323"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;13:7</a></span> </p>

<p>15. This is assuredly that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of whom it was said: <q>Rejoice, you barren that bearest not, break forth and cry, you that availest not with child; for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her who has an husband.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343324"><a href="../bible/isa054.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;54:1</a></span> And well is she a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of whom it is well said: <q>You shall not remember your shame and your widowhood, for I am the Lord Who make you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343325"><a href="../bible/isa054.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;54:4</a></span> And perchance therefore is she a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who has lost her Husband indeed in the suffering of His body, but in the day of judgment shall receive again the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> Whom she seemed to have lost. <q>For a short time have I forsaken you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343326"><a href="../bible/isa054.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;54:7</a></span> He says, in order that, being forsaken, she may the more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> keep her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>16. All, then, have an example to imitate, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. And perchance is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> therefore a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, married, and a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, because they are one body in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. She is then that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> for Whose sake when there was a dearth of the heavenly Word on earth, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were appointed, for there was a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who was barren, yet reserved her bringing forth for its own time.</p>

<p>17. So that his person does not seem to us of small account, who by his word moistened the dry earth with the dew of heaven, and unlocked the closed heavens certainly not by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power. For who is he who can open the heavens except Christ, for Whom daily out of sinners' food is gathered, an increase for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? For it is not in the power of man to say: <q>The barrel of meal shall not waste, and the cruse of oil shall not fail, until the day on which the Lord shall send rain on the earth.</q>  For though it be the rule of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to speak thus, the voice is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that of the Lord. And so it is stated first: <q>For thus says the Lord.</q>  For it is of the Lord to vouch for a continuance of heavenly <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and to promise that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of spiritual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> shall not fail, to grant the defences of life, the seals of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the gifts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.</p>

<p>18. But what does this mean: <q>Until the day on which the Lord shall send rain on the earth</q>? Except that He, too, <q>shall come down like rain upon a fleece, and like the drops that water the earth.</q>  In which passage is disclosed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the old history where Gideon, the warrior of the mystic conflict, receiving the pledge of future victory, recognized the spiritual sacrament in the vision of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that that rain was the dew of the Divine Word, which first came down on the fleece, when all the earth was parched with continual drought, and by a second <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sign, moistened the floor of all the earth with a shower, while dryness was upon the fleece. </p>

<p>19. For the prescient man observed the sign of the future growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For first in Jud&aelig;a the dew of the divine utterance began to give moisture (for <q>in Jewry is God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a></q>),  while the whole earth remained without the dew of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But when Joseph's flock began to deny <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by venturing on various enormous offenses to incur guilt before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then when the dew of the heavenly shower was poured on the whole earth, the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> began to grow dry and parched in their own unbelief, when the clouds of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and the healthful shower of the Apostles watered the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church gathered together from all parts of the world. This is that rain, now condensed from earthly moisture, now from mountain mists, but diffused throughout the whole world in the salutary shower of the heavenly Scriptures.</p>

<p>20. By this example, then, it is shown that not all can merit the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of divine power, but they who are aided by the pursuits of religious devotion, and that they lose the fruits of divine working who are devoid of reverence for heaven. It is also shown in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, in order to restore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, took upon Himself the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, casting off the Jewish people, from whom the counsellor and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the divine benefits were taken away, <span class="stiki" id="note343332"><a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;3:2</a></span> because that as it were by a kind of national blemish they were not willing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>By the example of Anna St. Ambrose shows what ought to be the life of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and shows that she was an example of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> at every age. From this he argues that there are three degrees of the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, all of which are included in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and sets forth several examples in Mary, in Anna, and in Susanna. But, he adds, the state of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is superior to either of the others, but that a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> ought to take greater care for the preservation of her good name.</p>

<p>21. <span class="sc">Scripture</span> then teaches as how much <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred by unity, and how great is the gift of divine blessing in <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. And since such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is given them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must observe what mode of life corresponds thereto; for Anna shows what <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> ought to be, who, left destitute by the early death of her husband, yet obtained the reward of full praise, being intent not less on the duties of religion than on the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. A <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, it is said, of fourscore and four years, a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who departed not from the temple, a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who served God night and day with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note343333"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;2:36-37</a></span> </p>

<p>22. You see what sort of person a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> is said to be, the wife of one man, tested also by the progress of age, vigorous in religion, and worn out in body, whose resting-place is the temple, whose conversation is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, whose life is <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, who in the times of day and night by a service of unwearied devotion, though the body acknowledge old age, yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no age in her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Thus is a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> trained from her youth, thus is she spoken of in her age, who has kept her widowhood not through the chance of time, nor through weakness of body, but by large-heartedness in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For when it is said that she was for seven years from her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> with her husband, it is a setting forth that the things which are the support of her old age began in the aims of her youth.</p>

<p>23. And so we are taught that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is threefold, one kind that of married life, a second that of widowhood, and the third that of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, for we do not so set forth one as to exclude others. These result each in that which belongs to each. The training of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is rich in this, that it has those whom it may set before others, but has none whom it rejects, and would that it never could have any! We have so spoken of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> as not to reject widowhood, we so reverence <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> as to reserve its own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for wedlock. It is not our precepts but the divine sayings which teach this.</p>

<p>24. Let us remember then how Mary, how Anna, and how Susanna are spoken of. But since not only must we celebrate their praises but also follow their manner of life, let us remember where Susanna,  and Anna, <span class="stiki" id="note343335"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse37">Luke&nbsp;2:37</a></span> and Mary <span class="stiki" id="note343336"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;1:28</a></span> are found, and observe how each is spoken of with her special commendation, and where each is mentioned, she that is married in the garden, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> in the temple, the virgin in her secret chamber.</p>

<p>25. But in the former the fruit is later, in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> it is earlier; old age proves them, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is the praise of youth, and does not need the help of years, being the fruit of every age. It becomes early years, it adorns youth, it adds to the dignity of age, and at all ages it has the gray hairs of its righteousness, the ripeness of its gravity, the veil of modesty, which does hinder devotion and increases religion. For we see by what follows that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Mary went every year with Joseph to Jerusalem on the solemn day of the passover. <span class="stiki" id="note343337"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;2:41</a></span> Everywhere in company with the Virgin is eager devotion and a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> sharer of her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Nor is the Mother of the Lord puffed up, as though secure of her own merits, but the more she recognized her merit, the more fully did she pay her vows, the more abundantly did she perform her service, the more fully did she discharge her office, the more religiously did she perform her duty and fill up the mystic time.</p>

<p>26. How much more then does it beseem you to be intent on the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, lest you leave any place for unfavourable opinion who have the evidence of your modesty and your behaviour alone. For a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, though in her also character rather than the body has the first claim, puts away <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> by the integrity of her body, a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who has lost the assistance of being able to prove her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> undergoes the inquiry as to her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> not according to the word of a midwife, but according to her own manner of life. Scripture, then, has shown how attentive and religious should be the disposition of a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>Liberality to the poor is recommended by the example of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, whose two mites were preferred to the large gifts of the rich. The two mites are treated as <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> representing the two Testaments. What that treasure is for which we are taught to offer, after the example of the wise men, three gifts, or after that of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, two. St. Ambrose concludes the chapter by an exhortation to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in good works.</p>

<p>27. In the same book, too, but in another place, we are taught how fitting it is to be merciful and liberal towards the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and that this feeling should not be checked by the consideration of our poverty, since liberality is determined not by the amount of our possessions, but by the disposition of giving. For by the voice of the Lord that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> is preferred to all of whom it was said: <q>This <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> has cast in more than all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343338"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;21:3</a></span> In which instance the Lord characteristically teaches all, that none should be held back from giving assistance through shame at his own poverty, and that the rich should not flatter themselves that they seem to give more than the poor. For the piece of money out of a small stock is richer than treasures out of abundance, because it is not the amount that is given but the amount that remains which is considered. No one gives more than she who has left nothing for herself.</p>

<p>28. Why do you, rich <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, boast yourself by comparison with the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and when you are all loaded with gold, and drag along the ground a costly robe, desire to be honoured as though she were inferior and small in comparison with your riches, because you have surpassed the needy with your gifts? Rivers too overflow, when they are too full, but a draught from a brook is more pleasant. New wine foams while fermenting, and the husbandman does not consider as lost that which runs over. While the harvest is being threshed out, grains of grain fall from the groaning floor; but though the harvests fail, the barrel of meal wastes not, and the cruse full of oil gives forth.  But the draught emptied the casks of the rich, while the tiny cruse of oil of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> gave abundance. That, then, is to be reckoned which you give for devotion, not what you cast forth disdainfully. For in fine, no one gave more than she who fed the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> with her children's nourishment. And so since no one gave more, no one had greater merit. This has a moral application.</p>

<p>29. And considering the mystical sense, one must not despise this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> casting in two mites into the treasury. Plainly the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was noble who in the divine judgment was found worthy to be preferred to all. Perchance it is she who of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has given two testaments for the help of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and so no one has done more. Nor could any one equal the amount of her gift, who joined <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with mercy. Do you, then, whoever you are, who exercise your life the practice of widowhood, not hesitate to cast into the treasury the two mites, full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>30. Happy is she who out of her treasure brings forth the perfect image of the King. Your treasure is wisdom, your treasure is <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and righteousness, your treasure is a good understanding, such as was that treasure from which the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, when they worshipped the Lord, brought forth gold, frankincense, and myrrh; <span class="stiki" id="note343340"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;2:11</a></span> setting forth by gold the power of a king, venerating God by the frankincense, and by myrrh acknowledging the resurrection of the body. You too have this treasure if you look into yourself: <q>For we have this treasure in earthen vessels.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343341"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> You have gold which you can give, for God does not exact of you the precious gift of shining metal, but that gold which at the day of judgment the fire shall be unable to consume. Nor does He require precious gifts, but the good odour of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which the altars of your heart send forth and the disposition of a religious mind exhales.</p>

<p>31. From this treasure, then, not only the three gifts of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> but also the two mites of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> are taken, on which the perfect image of the heavenly King shines forth, the brightness of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the image of His substance. Precious, too, are those hardly earned gains of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> which the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> gives of her labour and daily task, continually night and day working at her task, and by the wakeful labour of her profitable <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> gathering treasure; that she may preserve the couch of her deceased husband unviolated, be able to support her dear children, and to minister to the poor. She is to be preferred to the rich, she it is who shall not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the judgment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>32. Strive to equal her, my daughters: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> affected in a good thing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343342"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse18">Galatians&nbsp;4:18</a></span> <q>Covet earnestly the best gifts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343343"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:31</a></span> The Lord is ever looking upon you, Jesus looks upon you when He goes to the treasury, and you think that of the gain of your good works assistance is to be given to those in need. What is it, then, that you should give your two mites and gain in return the Lord's Body? Go not, then, empty into the sight of the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note343344"><a href="../bible/exo034.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;34:20</a></span> empty of mercy, empty of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, empty of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; for the Lord Jesus is wont to look upon and to commend not the empty, but those who are rich in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Let the maiden see you at work, let her see you ministering to others. For this is the return which you owe to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you should make your return to God from the progress of others. No return is more acceptable to God than the offerings of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>Naomi is an instance of a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> receiving back from her daughter-in-law the fruits of her own good training, and is a token that necessary support will never fail the good <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. And if her life appears sad, she is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, since the promises of the Lord are made to her. St. Ambrose then touches upon the benefits of weeping.</p>

<p>33. Does the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> Naomi seem to you of small account, who supported her widowhood on the gleanings from another's harvest,  and who, when heavy with age, was supported by her daughter-in-law? <span class="stiki" id="note343345"><a href="../bible/rut002.htm#verse2">Ruth&nbsp;2:2</a></span> It is a great benefit both for the support and for the advantage of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, that they so train their daughters-in-law as to have in them a support in full old age, and, as it were, payment for their teaching and reward for their training. For to her who has well taught and well instructed her daughter-in-law a Ruth will never be wanting who will prefer the widowed life of her mother-in-law to her father's house, and if her husband also be dead, will not leave her, will support her in need, comfort her in sorrow, and not leave her if sent away; for good instruction will never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> want. So that Naomi, deprived of her husband and her two sons, having lost the offspring of her fruitfulness, lost not the reward of her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> care, for she found both a comfort in sorrow and a support in poverty.</p>

<p>34. You see, then, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, how fruitful a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> is in the offspring of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and the results of her own merits, which cannot come to an end. A good <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, then, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no want, and if she be weary through age, in extreme poverty, yet she has as a rule the reward of the training she has given. Though the nearest to herself have failed, she finds those not so near akin to cherish their mother, revere their parent, and by the trifling gifts for her support desire to gain the fruit of their own kindness, for richly are gifts to a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> repaid. She asks food and pays back treasures.</p>

<p>35. But she seems to spend sad days, and to pass her time in tears. And she is the more <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in this, for by a little weeping she purchases for herself everlasting joys, and at the cost of a few moments gains <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. To such it is well said: <q>Blessed are you that weep, for you shall laugh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343346"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;6:21</a></span> Who then would prefer the deceitful appearances of present joys to the pleasure of future freedom from anxiety? Does he seem to us an insignificant authority, the elect forefather of the Lord after the flesh, who ate ashes as it were bread, and mingled his drink with weeping,  and by his tears at night gained for himself the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of redemption in the morning? Whence did he gain that great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> except that he greatly wept, and, as it were, at the price of his tears obtained the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of future <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for himself.</p>

<p>36. The <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> has, then, this excellent recommendation, that while she mourns her husband she also weeps for the world, and the redeeming tears are ready, which shed for the dead will benefit the living. The weeping of the eyes is fitted to the sadness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it arouses pity, lessens labour, relieves grief, and preserves modesty, and she no longer seems to herself so wretched, finding comfort in tears which are the pay of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>By the example of Judith is shown that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> is not wanting in <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>; her preparation for her visit to Holofernes is dwelt upon, as also her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and her wisdom, her sobriety and moderation. Lastly, St. Ambrose, after demonstrating that she was no less brave than <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, sets forth her modesty after her success.</p>

<p>37. But <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> also is usually not wanting to a good <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. For this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>, which surpasses the usual nature and the weakness of the sex by the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, such as was in her who was named Judith,  who of herself alone was able to rouse up from utter prostration and defend from the enemy men broken down by the siege, smitten with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and pining with hunger. For she, as we read, when Holofernes, dreaded after his success in so many battles, had driven countless thousands of men within the walls; when the armed men were afraid, and were already treating about the final surrender, went forth outside the wall, both excelling that army which she delivered, and braver than that which she put to flight.</p>

<p>38. But in order to learn the dispositions of ripe widowhood, run through the course of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. From the time when her husband died she laid aside the garments of mirth, and took those of mourning. Every day she was intent on <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> except on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a> and the times of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> days, not as yielding to desire of refreshment, but out of respect for religion. For this is that which is said: <q>Whether you eat or drink, all is to be done in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343349"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:31</a></span> that even the very refreshment of the body is to have respect to the worship of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion. So then, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Judith,  strengthened by lengthened mourning and by daily <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, sought not the enjoyments of the world regardless of danger, and strong in her contempt for death. In order to accomplish her stratagem she put on that robe of mirth, wherewith in her husband's lifetime she was wont to be clothed, as though she would give pleasure to her husband, if she freed her country. But she saw another man whom she was seeking to please, even Him, of Whom it is said: <q>After me comes a Man Who is preferred before me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343351"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;1:30</a></span> And she did well in resuming her bridal ornaments when about to fight, for the reminders of wedlock are the arms of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and in no other way could a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> please or gain the victory.</p>

<p>39. Why relate the sequel? How she among thousands of enemies, remained chaste. Why speak of her wisdom, in that she designed such a scheme? She chose out the commander, to ward off from herself the insolence of inferiors, and prepare an opportunity for victory. She reserved the merit of abstinence and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. For unpolluted, as we read, either by food or by <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, she gained no less a triumph over the enemy by preserving her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> than by delivering her country.</p>

<p>40. What shall I say of her sobriety? Temperance, indeed, is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. When the men were intoxicated with wine and buried in sleep, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> took the sword, put forth her hand, cut off the warrior's head, and passed unharmed through the midst of the ranks of the enemy. You notice, then, how much <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> can injure a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, seeing that wine so weakens men that they are overcome by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Let a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, then, be temperate, pure in the first place from wine, that she may be pure from <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. He will tempt you in vain, if wine tempts you not. For if Judith had drunk she would have slept with the adulterer. But because she drank not, the sobriety of one without difficulty was able both to overcome and to escape from a drunken army.</p>

<p>41. And this was not so much a work of her hands, as much more a trophy of her wisdom. For having overcome Holofernes by her hand alone, she overcame the whole army of the enemies by her wisdom. For hanging up the head of Holofernes, a deed which the wisdom of the men had been unable to plan, she raised the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of her countrymen, and broke down that of the enemy. She stirred up her own friends by her modesty, and struck terror into the enemy so that they were put to flight and slain. And so the <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and sobriety of one <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> not only subdued her own nature, but, which is far more, even made men more brave.</p>

<p>42. And yet she was not so elated by this success, though she might well <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and exult by right of her victory, as to give up the exercises of her widowhood, but refusing all who desired to wed her she laid aside her garments of mirth and took again those of her widowhood, not caring for the adornments of her triumph, thinking those things better whereby <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of the body are subdued than those whereby the weapons of an enemy are overcome.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>Though many other <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> came near to Judith in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, St. Ambrose proposes to speak of Deborah only. What a pattern of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> she must have been for <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, who was chosen to govern and defend men. It was no small <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to her that when her son was over the host he refused to go forth to battle unless she would go also. So that she led the army and foretold the result. In this story the conflicts and triumphs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and her spiritual weapons, are set forth, and every excuse of weakness is taken from <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</p>

<p>43. And in order that it may not seem as if only one <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> had fulfilled this inimitable work, it seems in no way doubtful that there were many others of equal or almost equal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for good seed grain usually bears many ears filled with grains. Doubt not, then, that that ancient seed-time was fruitful in the characters of many <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. But as it would be tedious to include all, consider some, and especially Deborah,  whose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> Scripture records for us.</p>

<p>44. For she showed not only that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> have no need of the help of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as she, not at all restrained by the weakness of her sex, undertook to perform the duties of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and did even more than she had undertaken. And, at last, when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were being ruled under the leadership of the judges, because they could not govern them with manly <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or defend them with manly strength, and so <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> broke out on all sides, they chose Deborah,  by whose judgment they might be ruled. And so one <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> both ruled many thousands of men in peace, and defended them from the enemy. There were many judges in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but no <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> before was a judge, as after Joshua there were many judges but none was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. And I think that her judgeship has been narrated, and her <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> described,  that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> should not be restrained from <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of valour by the weakness of their sex. A <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, she governs the people; a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, she leads armies; a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, she chooses generals; a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, she determines <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and orders triumphs. So, then, it is not nature which is answerable for the fault or which is liable to weakness. It is not sex, but valour which makes strong.</p>

<p>45. And in time of peace there is no complaint, and no fault is found in this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whereas most of the judges were causes of no small <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to the people. But when the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaanites</a>, a people fierce in battle and rich in troops, successively joined them, showed a horrible disposition against the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, this <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, before all others, made all the preparations for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. And to show that the needs of the household were not dependent on the public resources, but rather that public duties were guided by the discipline of home life, she brings forth from her home her son as leader of the army, that we may acknowledge that a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> can train a warrior; whom, as a mother, she taught, and, as judge, placed in command, as, being herself brave, she trained him, and, as a prophetess, sent to certain victory.</p>

<p>46. And lastly, her son Barak shows the chief part of the victory was in the hands of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> when he said: <q>If you will not go with me I will not go, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the day on which the Lord sends His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> with me.</q>  How great, then, was the might of that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to whom the leader of the army says, <q>If you will not go I will not go.</q> How great, I say, the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who keeps not back her son from dangers through motherly affection, but rather with the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of a mother exhorts her son to go forth to victory, while saying that the decisive point of that victory is in the hand of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>!</p>

<p>47. So, then, Deborah foretold the event of the battle. Barak, as he was bidden, led forth the army; Jael carried off the triumph, for the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Deborah fought for her, who in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> revealed to us the rising of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, for whom should be found a triumph over Sisera, that is, over the powers opposed to her. For us, then, the oracles of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> fought, for us those judgments and arms of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> won the victory. And for this reason it was not the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> but Jael who gained the victory over the enemy. Unhappy, then, was that people which could not follow up by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the enemy, whom it had put to flight. And so by their fault <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> came to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, by their sluggishness the victory was reserved for us.</p>

<p>48. Jael then destroyed Sisera, whom however the band of Jewish veterans had put to flight under their brilliant  leader, for this is the interpretation of the name Barak; for often, as we read, the sayings and merits of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> procured heavenly aid for the fathers. But even at that time was victory being prepared over spiritual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> for those to whom it is said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Come, you blessed of My Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343356"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;25:34</a></span> So the commencement of the victory was from the Fathers, its conclusion is in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>49. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not overcome the powers of the enemy with weapons of this world, but with spiritual arms, <q>which are mighty through God to the destruction of strongholds and the high places of spiritual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343357"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4</a></span> And Sisera's thirst was quenched with a bowl of milk, because he was overcome by wisdom, for what is healthful for us as food is deadly and weakening to the power of the enemy. The weapons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the weapons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which overcomes the enemy.</p>

<p>50. And so according to this history a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, that the minds of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> might be stirred up, became a judge, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> set all in order, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> prophesied, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> triumphed, and joining in the battle array taught men to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> under a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> lead. But in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> it is the battle of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the victory of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>51. You, then, who are <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have no excuse because of your nature. You who are <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> have no excuse because of the weakness of your sex, nor can you attribute your changeableness to the loss of the support of a husband. Every one has sufficient protection if <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> is not wanting to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And the very advance of age is a common defence of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> for <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>; and grief for the husband who is lost, regular work, the care of the house, anxiety for children, frequently ward off wantonness hurtful to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; while the very mourning attire, the funeral solemnities, the constant weeping, and grief impressed on the sad brow in deep wrinkles, restrains wanton eyes, checks <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, turns away forward looks. The sorrow of regretful affection is a good guardian of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, guilt cannot find an entrance if vigilance be not wanting.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>To an objection that the state of widowhood might indeed be endurable if circumstances were pleasant, St. Ambrose replies that pleasant surroundings are more dangerous than even trouble; and goes to show by examples taken from <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> may find much <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in their children and their sons-in-law. They should have recourse to the Apostles, who are able to help us, and should entreat for the intercessions of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. He touches then on certain complaints respecting loneliness, and care of property, and ends by pointing out the unseemliness of a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> marrying who has daughters either married already or of marriageable age.</p>

<p>52. You have learned, then, you who are <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, that you are not destitute of the help of nature, and that you can maintain sound counsel. Nor, again, are you devoid of protection at home, who are able to claim even the highest point of public power.</p>

<p>53. But perhaps some one may say that widowhood is more endurable for her who enjoys prosperity, but that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> are soon broken down by adversity, and easily succumb. On which point not only are we taught by experience that enjoyment is more perilous for <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> than difficulties, but by the examples in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that even in weakness <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> are not usually without aid, <span class="stiki" id="note343358"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:16</a></span> and that divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> support is furnished more readily to them than to others, if they have brought up children and chosen sons-in-law well. And, finally, when Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with violent fever, Peter and Andrew besought the Lord for her: <q>And He stood over her and commanded the fever and it left her, and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343359"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;4:39</a></span> </p>

<p>54. <q>She was taken,</q> it is said, <q>with a great fever, and they besought him for her.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343360"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;4:38</a></span> You too have those near you to entreat for you. You have the Apostles near, you have the Martyrs near; if associated with the Martyrs in devotion, you draw near them also by works of mercy. Do you show mercy and you will be close to Peter. It is not relationship by blood but affinity of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which makes near, for we walk not in the flesh but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>. Cherish, then, the nearness of Peter and the affinity of Andrew, that they may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you and your <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> give way. Touched by the word of God you, who lay on the earth, will then immediately rise up to minister to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <q>For our conversation is in heaven, whence also we look for the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343361"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;3:20</a></span> For no one lying down can minister to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Minister to the poor and you have ministered to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <q>For what you have done unto one of these,</q> He says, <q>you have done unto Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343362"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;25:40</a></span> You, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, have then assistance, if you choose such sons-in-law for yourselves, such patrons and friends for your posterity.</p>

<p>55. So Peter and Andrew <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. Would that there were some one who could so quickly <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, or better still, they who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the mother-in-law, Peter and Andrew his brother. Then they could <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for one related to them, now they are able to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us and for all. For you see that one bound by great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is less fit to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for herself, certainly less likely to obtain for herself. Let her then make use of others to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for her to the physician. For the sick, unless the physician be called to them by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of others, cannot <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for themselves. The flesh is weak, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sick and hindered by the chains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and cannot direct its feeble steps to the throne of that physician. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> must be entreated for us, who have been to us as guards; the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> must be entreated, whose patronage we seem to claim for ourselves by the pledge as it were of their bodily remains. They can entreat for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, who, if they had any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, washed them in their own blood; for they are the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our leaders, the beholders of our life and of our actions. Let us not be ashamed to take them as intercessors for our weakness, for they themselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the weaknesses of the body, even when they overcame.</p>

<p>56. So, then, Peter's mother-in-law found some to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for her. And you, O <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, find those who will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you, if as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> and desolate you hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, continue instant in supplications, persist in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note343363"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:5</a></span> treat your body as dying daily, that by dying you may live again; avoid pleasures, that you, too, being sick, may be healed. <q>For she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343364"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:6</a></span> </p>

<p>57. You have no longer any reason for marrying, you have some to intercede for you. Say not, <q>I am desolate.</q> This is the complaint of one who wishes to marry. Say not, <q>I am alone.</q> Chastity seeks solitude: the modest seek privacy, the immodest company. But you have necessary business; you have also one to plead for you. You are afraid of your adversary; the Lord Himself will intervene with the judge and say: <q>Judge for the fatherless, and justify the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343365"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse17">Isaiah&nbsp;1:17</a></span> </p>

<p>58. But you wish to take care of your inheritance. The inheritance of modesty is greater, and this a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> can guard better than one married. A slave has done wrong. Forgive him, for it is better that you should bear with another's fault than expose it. But you wish to marry. Be it so. The simple desire is no crime. I do not ask the reason, why is one invented? If you think it good, say so; if unsuitable, be silent. Do not blame <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do not blame your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, saying that protection fails you. Would that the wish did not fail! And say not that you are consulting the interests of your children, whom you are depriving of their mother.</p>

<p>59. There are some things permissible in the abstract, but not permissible on account of age. Why is the bridal of the mother being prepared at the same time with that of the daughters, and often even afterwards? Why does the grown-up daughter learn to blush in the presence of her mother's <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> rather than her own? I confess that I advised you to change your dress, but not to put on a bridal veil; to go away from the tomb, not to prepare a bridal couch. What is the meaning of a newly-married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who already has sons-in-law? How unseemly it is to have children younger than one's grand-children!</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>St. Ambrose returns again to the subject of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, speaking of His goodness in all misery. The various ways in which the good Physician treats our diseases, and the quickness of the healing if only we do not neglect to call upon Him. He touches upon the moral meaning of the will, which he shows was manifested in Peter's mother-in-law, and lastly points out what a minister of Christ and specially a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ought to be, and says that they specially must rise through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>60. But let us return to the point, and not, while we are grieving over the wounds of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, leave the physician, and while ministering to the sores of others, let our own go on increasing. The Physician is then here asked for. Do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, because the Lord is great, that perhaps He will not condescend to come to one who is sick, for He often comes to us from heaven; and is wont to visit not only the rich but also the poor and the servants of the poor. <span class="stiki" id="note343366"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;4:18</a></span> And so now He comes, when called upon, to Peter's mother-in-law. <q>And He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343367"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;4:38</a></span> As He is worthy of being remembered, so, too, is He worthy of being longed for, worthy, too, of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for His condescension to every single matter which affects men, and His marvellous acts. He disdains not to visit <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and to enter the narrow rooms of a poor cottage. As God He commands, as man He visits.</p>

<p>61. Thanks be to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, by means of which we also, who saw not Christ when He came into this world, seem to be with Him when we read His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, that as they, to whom He drew near, borrowed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from Him, so may He, when we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, draw near to us.</p>

<p>62. Do you see what kinds of healing are with Him? He commands the fever, He commands the unclean spirits, at another place He lays hands on them. He was wont then to heal the sick, not only by word but also by touch. And do you then, who burn with many desires, taken either by the beauty or by the fortune of some one, implore Christ, call in the Physician, stretch forth your right hand to Him, let the hand of God touch your inmost being, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the heavenly Word enter the veins of your inward desires, let God's right hand strike the secrets of your heart. He spreads clay on the eyes of some that they may see, <span class="stiki" id="note343368"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;9:6</a></span> and the Creator of all teaches us that we ought to be mindful of our own nature, and to discern the vileness of our body; for no one can see divine things except one who through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his vileness cannot be puffed up. Another is bidden to show himself to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, that he may for ever be free from the scales of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note343369"><a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;5:14</a></span> For he alone can preserve his purity, both of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to show himself to that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Whom we have received as an Advocate for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to Whom is plainly said: <q>You are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever after the order of Melchisedech.</q> </p>

<p>63. And be not afraid that there will be any delay in healing. He who is healed by Christ has no hindrances. You must use the remedy which you have received; and as soon as He has given the command, the blind man sees, the paralytic walks, the dumb speaks, the deaf hears, she that has a fever ministers, the lunatic is delivered. And do you, then, who ever after an unseemly fashion languish for desire of anything, entreat the Lord, show Him your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> no delay. Where there is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the Word is present, desire is put to flight, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> departs. And be not afraid of offending by confession, take it rather as a right, for you who were before afflicted by an intense disease of the body will begin to minister to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>64. And in this place can be seen the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Peter's mother-in-law, from which she received for herself, as it were, the seed grain of what was to come, for to each his will is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that which is to come. For from the will springs wisdom, which the wise man takes in marriage to himself, saying: <q>I desire to make her my spouse.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343371"><a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse2">Wisdom&nbsp;8:2</a></span> This will, then, which at first was weak and languid under the fever of various desires, afterwards by the office of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> rose up strong to minister unto Christ.</p>

<p>65. At the same time it is also shown what he ought to be who ministers to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for first he must be free from the enticements of various pleasures, he must be free from inward languor of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that he may minister the Body and Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For no one who is sick with his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and far from being whole, can minister the remedies of the healing of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. See what you do, O <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and touch not the Body of Christ with a fevered hand. First be healed that you may be able to minister. If Christ bids those who are now cleansed, but were once <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprous</a>, to show themselves to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note343372"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;17:14</a></span> how much more is it fitting for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> himself to be pure. That <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, then, cannot take it ill that I have not spared her, since I spare not myself.</p>

<p>66. Peter's mother-in-law, it is written, rose up and ministered to them. Well is it said, rose up, for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the apostleship was already furnishing a type of the sacrament. It is proper to the ministers of Christ to rise, according to that which is written: <q>Awake, you that sleepest, and arise from the dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343373"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;5:14</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>Having shown that the pretexts usually alleged for second marriages have no weight, St. Ambrose declares that he does not condemn them, though from the Apostle's words he sets forth their inconveniences, though the state of those twice married is approved in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and he takes occasion to advert to those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who forbid them. And he says that it is because the strength of different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> varies that <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is not commanded, but only recommended.</p>

<p>67. I say, then, that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> who have been in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of giving neither are in want of their necessary expenses, nor of help, who in very great dangers have often guarded the resources of their husbands; and further, I think that the good offices of a husband are usually made up for to them by sons-in-law and other <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, and that God's mercy is more ready to help them, and therefore, when there is no special <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for marrying, the desire of so doing should not exist.</p>

<p>68. This, however, I say as a counsel, we do not order it as a precept, stirring up the wills of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> rather than binding them. For I do not forbid second marriages, only I do not advise them. The consideration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness is one thing, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is another. I say more, I do not forbid second, but do not approve of often repeated marriages, for not everything is expedient which is lawful: <q>All things are lawful to me,</q> says the Apostle, <q>but all things are not expedient.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343374"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> As, also, to drink wine is lawful, but, for the most part, it is not expedient.</p>

<p>69. It is then lawful to marry, but it is more seemly to abstain, for there are bonds in marriage. Do you ask what bonds? <q>The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is under a husband is bound by the law so long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343375"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;7:2</a></span> It is then <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that marriage is a bond by which the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is bound and from which she is loosed. Beautiful is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but the bondage is more constant. <q>The wife has not power of her own body, but the husband.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343376"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:4</a></span> And lest this bondage should seem to be rather one of sex than of marriage, there follows: <q>Likewise, also, the husband has not power of his own body, but the wife.</q> How great; then, is the constraint in marriage, which subjects even the stronger to the other; for by mutual constraint each is bound to serve. Nor if one wishes to refrain can he withdraw his neck from the yoke, for he is subject to the incontinence of the other. It is said: <q>You are bought with a price, be not servants of men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343377"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:23</a></span> You see how plainly the servitude of marriage is defined. It is not I who say this, but the Apostle; or, rather, it is not he, but Christ, Who spoke in him. And he spoke of this servitude in the case of good married people. For above you read: <q>The unbelieving husband is sanctified by his believing wife; and the unbelieving wife by her believing husband.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343378"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:14</a></span> And further on: <q>But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not bound in such cases.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343379"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:15</a></span> If, then, a good marriage is servitude, what is a bad one, when they cannot sanctify, but destroy one another?</p>

<p>70. But as I exhort <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> to keep the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of their gift, so, too, I incite <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to observe <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline, for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is made up of all. Though it be the flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, yet some are fed on strong food, others are still nourished with milk, who must be on their guard against those wolves who are hidden in sheep's clothing, pretending to all appearance of continence, but inciting to the foulness of incontinence. For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how severe are the burdens of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, since they cannot touch them with the tips of their fingers; they require of others that which is above measure, when they themselves cannot even observe any measure, but rather give way under the cruel weight. For the measure of the burden must always be according to the strength of him who has to bear it; otherwise, where the bearer is weak, he breaks down with the burden laid upon him; for too strong meat chokes the throats of infants.</p>

<p>71. And so as in a multitude of bearers their strength is not estimated by that of a few; nor do the stronger receive their tasks in accordance with the weakness of others, but each is allowed to bear as great a burden as he desires, the reward increasing with the increase of strength; so, too, a snare is not to be set for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, nor a burden of continence beyond their strength to be taken up, but it must be left to each to weigh the matter for herself, not compelled by the authority of any command, but incited by increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And so for different degrees of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> a different reward is set forth, and one thing is not blamed that another may be praised; but all are spoken of, in order that what is best may be preferred.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>The difference between matters of precept and of counsel is treated of, as shown in the case of the young man in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and the difference of the rewards set forth both for counsels and precepts is spoken of.</p>

<p>72. Marriage, then, is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, but <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, for <q>he that gives his virgin in marriage does well, but he that gives her not in marriage does better.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343380"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:28</a></span> That, then, which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> need not be avoided, but that which is better should be chosen. And so it is not laid upon any, but set before him. And, therefore, the Apostle said well: <q>Concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> I have no commandment of the Lord, yet I give my counsel.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343381"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> For a command is issued to those subject, counsel is given to friends. Where there is a commandment, there is a law; where counsel, there is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. A commandment is given to enforce what is according to nature, a counsel to incite us to follow <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And, therefore, the Law was given to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was reserved for the elect. The Law was given that, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment, it might recall those who were wandering beyond the limits of nature, to their observance, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to incite the elect both by the desire of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and also by the promised rewards.</p>

<p>73. You will see the difference between precept and counsel, if you remember the case of him in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, to whom it is first commanded to do no <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, not to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, not to bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; for that is a commandment which has a penalty for its transgression. But when he said that he had fulfilled all the commandments of the Law, there is given to him a counsel that he should sell all that he had and follow the Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note343382"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;19:18-21</a></span> for these things are not imposed as commands, but are offered as counsels. For there are two ways of commanding things, one by way of precept, the other by way of counsel. And so the Lord in one way says: <q>You shall not kill,</q> where He gives a commandment; in the other He says: <q>If you will be perfect, sell all that you have.</q> He is, then, not bound by a commandment to whom the choice is left.</p>

<p>74. And so they who have fulfilled the commandments are able to say: <q>We are unprofitable servants, we have done that which was our duty to do.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343383"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;17:10</a></span> The virgin does not say this, nor he who sold all his goods, but they rather await the stored-up rewards like the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostle who says: <q>Behold we have forsaken all and followed You, what shall we have therefore?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343384"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;19:27</a></span> He says not, like the unprofitable servant, that he has done that which was his duty to do, but as being profitable to his Master, because he has multiplied the talents entrusted to him by the increase he has gained, having a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and without anxiety as to his merits he expects the reward of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And so it is said to him and the others: <q>You which have followed Me, in the regeneration, when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall sit in the throne of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, shall also yourselves sit upon twelve thrones, judging the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343385"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;19:28</a></span> And to those who had faithfully preserved their talents He promises rewards indeed, though smaller saying: <q>Because you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343386"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;25:21</a></span> Good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, then, is due, but mercy is in the rewards. He who has kept good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has deserved that good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be kept with him; he who has made good profit, because he has not sought his own benefit, has gained a claim to a heavenly reward.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>St. Ambrose, treating of the words in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> concerning eunuchs, condemns those who make themselves such. Those only deserve praise who have through continence gained the victory over themselves, but no one is to be compelled to live this life, as neither Christ nor the Apostle laid down such a law, so that the marriage vow is not to be blamed, though that of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is better.</p>

<p>75. So, then, a commandment to this effect is not given, but a counsel is. Chastity is commanded, entire continence counselled. <q>But all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> cannot receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs which were so born from their mothers womb,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343387"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;25:11-12</a></span> in whom exists a natural necessity not the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. <q>And there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs,</q> of their own will, that is, not of necessity. <q>And there are eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men....</q>  And, therefore, great is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of continence in them, because it is the will, not incapacity, which makes a man continent. For it is seemly to preserve the gift of divine working whole. And let them not think it too little not to be impeded by the inclination of the body, for if the reward for going through that conflict is taken from their reach, the matter of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is also removed, and though they cannot receive the crown, no more can they be overcome. They have other kinds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> by which they ought to commend themselves if their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be firm, their mercifulness abundant, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> far from them, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> abundant. But in them there is no fault, for they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>76. The case is not the same of those who mutilate themselves, and I touch upon this point advisedly, for there are some who look upon it as a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> deed to check by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of this sort. And though I am not willing to express my own opinion concerning them, though decisions of our forefathers are in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; but then consider whether this tends not rather to a declaration of weakness than to a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for strength. On this principle no one should fight lest he be overcome, nor make use of his feet, fearing the danger of stumbling, nor let his eyes do their office because he fears a fall through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. But what does it profit to cut the flesh, when there may be guilt even in a look? <q>For whosoever looks on a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> already with her in his heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343389"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> And likewise she who looks on a man to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after him commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. It becomes us, then, to be chaste, not weak, to have our eyes modest, not feeble.</p>

<p>77. No one, then, ought, as many suppose, to mutilate himself, but rather gain the victory; for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gathers in those who conquer, not those who are defeated. And why should I use arguments when the words of the Apostle's command are at hand? For you find it thus written: <q>I would that they were mutilated who desire that you should be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>.</q>  For why should the means of gaining a crown and of the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> be lost to a man who is born to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, equipped for victory? How can he through <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> mutilate himself? <q>There be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven's</a> sake.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343391"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;19:12</a></span> </p>

<p>78. This, however, is not a commandment given to all, but a wish set before all. For he who commands must always keep to the exact scope of the commandments, and he who distributes tasks must observe equity in looking into them, for: <q>A false balance is abomination to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343392"><a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;11:1</a></span> There is, then, an excess and a defect in weight, but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> accepts neither, for: <q>Excessive and defective weights and various measures, both of them are alike abominable in the sight of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343393"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse10">Proverbs&nbsp;20:10</a></span> There are tasks which wisdom apportions, and apportions according to the estimate of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and strength of each. <q>He that is able to receive it let him receive it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343394"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;19:12</a></span> </p>

<p>79. For the Creator of all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the dispositions of each are different, and therefore incited <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by rewards, instead of binding weakness by chains. And he, the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the good guide of our conduct, and instructor of our inmost affections, who had learned in himself that the law of the flesh resists the law of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but yields to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, I say, that various movements of the mind are opposed to each other; and, therefore, so expresses his exhortations to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, as not to do away with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of marriage, nor has he so exalted marriage as to check the desire of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. But beginning with the recommendation of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, he goes on to remedies against incontinence, and having set before the stronger the prize of their high calling, he suffers no one to faint by the way; approving those who take the lead so as not to make little of those who follow. For he, himself, had learned that the Lord Jesus gave to some barley bread <span class="stiki" id="note343395"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;6:9</a></span> lest they should faint by the way, and administered His Body to others, <span class="stiki" id="note343396"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;26:26</a></span> that they might strive for the kingdom.</p>

<p>80. For the Lord Himself did not impose this commandment, but invited the will, and the Apostle did not lay down a rule, but gave a counsel. <span class="stiki" id="note343397"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> But this not a man's counsel as to things within the compass of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> strength, for he acknowledges that the gift of divine mercy was bestowed upon him, that he might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how faithfully to set first the former, and to arrange the latter. And, therefore, he says: <q>I think,</q> not, I order, but, <q>I think that this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> because of the present distress.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343398"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:26</a></span> </p>

<p>81. The marriage bond is not then to be shunned as though it were sinful, but rather declined as being a galling burden. For the law binds the wife to bear children in labour and in sorrow, and is in subjection to her husband, for that he is lord over her. So, then, the married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but not the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, is subject to labour and pain in bringing forth children, and she only that is married, not she that is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, is under the power of her husband. The virgin is free from all these things, who has vowed her affection to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who awaits the Spouse of blessing with her lamp burning with the light of a good will. And so she is moved by counsels, not bound by chains.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>Though a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> may have received no commandment, yet she has received so many counsels that she ought not to think little of them. St. Ambrose would be sorry to lay any snare for her, seeing that the field of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> grows richer as a result of wedlock, but it is absolutely impossible to deny that widowhood, which St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> praises, is profitable. Consequently, he speaks severely about those who have proscribed widowhood by law.</p>

<p>82. But neither has the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> received any command, but a counsel; a counsel, however, not given once only but often repeated. For, first, it is said: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man not to touch a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343399"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:1</a></span> And again: <q>I would that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were even as I myself;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343400"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:7</a></span> and once more: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for them if they remain even as I;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343401"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:8</a></span> and a fourth time: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the present distress.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343402"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:26</a></span> And that it is well pleasing to the Lord, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, and, lastly, that perseverance in widowhood is happier, he lays down not only as his own judgment, but also as an aspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Who, then, can reject the kindness of such a counsellor? Who gives the reins to the will, and advises in the case of others that which he has found advantageous by his own experience, he who is not easy to catch up, and is not hurt at being equalled. Who, then, would shrink from becoming <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in body and spirit, since the reward is far above the toil, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> beyond need, and the wages above the work?</p>

<p>83. And this, I say, not in order to lay a snare for others, but that as a good husbandman of the land entrusted to me, I may see this field of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be fruitful, at one time blossoming with the flowers of purity, at another time strong in the gravity of widowhood, and yet again abounding with the fruits of wedlock. For though they be diverse, yet they are the fruits of one field; there are not so many lilies in the gardens as ears of grain in the fields, and many more fields are prepared for receiving seed than lie fallow after the crops are gathered in.</p>

<p>84. Widowhood is, then, good, which is so often praised by the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, for it is a teacher of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and a teacher of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Whereas they who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the adulteries and the shame of their gods appointed penalties for celibacy and widowhood;  that <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in pursuit of crimes they might punish the study of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; under the pretext, indeed, of seeking increase of the population, but in reality that they might put an end to the purpose of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. For the soldier, when his time is ended, lays aside his arms, and leaving the rank which he held, is dismissed as a veteran to his own land, that he may obtain rest after the toils of a laborious life, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> others to be more ready to undergo labour in the hope of future repose. The labourer, too, as he grows too old, entrusts the guiding of the plough to others, and worn out by the toil of his youth, enjoys in his old age that which his foresight has cared for, still ready to prune the vine rather than to press the grapes, so as to check the luxuriance of early life, and to cut off with his pruning knife the wantonness of youth, teaching, as it were, that blessed fruitfulness is to be aimed at even in the vine.</p>

<p>85. In like manner the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, as a veteran, having served her time, though she lays aside the arms of married life, yet orders the peace of the whole house: though now freed from carrying burdens, she is yet watchful for the younger who are to be married; and with the thoughtfulness of old age she arranges where more pains would be profitable, where produce would be more abundant, which is fitted for the marriage bond. And so, if the field is entrusted to the elder rather than to the younger, why should you think that it is more advantageous to be a married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> than a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>? But, if the persecutors of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> have also been the persecutors of widowhood, most certainly by those who hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, widowhood is not to be shunned as a penalty, but to be esteemed as a reward.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>St. Ambrose meets the objection of those who make the desire of having children an excuse for second marriage, and especially in the case of those who have children of their former marriage; and points out the consequent troubles of disagreements among the children, and even between the married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and gives a warning against a wrong use of Scripture instances in this matter.</p>

<p>86. Perhaps, however, it may seem good to some that marriage should again be entered upon for the sake of having children. But if the desire of children be a reason for marrying, certainly where there are children, the reason does not exist. And is it wise to wish to have a second trial of that fruitfulness which has already been tried in vain, or to submit to the solitude which you have already borne? This is the case of those who have no children.</p>

<p>87. Then, too, she who has borne children, and has lost them (for she who has a hope of bearing children will have an intenser longing), does not she, I say, seem to herself to be covering over the deaths of her lost children by the celebration of a second marriage? Will she not again suffer what she is again seeking? And does she not shrink at the graves of her hopes, the memories of the bereavements she has suffered, the voices of the mourners? Or, when the torches are lit and night is coming on, does she not think rather that funeral <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> are being prepared than a bridal chamber? Why, then, my daughter, do you seek again those sorrows which you dread, more than you look for children whom you no longer hope for? If sorrow is so grievous, one should rather avoid than seek that which causes it.</p>

<p>88. And what advice shall I give to you who have children? What reason have you for marrying? Perhaps foolish light-mindedness, or the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of incontinence, or the consciousness of a wounded spirit is urging you on. But counsel is given to the sober, not to the drunken, and so my words are addressed to the free <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> which is whole in each respect. She that is wounded has a remedy, she that is upright a counsel. What do you intend to do then, my daughter? Why do you seek for heirs from without when you have your own? You are not desiring of children, for you have them, but servitude from which you are free. For this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> servitude, in which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is exhausted, which no longer the charm of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and early youth, full of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> modesty and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, excites; when offenses are more felt, and rudeness is more suspected, and agreement less common, which is not bound fast by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> deeply rooted by time, or by beauty in its prime of youth. Duty to a husband is burdensome, so that you are afraid to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your children and blush to look at them; and a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of disagreement arises from that which ordinarily causes mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to increase the tender affections of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. You wish to give birth to offspring who will be not the brothers but the adversaries of your children. For what is to bring forth other children other than to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> the children which you have, who are deprived alike of the offices of affection and of the profit of their possessions.</p>

<p>89. The divine law has bound together husband and wife by its authority, and yet mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> remains a difficult matter. For God took a rib from the man, and formed the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> so as to join them one to the other, and said: <q>They shall be one flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343404"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;2:24</a></span> He said this not of a second marriage but of the first, for neither did Eve take a second husband, nor does <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church recognize a second bridegroom. <q>For that is a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> in Christ and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note343405"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse32">Ephesians&nbsp;5:32</a></span> Neither, again, did Isaac <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> another wife besides Rebecca, <span class="stiki" id="note343406"><a href="../bible/gen024.htm#verse67">Genesis&nbsp;24:67</a></span> nor bury his father, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, with any wife but Sarah.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343407"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;25:10</a></span> </p>

<p>90. But in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Rachel  there was rather the figure of a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> than a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> order of marriage. Notwithstanding, in her, also, we have something which we can refer to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the first marriage, since he loved her best whom he had first <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, and deceit did not shut out his intention, nor the intervening marriage destroy his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for his <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>. And so the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patriarch has taught us, how highly we ought to esteem a first marriage, since he himself esteemed his first betrothal so highly. Take care, then, my daughter, lest you be both unable to hold fast the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of marriage, and also increase your own troubles.</p>
