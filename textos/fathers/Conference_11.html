<h1>Conference 11</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT CHAEREMON. ON PERFECTION.

<p>Although many of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are taught by your example can scarcely emulate the greatness of your perfection, with which you shine like great luminaries with marvellous brightness in this world, yet still you, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brothers Honoratus and Eucherius,  are so stirred by the great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of those splendid men from whom we received the first principles of monasticism, that one of you, presiding as he does over a large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the brethren, is hoping that his congregation, which learns a lesson from the daily sight of your saintly life, may be instructed in the precepts of those fathers, while the other has been anxious to make his way to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to be edified by the sight of these in the flesh, that he might leave this province that is frozen as it were with the cold of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, and like some pure turtle dove fly to those lands on which the sun of righteousness looks and to which it approaches nearest, and which abound with the ripe fruits of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. As a matter of course the greatness of my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wrings this from me; viz., that considering the desire of the one and the labour of the other, I should not decline the danger and peril of writing, if only to the one there may be added authority among his children, and from the other may be removed the necessity for so risky a journey. Further since neither the Institutes of the C&oelig;nobia which we wrote to the best of our ability in twelve books for Bishop Castor of blessed memory, nor the ten Conferences of the fathers living in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Scete, which we composed somehow or other at the bidding of Saints Helladius and Leontius the Bishops,  were able to satisfy your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, now in order that the reason for our journey may be also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, I have thought that seven Conferences of the three fathers whom we first saw living in another desert, might be written in the same style and dedicated to you, in which whatever has been in our previous works perhaps obscurely explained or even omitted on the subject of perfection, may be supplied. But if even this is not enough to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thirst of your desires, seven other Conferences, which are to be sent to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren living in the islands of the St&oelig;chades,  will, I fancy, satisfy your wants and your ardour.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>Description of the town of Thennesus.</strong></p>

<p>When we were living in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> after our first infancy in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and when after we had grown somewhat we had begun to long for some greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of perfection, we determined straightway to seek <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and penetrating even to the remotest desert of the Thebaid,  to visit very many of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and fame had spread abroad everywhere, with the wish if not to emulate them at any rate to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them. And so we came by a very lengthy voyage to a town of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> named Thennesus,  whose inhabitants are so surrounded either by the sea or by <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> lakes that they devote themselves to business alone and get their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and substance by naval commerce as the land fails them, so that indeed when they want to build houses, there is no soil sufficient for this, unless it is brought by boat from a distance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>Of Bishop Archebius.</strong></p>

<p>And when we arrived there, God gratified our wishes, and had brought about the arrival of that most blessed and excellent man Bishop Archebius,  who had been carried off from the assembly of <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> and given as Bishop to the town of Panephysis,  and who kept all his life long to his purpose of solitude with such strictness that he relaxed nothing of the character of his former humility, nor flattered himself on the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> that had been added to him (for he vowed that he had not been summoned to that office as fit for it, but complained that he had been expelled from the monastic system as unworthy of it because though he had spent thirty-seven years in it he had never been able to arrive at the purity so high a profession demands); he then when he had received us kindly and most graciously in the aforesaid Thennesus whither the business of electing a Bishop there had brought him, as soon as he heard of our wish and desire to inquire of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers even in still more remote parts of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: <q>Come,</q> said he, <q>see in the meanwhile the old men who live not far from our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, the length of whose service is shown by their bent bodies, as their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> shines forth in their appearance, so that even the mere sight of them will give a great lesson to those who see them: and from them you can learn not so much by their words as by the actual example of their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, what I grieve that I have lost, and having lost cannot give to you. But I think that my poverty will be somewhat lessened by this <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of mine, if when you are seeking that pearl of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which I have not, I at least provide where you can conveniently procure it.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>Description of the desert where Ch&aelig;remon, Nesteros, and Joseph lived.</strong></p>

<p>And so he took his staff and scrip, as is there the custom for all <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> starting on a journey, and himself led us as guide of our road to his own city, i.e., Panephysis, the lands of which and indeed the greater part of the neighbouring region (formerly an extremely rich one since from it, as report says, everything was supplied for the royal table), had been covered by the sea which was disturbed by a sudden earthquake and overflowed its banks, and so (almost all the villages being in ruins) covered what were formerly rich lands with <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> marshes, so that you might think that what is spiritually sung in the psalm was a literal <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of that region. <q>He has turned rivers into a wilderness; and the springs of waters into a thirsty land: a fruitful land into saltness for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of them that dwell therein.</q>  In these districts then many towns perched in this way on the higher hills were deserted by their inhabitants and turned by the inundation into islands, and these afforded the desired solitude to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a>, among whom three old men; viz., Ch&aelig;remon, Nesteros and Joseph, stood out as <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> of the longest standing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>Of Abbot Ch&aelig;remon and his excuse about the teaching which we asked for.</strong></p>

<p>And so the blessed Archebius thought it best to take us first to Ch&aelig;remon,  because he was nearer to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and because he was more advanced than the other two in age: for he had passed the hundredth year of his life, vigorous only in spirit, but with his back bowed with age and constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, so that, as if he were once more in his childhood he crawled with his hands hanging down and resting on the ground. Gazing then at one and the same time on this man's wonderful face and on his walk (for though all his limbs had already failed and were dead yet he had lost none of the severity of his previous strictness) when we humbly asked for the word and doctrine, and declared that longing for spiritual instruction was the only reason for our coming, he sighed deeply and said: What doctrine can I teach you, I in whom the feebleness of age has relaxed my former strictness, as it has also destroyed my confidence in speaking? For how could I presume to teach what I do not do, or instruct another in what I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I now practise but feebly and coldly? Wherefore I do not allow any of the younger men to live with me now that I am of such an advanced age, lest the other's strictness should be relaxed owing to my example. For the authority of a teacher will never be strong unless he fixes it in the heart of his hearer by the actual performance of his duty.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>Of our answer to his excuse.</strong></p>

<p>At this we were overwhelmed with no slight confusion and replied as follows: Although both the difficulty of the place and the solitary life itself, which even a robust youth could scarcely put up with, ought to be sufficient to teach us everything (and indeed without your saying anything they <em>do</em> teach and impress us a very great deal) yet still we ask you to lay aside your silence for a little and in a more worthy manner implant in us those principles by which we may be able to embrace, not so much by imitating it as by admiring it, that goodness which we see in you. For even if our coldness is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you, and does not deserve to obtain what we are asking for, yet at least the trouble of so long a journey ought to be repaid by it, as we made haste to come here after our first beginning in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, owing to a longing for your instruction, and a yearning for our own good.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>Abbot Ch&aelig;remon's statement that faults can be overcome in three ways.</strong></p>

<p>Then the blessed Ch&aelig;remon: There are, said he, three things which enable men to control their faults; viz., either the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> or of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> even now imposed; or the hope and desire of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; or a liking for goodness itself and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For then we read that the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> loathes contamination: <q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351691"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse13">Proverbs&nbsp;8:13</a></span> Hope also shuts out the assaults of all faults: for <q>all who <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> in Him shall not fail.</q>  Love also fears no destruction from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> never fails;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351693"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:8</a></span> and again: <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> covers a multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351694"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:8</a></span> And therefore the blessed Apostle confines the whole sum of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the attainment of those three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, saying <q>Now abides <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, these three.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351695"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:13</a></span> For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is what makes us shun the stains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of future judgment and punishment; hope is what withdraws our mind from present things, and despises all bodily pleasures from its expectation of heavenly rewards; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is what inflames us with keenness of heart for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ and the fruit of spiritual goodness, and makes us <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> with a perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> whatever is opposed to these. And these three things although they all seem to aim at one and the same end (for they incite us to abstain from things unlawful) yet they differ from each other greatly in the degrees of their excellence. For the two former belong properly to those men who in their aim at goodness have not yet acquired the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and the third belongs specially to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to those who have received into themselves the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For He alone does the things that are good, with no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and no thanks or reward to stir Him up, but simply from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of goodness. For, as Solomon says, <q>The Lord has made all things for Himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351696"><a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse4">Proverbs&nbsp;16:4</a></span> For under cover of His own goodness He bestows all the fullness of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things on the worthy and the unworthy because He cannot be wearied by wrongs, nor be moved by <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as He ever remains perfect goodness and unchangeable in His nature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>By what steps we can ascend to the heights of love and what permanence there is in it.</strong></p>

<p>If then any one is aiming at perfection, from that first stage of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which we rightly termed servile (of which it is said: <q>When you have done all things say: we are unprofitable servants,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351697"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;17:10</a></span>) he should by advancing a step mount to the higher path of hope&mdash; which is compared not to a slave but to a hireling, because it looks for the payment of its recompense, and as if it were free from care concerning absolution of its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment, and conscious of its own good works, though it seems to look for the promised reward, yet it cannot attain to that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of a son who, trusting in his father's kindness and liberality, has no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that all that the father has is his, to which also that prodigal who together with his father's substance had lost the very name of son, did not venture to aspire, when he said: <q>I am no more worthy to be called your son;</q> for after those husks which the swine ate, satisfaction from which was denied to him, i.e., the disgusting food of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as he <q>came to himself,</q> and was overcome by a salutary <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, he already began to loathe the uncleanness of the swine, and to dread the punishment of gnawing hunger, and as if he had already been made a servant, desires the condition of a hireling and thinks about the remuneration, and says: <q>How many hired servants of my father have abundance of bread, and I perish here with hunger. I will then return to my father and will say unto him, 'Father I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against heaven and before you, and am no more worthy to be called your son: make me as one of your hired servants.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351698"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse17">Luke&nbsp;15:17-19</a></span> But those words of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> penitence his father who ran to meet him received with greater affection than that with which they were spoken, and was not content to allow him lesser things, but passing through the two stages without delay restored him to his former dignity of sonship. We also ought immediately to hasten on that by means of the indissoluble <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we may mount to that third stage of sonship, which believes that all that the father has is its own, and so we may be counted worthy to receive the image and likeness of our heavenly Father, and be able to say after the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> son: <q>All that the Father has is mine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351699"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;16:15</a></span> Which also the blessed Apostle declares of us, saying: <q>All things are yours, whether <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> or Apollos or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351700"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:22</a></span> And to this likeness the commands of our Saviour also summon us: <q>Be,</q> says He, <q>perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351701"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse48">Matthew&nbsp;5:48</a></span> For in these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> sometimes the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of goodness is found to be interrupted, when the vigour of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is relaxed by some coldness or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or delight, and so loses either the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> for the time, or the desire of future blessings. And there is indeed in these a stage leading to some advance, which affects us so that when from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment or from hope of reward we begin to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we are enabled to pass on to the stage of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for <q><a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>,</q> says one, <q>is not in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> casts out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> has torment, but he who fears is not perfect in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. We therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> because God first loved us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351702"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18-19</a></span> We can then only ascend to that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> perfection when, as He first loved us for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of nothing but our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, we also have loved Him for the sake of nothing but His own <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> alone. Wherefore we must do our best to mount with perfect ardour of mind from this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to hope, from hope to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> themselves, that as we steadily pass on to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of goodness itself, we may, as far as it is possible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, keep firm hold of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>How greatly those excel who depart from sin through the feeling of love.</strong></p>

<p>For there is a great difference between one who puts out the fire of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> within him by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> or hope of future reward, and one who from the feeling of divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has a horror of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself and of uncleanness, and keeps hold of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of purity simply from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and longing for purity, and looks for no reward from a promise for the future, but, delighted with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things present, does everything not from regard to punishment but from delight in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For this condition can neither abuse an opportunity to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> witnesses are absent, nor be corrupted by the secret allurements of thoughts, while, keeping in its very marrow the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself, it not only does not admit into the heart anything that is opposed to it, but actually <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> it with the utmost horror. For it is one thing for a man in his delight at some present good to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the stains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and of the flesh, and another thing to check unlawful desires by contemplating the future reward; and it is one thing to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> present loss and another to dread future punishment. Lastly it is a much greater thing to be unwilling to forsake good for good's own sake, than it is to withhold consent from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For in the former case the good is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, but in the latter it is constrained and as it were violently forced out of a reluctant party either by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment or by greed of reward. For one who abstains from the allurements of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> owing to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, will whenever the obstacle of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is removed, once more return to what he loves and thus will not continually acquire any stability in good, nor will he ever rest free from attacks because he will not secure the sure and lasting peace of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. For where there is the disturbance of warfare there cannot help being the danger of wounds. For one who is in the midst of the conflict, even though he is a warrior and by fighting bravely inflicts frequent and deadly wounds on his foes, must still sometimes be pierced by the point of the enemy's sword. But one who has defeated the attack of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and is now in the enjoyment of the security of peace, and has passed on to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself, will keep this condition of good continually, as he is entirely wrapped up in it, because he believes that nothing can be worse than the loss of his inmost <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. For he deems nothing dearer or more precious than present purity, to whom a dangerous departure from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or a poisonous stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a grievous punishment. To such an one, I say, neither will regard for the presence of another add anything to his goodness nor will solitude take anything away from it: but as always and everywhere he bears about with him his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> as a judge not only of his actions but also of his thoughts, he will especially try to please it, as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it cannot be cheated nor deceived, and that he cannot escape it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>How it is the perfection of love to pray for one's enemies and by what signs we may recognize a mind that is not yet purified.</strong></p>

<p>When then any one has acquired this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of goodness of which we have been speaking, and the imitation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then he will be endowed with the Lord's heart of compassion, and will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> also for his persecutors, saying in like manner: <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351712"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> But it is a clear sign of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is not yet thoroughly purged from the dregs of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not to sorrow with a feeling of pity at the offenses of others, but to keep to the rigid censure of the judge: for how will he be able to obtain perfection of heart, who is without that by which, as the Apostle has pointed out, the full requirements of the law can be fulfilled, saying: <q>Bear one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351713"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse2">Galatians&nbsp;6:2</a></span> and who has not that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which <q>is not grieved, is not puffed up, thinks no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> which <q>endures all things, bears all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351714"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:4-7</a></span> For <q>a righteous man pities the life of his beasts: but the heart of the ungodly is without pity.</q>  And so a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is quite certain to fall into the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he condemns in another with merciless and inhuman severity, for <q>a stern king will fall into misfortunes,</q> and <q>one who stops his ears so as not to hear the weak, shall himself cry, and there shall be none to hear him.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>A question why he has called the feeling of fear and hope imperfect.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: You have indeed spoken powerfully and grandly of the perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But still this fact disturbs us; viz., that while you were exalting it with such praise, you said that the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the hope of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward were imperfect, though the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> seems to have thought quite differently about them, where he said: <q>Fear the Lord, all you His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, for they that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him lack nothing.</q>  And again in the matter of observing God's righteous acts he admits that he has done them from consideration of the reward, saying: <q>I have inclined my heart to do your righteous acts forever, for the reward.</q>  And the Apostle says: <q>By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> when he was grown up, denied himself to be the son of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> daughter; choosing rather to be afflicted with the people of God than to have the pleasure of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for a season, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure of the Egyptians; for he looked unto the reward.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351719"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse24">Hebrews&nbsp;11:24-26</a></span> How then can we think that they are imperfect, if the blessed David boasted that he did the righteous acts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in hope of a recompense, and the giver of the Law is said to have looked for a future reward and so to have despised the adoption to royal dignity, and to have preferred the most terrible affliction to the treasures of the Egyptians?</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>The answer on the different kinds of perfection.</strong></p>

<p>Ch&aelig;remon: In accordance with the condition and measure of every mind <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> summons our free wills to different grades of perfection. For no uniform crown of perfection can be offered to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because all have not the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or purpose, or fervour, and so the Divine Word has in some way appointed different ranks and different measures of perfection itself. And that this is so the variety of beatitudes in the gospel clearly shows. For though they are called blessed, whose is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and blessed are they who shall possess the earth, and blessed are they who shall receive their consolation, and blessed are they who shall be filled, yet we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is a great difference between the habitations of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and the possession of the earth, whatever it be, and also between the reception of consolation and the fullness and satisfaction of righteousness; and that there is a great distinction between those who shall obtain mercy, and those who shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>For there is one <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the sun, and another <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the moon, and another <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the stars: for star differs from star in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, so also is the resurrection of the dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351720"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse41">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:41-42</a></span> While therefore in accordance with this rule <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture praises those who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and says <q>Blessed are all they that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord,</q>  and promises them for this a full measure of bliss, yet it says again: <q>There is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> casts out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> has torment. But he that fears is not yet perfect in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351722"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</a></span> And again, though it is a grand thing to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it is said: <q>Serve the Lord in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>;</q> and: <q>It is a great thing for you to be called My servant;</q> and: <q>Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He comes, shall find so doing,</q>  yet it is said to the Apostles: <q>I no longer call you servants, for the servant <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what his Lord does: but I call you friends, for all things whatsoever I have heard from my Father, I have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351724"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;15:14-15</a></span> And once more: <q>You are My friends, if you do whatever I command you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351725"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;15:13</a></span> You see then that there are different stages of perfection, and that we are called by the Lord from high things to still higher in such a way that he who has become blessed and perfect in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; going as it is written <q>from strength to strength,</q>  and from one perfection to another, i.e., mounting with keenness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to hope, is summoned in the end to that still more blessed stage, which, is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and he who has been <q>a faithful and wise servant</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351727"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;24:45</a></span> will pass to the companionship of friendship and to the adoption of sons. So then our saying also must be understood according to this meaning: not that we say that the consideration of that enduring punishment or of that blessed recompense which is promised to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is of no value, but because, though they are useful and introduce those who pursue them to the first beginning of blessedness, yet again <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, wherein is already fuller confidence, and a lasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, will remove them from servile <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and mercenary hope to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and carry them on to the adoption of sons, and somehow make them from being perfect still more perfect. For the Saviour says that in His Father's house are <q>many mansions,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351728"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;14:2</a></span> and although all the stars seem to be in the sky, yet there is a mighty difference between the brightness of the sun and of the moon, and between that of the morning star and the rest of the stars. And therefore the blessed Apostle prefers it not only above <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and hope but also above all gifts which are counted great and wonderful, and shows the way of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> still more excellent than all. For when after finishing his list of spiritual gifts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> he wanted to describe its members, he began as follows: <q>And yet I show unto you a still more excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and though I have the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and though I have all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> so that I can remove mountains, and though I bestow all my goods to feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and give my body to be burned, but have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, it profits me nothing.</q> You see then that nothing more precious, nothing more perfect, nothing more sublime, and, if I may say so, nothing more enduring can be found than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For <q>whether there be prophecies, they shall fail, whether there be tongues, they shall cease, whether there be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it shall be destroyed,</q> but <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> never fails,</q>  and without it not only those most excellent kinds of gifts, but even the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> itself will fail.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><strong>Of the fear which is the outcome of the greatest love.</strong></p>

<p>Whoever then has been established in this perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is sure to mount by a higher stage to that still more sublime <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> belonging to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which is the outcome of no dread of punishment or greed of reward, but of the greatest <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; whereby a son fears with earnest affection a most indulgent father, or a brother fears his brother, a friend his friend, or a wife her husband, while there is no dread of his blows or reproaches, but only of a slight injury to his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and while in every word as well as act there is ever care taken by anxious affection lest the warmth of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> should cool in the very slightest degree towards the object of it. And one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> has finely described the grandeur of this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, saying: <q>Wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are the riches of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is his treasure.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351730"><a href="../bible/isa033.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;33:6</a></span> He could not describe with greater clearness the worth and value of that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> than by saying that the riches of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which consist in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can only be preserved by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord. To this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> then not sinners but <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are invited by the prophetic word where the Psalmist says: <q>O <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord, all you His Saints: for they that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him lack nothing.</q>  For where a man fears the Lord with this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> it is certain that nothing is lacking to his perfection.

For <q>there is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> casts out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351734"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</a></span> And in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> if the beginning of wisdom consists in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, what will its perfection be except in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ which, as it contains in it the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which belongs to perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, is called not the beginning but the treasure of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? And therefore there is a twofold stage of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. The one for beginners, i.e., for those who are still subject to the yoke and to servile terror; of which we read: <q>And the servant shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> his Lord;</q>  and in the gospel: <q>I no longer call you servants, for the servant <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what his Lord does;</q> and therefore <q>the servant,</q> He tells us, <q>abides not in the house for ever, but the Son abides for ever.</q>  For He is instructing us to pass on from that penal <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to the fullest freedom of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the confidence of the friends and sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Finally the blessed Apostle, who had by the power of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> already passed through the servile stage of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, scorns lower things and declares that he has been enriched with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things by the Lord, <q>for God has not given us</q> he says <q>a spirit of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> but of power and of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and of a sound mind.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351737"><a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:7</a></span> Those also who are inflamed with a perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of their heavenly Father, and whom the Divine adoption has already made sons instead of servants, he addresses in these words: <q>For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but you received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351738"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;8:15</a></span> It is of this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> too, that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> spoke when he would describe that sevenfold spirit, which according to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Incarnation, full surely descended on the God man:  <q>And there shall rest upon Him the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>: the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> godliness,</q> and in the last place he adds as something special these words: <q>And the Spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord shall fill Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351740"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2-3</a></span> Where we must in the first place notice carefully that he does not say <q>and <em>there shall rest upon Him</em> the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>,</q> as he said in the earlier cases, but he says <q> <em>there shall fill Him</em> the Spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord.</q> For such is the greatness of its richness that when once it has seized on a man by its power, it takes possession not of a portion but of his whole mind. And not without good reason. For as it is closely joined to that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which <q>never fails,</q> it not only fills the man, but takes a lasting and inseparable and continual possession of him in whom it has begun, and is not lessened by any allurements of temporal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or delights, as is sometimes the case with that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which is cast out. This then is the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> belonging to perfection, with which we are told that the God-man,  who came not only to redeem <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, but also to give us a pattern of perfection and example of goodness, was filled. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> <q>who did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> neither was guile found in His mouth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351742"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:22</a></span> could not feel that servile <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>A question about complete chastity.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: Now that you have finished your discourse on perfect <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, we want also to ask somewhat more freely about the end of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. For we do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that those lofty heights of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, by which, as you have hitherto explained, we mount to the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot possibly exist without perfect purity. But we should like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether a lasting grant of it can be secured so that no incitement to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> may ever disturb the serenity of our heart, and that thus we may be enabled to pass the time of our sojourneying in the flesh free from this carnal passion, so as never to be inflamed by the fire of excitement.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>The postponement of the explanation which is asked for.</strong></p>

<p>Ch&aelig;remon: It is indeed a sign of the utmost blessedness and of singular goodness both continually to learn and to teach that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by which we cling to the Lord, so that meditation on Him may, as the Psalmist says, occupy all the days and nights of our life,  and may support our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which insatiably hungers and thirsts after righteousness, by continually chewing the cud of this heavenly food. But we must also, in accordance with the kindly forethought of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, make some provision for the food of the body, that we faint not by the way, <span class="stiki" id="note351744"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;15:32</a></span> for <q>the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351745"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;26:41</a></span> And this we must now secure by taking a little food, so that after supper, the mind may be rendered more attentive for the careful tracing out of what you want.</p>
