<h1>Conference 14</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT NESTEROS. ON SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>The words of Abbot Nesteros on the knowledge of the religious.</strong></p>

<p>The order of our promise and course demands that there should follow the instruction of Abbot Nesteros,  a man of excellence in all points and of the greatest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: who when he had seen that we had committed some parts of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> to memory and desired to understand them, addressed us in these words. There are indeed many different kinds of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in this world, since there is as great a variety of them as there is of the arts and sciences. But, while all are either utterly useless or only useful for the good of this present life, there is yet none which has not its own system and method for learning it, by which it can be grasped by those who seek it. If then those arts are guided by certain special rules for their publication, how much more does the system and expression of our religion, which tends to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the secrets of invisible <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and seeks no present gain but the reward of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> recompense, depend on a fixed order and scheme. And the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this is twofold: first, <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F75;</span>, i.e., practical, which is brought about by an improvement of morals and purification from faults: secondly, <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03C1;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F75;</span>, which consists in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of things Divine and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of most sacred thoughts.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>On grasping the knowledge of spiritual things.</strong></p>

<p>Whoever then would arrive at this theoretical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> must first pursue practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with all his might and main. For this practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> can be acquired without theoretical, but theoretical cannot possibly be gained without practical. For there are certain stages, so distinct, and arranged in such a way that man's humility may be able to mount on high; and if these follow each other in turn in the order of which we have spoken, man can attain to a height to which he could not fly, if the first step were wanting. In vain then does one strive for the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who does not shun the stains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: <q>For the spirit of God <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> deception, and dwells not in a body subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351866"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse4">Wisdom&nbsp;1:4-5</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>How practical perfection depends on a double system.</strong></p>

<p>But this practical perfection depends on a double system; for its first method is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of all faults and the manner of their cure. Its second, to discover the order of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and form our mind by their perfection so that it may be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to them, not as if it were forced and subject to some fierce sway, but as if it delighted in its natural good, and throve upon it, and mounted by that steep and narrow way with real pleasure. For in what way will one, who has neither succeeded in understanding the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his own faults, nor tried to eradicate them, be able to gain an understanding of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which is the second stage of practical training, or the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of spiritual and heavenly things, which exist in the higher stage of theoretical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? For it will necessarily be maintained that he cannot advance to more lofty heights who has not surmounted the lower ones, and much less will he be able to grasp those things that are without, who has not succeeded in understanding what is within his comprehension. But you should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we must make an effort with a twofold purpose in our exertion; both for the expulsion of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and for the attainment of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And this we do not gather from our own conjecture, but are taught by the words of Him who alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the strength and method of His work: <q>Behold,</q> He says: <q>I have set you this day over the nations and over kingdoms, to root up, and to pull down, and to waste, and to destroy, and to build and to plant.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351867"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:10</a></span> He points out that for getting rid of noxious things four things are requisite; viz., to root up, to pull down, to waste, and to destroy: but for the performance of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the acquisition of what pertains to righteousness only to build and to plant. Whence it is perfectly evident that it is a harder thing to tear up and eradicate the inveterate <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than to introduce and plant spiritual <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>How practical life is distributed among many different professions and interests.</strong></p>

<p>This practical life then, which as has been said rests on a double system, is distributed among many different professions and interests. For some make it their whole purpose to aim at the secrecy of an <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a> and purity of heart, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in the past Elijah and Elisha, and in our own day the blessed Antony and others who followed with the same object, were joined most closely to God by the silence of solitude. Some have given all their efforts and interests towards the system of the brethren and the watchful care of the C&oelig;nobium; as we remember that recently Abbot John, who presided over a big <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the neighbourhood of the city Thmuis,  and some other men of like merits were eminent with the signs of Apostles. Some are pleased with the kindly service of the guest house and reception, by which in the past the patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> pleased the Lord, and recently the blessed Macarius,  a man of singular courtesy and patience who presided over the guest house at Alexandria in such a way as to be considered inferior to none of those who aimed at the retirement of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. Some choose the care of the sick, others devote themselves to intercession, which is offered up for the oppressed and afflicted, or give themselves up to teaching, or give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and flourish among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of excellence and renown, by reason of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and goodness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>On perseverance in the line that has been chosen.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and profitable for each one to endeavour with all his might and main to attain perfection in the work that has been begun, according to the line which he has chosen as the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which he has received; and while he praises and admires the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of others, not to swerve from his own line which he has once for all chosen, as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that, as the Apostle says, the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> indeed is one, but the members many, and that it has <q>gifts differing according to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is given us, whether <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, according to the proportion of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whether ministry, in ministering, or he that teaches, in doctrine, or he that exhorts in exhortation, he that gives, in simplicity, he that rules, with carefulness, he that shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351870"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;12:4-8</a></span> For no members can claim the offices of other members, because the eyes cannot perform the duties of the hands, nor the nostrils of the ears. And so not all are Apostles, not all <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, not all doctors, not all have the gifts of healing, not all speak with tongues, not all interpret. <span class="stiki" id="note351871"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:28</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>How the weak are easily moved.</strong></p>

<p>For those who are not yet settled in the line which they have taken up are often, when they hear some praised for different interests and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, so excited by the praise of them that they try immediately to imitate their method: and in this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness is sure to expend its efforts to no purpose. For it is an impossibility for one and the same man to excel at once in all those good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which I enumerated above. And if anyone is anxious equally to affect them all, he is quite sure to come to this; viz., that while he pursues them all, he will not thoroughly succeed in any one, and will lose more than he will gain from this changing and shifting about. For in many ways men advance towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so each man should complete that one which he has once fixed upon, never changing the course of his purpose, so that he may be perfect in whatever line of life his may be.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>An instance of chastity which teaches us that all men should not be emulous of all things.</strong></p>

<p>For apart from that loss, which we have said that a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> incurs who wants in light-mindedness to pass from one pursuit to another, there is a risk of death that is hence incurred, because at times things which are rightly done by some are wrongly taken by others as an example, and things which turned out well for some, are found to be injurious to others. For, to give an instance, it is as if one wished to imitate the good deed of that man, which Abbot John is wont to bring forward, not for the sake of imitating him but simply out of admiration for him; for one came to the aforesaid old man in a secular dress and when he had brought him some of the first fruits of his crops, he found some one there possessed by a most fierce <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And this one though he scorned the adjurations and commands of Abbot John, and vowed that he would never at his bidding leave the body which he had occupied, yet was terrified at the coming of this other, and departed with a most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> utterance of his name. And the old man marvelled not a little at his so evident <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and was the more astonished at him because he saw that he had on a secular dress; and so began carefully to ask of him the manner of his life and pursuit. And when he said that he was living in the world and bound by the ties of marriage, the blessed John, considering in his mind the greatness of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, searched out still more carefully what his manner of life might be. He declared that he was a countryman, and that he sought his food by the daily toil of his hands, and was not conscious of anything good about him except that he never went forth to his work in the fields in the morning nor came home in the evening without having returned thanks in Church for the food of his daily life, to God Who gave it; and that he had never used any of his crops without having first offered to God their first fruits and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>; and that he had never driven his oxen over the bounds of another's harvest without having first muzzled them that his neighbour might not sustain the slightest loss through his carelessness. And when these things did not seem to Abbot John sufficient to procure such <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as that with which he saw that he was endowed, and he inquired of him and investigated what it was which could be connected with the merits of such <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he was induced by respect for such anxious inquiries to confess that, when he wanted to be professed as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, he had been compelled by force and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> command, twelve years before to take a wife, who, without any body to that day being aware of it, was kept by him as a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in the place of a sister. And when the old man heard this, he was so overcome with admiration that he announced publicly in his presence that it was not without good reason that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who had scorned him himself, could not endure the presence of this man, whose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> he himself, not only in the ardour of youth, but even now, would not dare to aim at without risk of his <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. And though Abbot John would tell this story with the utmost admiration, yet he never advised any <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> to try this plan as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that many things which are rightly done by some involved others who imitate them in great danger, and that that cannot be tried by all, which the Lord bestowed upon a few by a special gift.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>Of spiritual knowledge.</strong></p>

<p>But to return to the explanation of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from which our discourse took its rise. Thus, as we said above, <em>practical</em> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is distributed among many subjects and interests, but <em>theoretical</em> is divided into two parts, i.e., the historical interpretation and the spiritual sense. Whence also Solomon when he had summed up the manifold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, added: &nbsp;<q>for all who are with her are clothed with double garments.</q>  But of spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> there are three kinds, tropological, allegorical, anagogical,  of which we read as follows in Proverbs: <q>But do you describe these things to yourself in three ways according to the largeness of your heart.</q>  And so the history embraces the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things past and visible, as it is repeated in this way by the Apostle: <q>For it is written that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had two sons, the one by a bondwoman, the other by a free: but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but he who was of the free was by promise.</q> But to the allegory belongs what follows, for what actually happened is said to have prefigured the form of some <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>: <q>For these,</q> says he, <q>are the two covenants, the one from Mount Sinai, which genders into bondage, which is Agar. &nbsp;For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia, which is compared to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</q> But the anagogical sense rises from spiritual <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> even to still more sublime and sacred secrets of heaven, and is subjoined by the Apostle in these words: <q>But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us. For it is written, Rejoice, you barren that bearest not, break forth and cry, you that travailest not, for many are the children of the desolate more than of her that has an husband.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351875"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;4:22-27</a></span> The tropological sense is the moral explanation which has to do with improvement of life and practical teaching, as if we were to understand by these two covenants practical and theoretical instruction, or at any rate as if we were to want to take Jerusalem or Sion as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to this: <q>Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, O Sion.</q>  And so these four previously mentioned figures coalesce, if we desire, in one subject, so that one and the same Jerusalem can be taken in four senses: historically as the city of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; allegorically as Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, anagogically as the heavenly city of God <q>which is the mother of us all,</q> tropologically, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which is frequently subject to praise or blame from the Lord under this title. Of these four kinds of interpretation the blessed Apostle speaks as follows: <q>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation or by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> or by doctrine?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351877"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:6</a></span> For <q>revelation</q> belongs to allegory whereby what is concealed under the historical narrative is revealed in its spiritual sense and interpretation, as for instance if we tried to expound how <q>all our fathers were under the cloud and were all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the cloud and in the sea,</q> and how they <q>all ate the same spiritual meat and drank the same spiritual drink from the rock that followed them. But the rock was Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351878"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:1-4</a></span> And this explanation where there is a comparison of the figure of the body and blood of Christ which we receive daily, contains the allegorical sense. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is in the same way mentioned by the Apostle, is tropological, as by it we can by a careful study see of all things that have to do with practical discernment whether they are useful and good, as in this case, when we are told to judge of our own selves <q>whether it is fitting for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to God with her head uncovered.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351879"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:13</a></span> And this system, as has been said, contains the moral meaning. So <q><a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a></q> which the Apostle puts in the third place, alludes to the anagogical sense by which the words are applied to things future and invisible, as here: <q>But we would not have you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, brethren, concerning those that sleep: that you be not sorry as others also who have no hope. For if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Christ died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him. For this we say to you by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we which are alive at the coming of the Lord shall not prevent those that sleep in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the dead in Christ shall rise first.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351880"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:12-15</a></span> In which kind of exhortation the figure of anagoge is brought forward. But <q>doctrine</q> unfolds the simple course of historical exposition, under which is contained no more secret sense, but what is declared by the very words: as in this passage: <q>For I delivered unto you first of all what I also received, how that Christ died for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and that He was buried, and that He rose again on the third day, and that he was seen of Cephas;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351881"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:3-5</a></span> and: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351882"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4-5</a></span> or this: <q>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord the God is one Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351883"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:4</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>How from practical knowledge we must proceed to spiritual.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore if you are anxious to attain to the light of spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not wrongly for an idle boast but for the sake of being made better men, you are first inflamed with the longing for that blessedness, of which we read: <q>blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351884"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> that you may also attain to that of which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to Daniel: <q>But they that are learned shall shine as the splendor of the firmament: and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever;</q> and in another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Enlighten yourselves with the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> while there is time.</q>  And so keeping up that diligence in reading, which I see that you have, endeavour with all eagerness to gain in the first place a thorough grasp of practical, i.e., ethical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For without this that theoretical purity of which we have spoken cannot be obtained, which those only, who are perfected not by the words of others who teach them, but by the excellence of their own actions, can after much expenditure of effort and toil attain as a reward for it. For as they gain their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> not from meditation on the law but from the fruit of their labour, they sing with the Psalmist: <q>From Your commandments I have understanding;</q> and having overcome all their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, they say with confidence: <q>I will sing, and I will understand in the undefiled way.</q>  For he who is striving in an undefiled way in the course of a pure heart, as he sings the Psalm, understands the words which are chanted. And therefore if you would prepare in your heart a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> tabernacle of spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, purge yourselves from the stain of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and rid yourselves of the cares of this world. For it is an impossibility for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is taken up even to a small extent with worldly troubles, to gain the gift of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or to become an author of spiritual interpretation, and diligent in reading <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things. Be careful therefore in the first place, and especially you, John, as your more youthful age requires you the rather to be careful about what I am going to say&mdash; that you may enjoin absolute silence on your lips, in order that your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for reading and the efforts of your purpose may not be destroyed by vain <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For this is the first practical step towards learning, to receive the regulations and opinions of all the Elders with an earnest heart, and with lips that are dumb; and diligently to lay them up in your heart, and endeavour rather to perform than to teach them. For from teaching, the dangerous arrogance of vainglory, but from performing, the fruit of spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> will flourish. And so you should never venture to say anything in the conference of the Elders unless some <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that might be injurious, or a matter which it is important to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> leads you to ask a question; as some who are puffed up with vainglory, pretend that they ask, in order really to show off the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which they perfectly possess. For it is an impossibility for one, who takes to the pursuit of reading with the purpose of gaining the praise of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to be rewarded with the gift of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For one who is bound by the chain of this passion, is sure to be also in bondage to other faults, and especially to that of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>: and so if he is baffled by his encounter with practical and ethical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he will certainly not attain that spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which springs from it. Be then in all things <q>swift to hear, but slow to speak,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351887"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse19">James&nbsp;1:19</a></span> lest there come upon you that which is noted by Solomon: <q>If you see a man who is quick to speak, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is more hope of a fool than of him;</q>  and do not presume to teach any one in words what you have not already performed in deed. For our Lord taught us by His own example that we ought to keep to this order, as of Him it is said: <q>what Jesus began to do and to teach.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351889"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Take care then that you do not rush into teaching before doing, and so be reckoned among the number of those of whom the Lord speaks in the gospel to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>What they say unto you, that observe and do, but not after their words: for they say and do not. But they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351890"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;23:3-4</a></span> For if he who shall <q>break one of these commands, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351891"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;5:19</a></span> it follows that one who has dared to despise many and greater commands and to teach men so, shall certainly be considered not least in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, but greatest in the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. And therefore you must be careful not to be led on to teach by the example of those who have attained some skill in discussion and readiness in speech and because they can discourse on what they please elegantly and fully, are imagined to possess spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by those who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to distinguish its real force and character. For it is one thing to have a ready tongue and elegant language, and quite another to penetrate into the very heart and marrow of heavenly utterances and to gaze with pure eye of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on profound and hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; for this can be gained by no learning of man's, nor condition of this world, only by purity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by means of the illumination of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>How to embrace the system of true knowledge.</strong></p>

<p>You must then, if you want to get at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, endeavour first to secure steadfast humility of heart, to carry you on by the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which puffs up, but to that which enlightens. For it is an impossibility for an impure mind to gain the gift of spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And therefore with every possible care avoid this, lest through your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for reading there arise in you not the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> nor the lasting <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is promised through the light that comes from learning but only the instruments of your destruction from vain arrogance. Next you must by all means strive to get rid of all anxiety and worldly thoughts, and give yourself over assiduously or rather continuously, to sacred reading, until continual meditation fills your heart, and fashions you so to speak after its own likeness, making of it, in a way, an ark of the testimony, <span class="stiki" id="note351892"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;9:4-5</a></span> which has within it two tables of stone, i.e., the constant assurance of the two testaments;  and a golden pot, i.e., a pure and undefiled memory which preserves by a constant tenacity the manna stored up in it, i.e., the enduring and heavenly sweetness of the spiritual sense and the bread of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; moreover also the rod of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, i.e., the saving standard of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> High Priest, that ever buds with the freshness of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> memory. For this is the rod which after it had been cut from the root of Jesse, died and flourished again with a more vigorous life. But all these are guarded by two Cherubim, i.e., the fullness of historical and spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For the Cherubim mean a multitude of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: and these continually protect the mercy seat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e., the peace of your heart, and overshadow it from all the assaults of spiritual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And so your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be carried forward not only to the ark of the Divine Covenant, but also to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> kingdom, and owing to its unbroken <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of purity being as it were engrossed in spiritual studies, will fulfil the command given to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, enjoined as follows by the giver of the Law: <q>And he shall not go forth from the sanctuary, lest he pollute the Sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351894"><a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse12">Leviticus&nbsp;21:12</a></span> i.e., his heart, in which the Lord promised that he would ever dwell, saying: <q>I will dwell in them and will walk among them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351895"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:16</a></span> Wherefore the whole series of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> should be diligently committed to memory and ceaselessly repeated. For this continual meditation will bring us a twofold fruit: first, that while the attention of the mind is taken up in reading and preparing the lessons it cannot possibly be taken captive in any snares of bad thoughts: next that those things which were conned over and frequently repeated and which while we were trying to commit them to memory we could not understand as the mind was at that time taken up, we can afterward see more clearly, when we are free from the distraction of all acts and visions, and especially when we reflect on them in silence in our meditation by night. So that when we are at rest, and as it were plunged in the stupor of sleep, there is revealed to us the understanding of the most secret meanings, of which in our waking hours we had not the remotest conception.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>Of the manifold meaning of the Holy Scriptures.</strong></p>

<p>But as the renewal of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> grows by means of this study, Scripture also will begin to put on a new face, and the beauty of the holier meanings will somehow grow with our growth. For their form is adapted to the capacity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> understanding, and will appear earthly to carnal people, and divine to spiritual ones, so that those to whom it formerly appeared to be involved in thick clouds, cannot apprehend its subtleties nor endure its light. But to make this which we are aiming at somewhat clearer by an instance, it will be enough to produce a single passage of the law, by which we can prove that all the heavenly commands as well are applied to men in accordance with the measure of our state. For it is written in the law: <q>You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351896"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;20:14</a></span> This is rightly observed according to the simple meaning of the letter, by a man who is still in bondage to foul <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But by one who has already forsaken these dirty acts and impure affections, it must be observed in the spirit, so that he may forsake not only the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> but also all <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> and the observance of auguries and omens and all signs and days and times, or at any rate that he be not entangled in the conjectures of words and names which destroy the simplicity of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For by fornication of this kind we read that Jerusalem was defiled, as she committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> <q>on every high hill and under every green tree,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351897"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse6">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:6</a></span> whom also the Lord rebuked by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying: <q>Let now the astrologers stand and save you, they that gazed at the stars and counted the months, that from them they might tell the things that shall come to you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351898"><a href="../bible/isa047.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;47:13</a></span> of which fornication elsewhere also the Lord says in rebuking them: <q>The spirit of fornication deceived them, and they went a whoring from their God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351899"><a href="../bible/hos004.htm#verse12">Hosea&nbsp;4:12</a></span> But one who has forsaken both these kinds of fornication, will have a third kind to avoid, which is contained in the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> of the law and of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>; of which the Apostle says: <q>You observe days and months and times and years;</q> and again: Touch not, taste not, handle not.  And there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this is said of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> of the law, into which one who has fallen has certainly gone a whoring from Christ, and is not worthy to hear this from the Apostle: <q>For I have espoused you to one husband, to exhibit you as a chaste virgin to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351901"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:2</a></span> But this that follows will be directed to him by the words of the same Apostle: <q>But I am afraid lest as the serpent by his cunning deceived Eve, so your minds should be corrupted and fall from the simplicity which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q>  But if one has escaped the uncleanness even of this fornication there will still be a fourth, which is committed by adulterous intercourse with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching. Of which too the blessed Apostle speaks: <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that after my departure grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock, and of yourselves also shall arise men speaking perverse things so as to lead astray the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351903"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse29">Acts&nbsp;20:29-30</a></span> But if a man has succeeded in avoiding even this, let him beware lest he fall by a more subtle <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> into the guilt of fornication. I mean that which consists in wandering thoughts, because every thought which is not only shameful but even idle, and departing in however small a degree from God is regarded by the perfect man as the foulest fornication.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>A question how we can attain to forgetfulness of the cares of this world.</strong></p>

<p>Upon this I was at first moved by a secret emotion, and then groaned deeply and said, All these things which you have set forth so fully have affected me with still greater despair than that which I had previously endured: as besides those general captivities of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> whereby I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that weak people are smitten from without, a special hindrance to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is added by that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of literature which I seem already to have in some slight measure attained, in which the efforts of my tutor, or my attention to continual reading have so weakened me that now my mind is filled with those songs of the poets so that even at the hour of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> it is thinking about those trifling fables, and the stories of battles with which from its earliest infancy it was stored by its childish lessons: and when singing Psalms or asking forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> either some wanton recollection of the poems intrudes itself or the images of heroes fighting presents itself before the eyes, and an imagination of such phantoms is always tricking me and does not suffer my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to aspire to an insight into things above, so that this cannot be got rid of by my daily lamentations.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><strong>Of the method by which we can remove the dross from our memory.</strong></p>

<p>Nesteros: From this very fact, from which there springs up for you the utmost despair of your purification, a speedy and effectual remedy may arise if only you will transfer to the reading of and meditation upon the writings of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the same diligence and earnestness which you say that you showed in those secular studies of yours. For your mind is sure to be taken up with those poems until it is gaining with the same <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and assiduity other matters for it to reflect upon, and is in labour with spiritual and divine things instead of unprofitable earthly ones. But when these are thoroughly and entirely conceived and it has been nourished upon them, then by degrees the former thoughts can be expelled and utterly got rid of. For the mind of man cannot be emptied of all thoughts, and so as long as it is not taken up with spiritual interests, is sure to be occupied with what it learned long since. For as long as it has nothing to recur to and exercise itself upon unweariedly, it is sure to fall back upon what it learned in childhood, and ever to think about what it took in by long use and meditation. In order then that this spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may be strengthened in you with a lasting steadfastness, and that you may not enjoy it only for a time like those who just touch it not by their own exertions but at the recital of another, and if I may use the expression, perceive its scent in the air; but that it may be laid up in your heart, and deeply noted in it, and thoroughly seen and handled, it is well for you to use the utmost care in securing that, even if perhaps you hear things that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> very well produced in the Conference, you do not regard them in a scornful and disdainful way because you already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, but that you lay them to your heart with the same eagerness, with which the words of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which we are longing for ought to be constantly poured into our ears or should ever proceed from our lips. For although the narration of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things be often repeated, yet in a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that feels a thirst for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the satiety will never create disgust, but as it receives it every day as if it were something new and what it wanted however often it may have taken it in, it will so much the more eagerly either hear or speak, and from the repetition of these things will gain confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> it already possesses, rather than weariness of any sort from the frequent Conference. For it is a sure sign of a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that is cold and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, if it receives with disdain and carelessness the medicine of the words of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, although it be offered with the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of excessive persistence. For <q>a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is full jeers at honeycomb: but to a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is in want even little things appear sweet.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351904"><a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse7">Proverbs&nbsp;27:7</a></span> And so if these things have been carefully taken in and stored up in the recesses of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and stamped with the seal of silence, afterwards like some sweet scented wine that makes glad the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, they will, when mellowed by the antiquity of the thoughts and by long-standing patience, be brought forth from the jar of your heart with great fragrance, and like some perennial fountain will flow abundantly from the veins of experience and irrigating channels of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and will pour forth copious streams as if from some deep well in your heart. For that will happen in your case, which is spoken in Proverbs to one who has achieved this in his work: <q>Drink waters from your own cisterns and from the fount of your own wells. Let waters from your own fountain flow in abundance for you, but let your waters pass through into your streets.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351905"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse15">Proverbs&nbsp;5:15-16</a></span> And according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah: <q>You shall be like a watered garden, and like a fountain of water whose waters shall not fail. And the places that have been desolate for ages shall be built in you; you shall raise up the foundations of generation and generation; and you shall be called the repairer of the fences, turning the paths into rest.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351906"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;58:11-12</a></span> And that blessedness shall come upon you which the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> promises: <q>And the Lord will not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> your teacher to flee away from you any more, and your eyes shall see your teacher. And your ears shall hear the word of one admonishing you behind your back: This is the way, walk in it, and go not aside either to the right hand or to the left.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351907"><a href="../bible/isa030.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;30:20-21</a></span> And so it will come to pass that not only every purpose and thought of your heart, but also all the wanderings and rovings of your imagination will become to you a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and unceasing pondering of the Divine law.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>How an unclean soul can neither give nor receive spiritual knowledge.</strong></p>

<p>But it is, as we have already said, impossible for a novice either to understand or to teach this. For if one is incapable of receiving it how can he be fit to pass it on to another? But if he has had the audacity to teach anything on these matters, most certainly his words will be idle and useless and only reach the ears of his hearers, without being able to touch their hearts, uttered as they were in sheer idleness and unfruitful vanity, for they do not proceed from the treasure of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, but from the empty impertinence of boastfulness. For it is impossible for an impure <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (however earnestly it may devote itself to reading) to obtain spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For no one pours any rich ointment or fine honey or any precious liquid into a dirty and stinking vessel. For a jar that has once been filled with foul odours spoils the sweetest myrrh more readily than it receives any sweetness or <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from it, for what is pure is corrupted much more quickly than what is corrupt is purified. And so the vessel of our bosom unless it has first been purified from all the foul stains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will not be worthy to receive that blessed ointment of which it is said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Like the ointment upon the head, which ran down upon the beard of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, which ran down upon the edge of his garment,</q>  nor will it keep undefiled that spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the words of Scripture which are <q>sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.</q>  <q>For what share has righteousness with iniquity? Or what agreement has light with darkness? Or what concord has Christ with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351910"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:14-15</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>An objection owing to the fact that many impure persons have knowledge while saints have not.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: This assertion does not seem to us founded on <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or based on solid reasoning. For if it is clear that all who either never receive the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Christ at all or who corrupt it by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, are of unclean hearts, how is it that many <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> also who are entangled in various <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, have acquired perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and boast of the greatness of their spiritual learning, and on the other hand countless swarms of saintly men, whose heart has been purified from all stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are content with the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of a deeper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? How then will that opinion stand, which attributes spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> solely to purity of heart?</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>The answer to the effect that bad men cannot possess true knowledge.</strong></p>

<p>Nesteros: One who does not carefully weigh every word of the opinions uttered cannot rightly discover the value of the assertion. For we said to begin with that men of this sort only possess skill in disputation and ornaments of speech; but cannot penetrate to the very heart of Scripture and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of its spiritual meanings. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is only acquired by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worshippers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and certainly this people does not possess it to whom it is said: <q>Hear, O, foolish people, you who have no heart: you who having eyes see not, and having ears, hear not.</q> And again: <q>Because you have rejected <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, I also will reject you from acting as My <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</q>  For as it is said that in Christ <q>all the treasures of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are hid,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351912"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse3">Colossians&nbsp;2:3</a></span> how can we hold that he who has scorned to find Christ, or, when He is found blasphemes Him with impious lips, or at least defiles the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by his impure <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, has acquired spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? <q>For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> will avoid deception, and dwells not in a body that is subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351913"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse4">Wisdom&nbsp;1:4-5</a></span> There is then no way of arriving at spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> but this which one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> has finely described: <q>Sow to yourselves for righteousness: reap the hope of life. Enlighten yourselves with the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351914"><a href="../bible/hos010.htm#verse12">Hosea&nbsp;10:12</a></span> First then we must sow for righteousness, i.e., by works of righteousness we must extend practical perfection; next we must reap the hope of life, i.e., by the expulsion of carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> must gather the fruits of spiritual <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: and so we shall succeed in enlightening ourselves with the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And the Psalmist also sees that this system ought to be followed, when he says: <q>Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way: who walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are they that seek His testimonies.</q>  For he does not say in the first place: <q>Blessed are they that seek His testimonies, and afterwards add: Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way;</q> but he begins by saying: <q>Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way;</q> and by this clearly shows that no one can properly come to seek God's testimonies unless he first walks undefiled in the way of Christ by his practical life. Those therefore whom you mentioned do not possess that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which the impure cannot attain, but <span class="greek">&#x03C8;&#x03B5;&#x03C5;&#x03B4;&#x1F7D;&#x03BD;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>, i.e., what is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called, of which the blessed Apostle speaks: <q>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to you, avoiding profane novelties of words, and oppositions of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351916"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:20</a></span> which is in the Greek <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F71;&#x03C2; &#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x03C8;&#x03B5;&#x03C5;&#x03B4;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;&#x1F7B;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C5; &#x03B3;&#x03BD;&#x1F7D;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span> . Of those then who seem to acquire some show of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or of those who while they devote themselves diligently to reading the sacred volume and to committing the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to memory, yet forsake not carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it is well said in Proverbs: <q>Like as a golden ring in a swine's snout so is the beauty of an evil-disposed <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351917"><a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;11:22</a></span> For what does it profit a man to gain the ornaments of heavenly eloquence and the most precious beauty of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> if by clinging to filthy <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and thoughts he destroys it by burying it in the foulest ground, or defiles it by the dirty wallowing of his own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>? For the result will be that which is an ornament to those who rightly use it, is not only unable to adorn them, but actually becomes dirty by the increased filth and mud. For <q>from the mouth of a sinner praise is not comely;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351918"><a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse9">Sirach&nbsp;15:9</a></span> as to him it is said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Wherefore do you declare My righteous acts, and takest My covenant in your lips?</q>  of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> like this, who never possess in any lasting fashion the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord of which it is said: <q>the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is instruction and wisdom,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351920"><a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse33">Proverbs&nbsp;15:33</a></span> and yet try to get at the meaning of Scripture by continual meditation on them, it is appropriately asked in Proverbs: <q>What use are riches to a fool? For a senseless man cannot possess wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351921"><a href="../bible/pro017.htm#verse16">Proverbs&nbsp;17:16</a></span> But so far is this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> removed from that worldly erudition, which is defiled by the stains of carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it has sometimes flourished most grandly in some who were without eloquence and almost illiterate. And this is very clearly shown by the case of the Apostles and many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, who did not spread themselves out with an empty show of leaves, but were bowed down by the weight of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fruits of spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: of whom it is written in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>But when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and unlearned men, they were astonished.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351922"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;4:13</a></span> And therefore if you are anxious to attain to that never-failing fragrance, you must first strive with all your might to obtain from the Lord the purity of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. For no one, in whom the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of carnal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and especially of fornication still holds sway, can acquire spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For <q>in a good heart wisdom will rest;</q> and: <q>He that fears the Lord shall find <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with righteousness.</q>  But that we must attain to spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the order of which we have already spoken, we are taught also by the blessed Apostle. For when he wanted not merely to draw up a list of all his own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but rather to describe their order, that he might explain which follows what, and which gives birth to what, after some others he proceeds as follows: <q>In watchings, in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in long suffering, in gentleness, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unfeigned.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351924"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:5-6</a></span> And by this enumeration of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> he evidently meant to teach us that we must come from watchings and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, from <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to long suffering, from long suffering to gentleness, from gentleness to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to the rewards of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unfeigned. When then by this system and in this order you too have come to spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, you will certainly have, as we said, not barren or idle learning but what is vigorous and fruitful; and the seed of the word of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which has been committed by you to the hearts of your hearers, will be watered by the plentiful showers of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> that will follow; and, according to this that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> promised, <q>the rain will be given to your seed, wherever you shall sow in the land, and the bread of the grain of the land shall be most plentiful and fat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351925"><a href="../bible/isa030.htm#verse23">Isaiah&nbsp;30:23</a></span> </p>

<p><strong>To whom the method of perfection should be laid open.</strong></p>

<p>Take care too, when your riper age leads you to teach, lest you be led astray by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of vainglory, and teach at random to the most impure <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> these things which you have learned not so much by reading as by the effects of experience, and so incur what Solomon, that wisest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, denounced: <q>Attach not a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man to the pastures of the just, and be not led astray by the fullness of the belly,</q> for <q>delicacies are not good for a fool, nor is there room for wisdom where sense is wanting: for folly is the more led on, because a stubborn servant is not improved by words, for even though he understands, he will not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>.</q> And <q>Do not say anything in the ears of an imprudent man, lest haply he mock at your wise speeches.</q>  And <q>give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to dogs, neither cast your pearls before swine, lest haply they trample them under foot and turn again and rend you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351927"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> It is right then to hide the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of spiritual meanings from men of this sort, that you may effectually sing: <q>Your words have I hid within my heart: that I should not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against You.</q>  But you will perhaps say: And to whom are the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> to be dispensed? Solomon, the wisest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, shall teach you: <q>Give, says he, strong drink to those who are in sorrow, and give wine to drink, to those who are in pain, that they may forget their poverty, and remember their pain no more,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351929"><a href="../bible/pro031.htm#verse6">Proverbs&nbsp;31:6-7</a></span> i.e., to those who in consequence of the punishment of their past actions are oppressed with grief and sorrow, supply richly the joys of spiritual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> like <q>wine that makes glad the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q>  and restore them with the strong drink of the word of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, lest haply they be plunged in continual sorrow and a despair that brings death, and so those who are of this sort be <q>swallowed up in overmuch sorrow.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351931"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> But of those who remain in coldness and carelessness, and are smitten by no sorrow of heart we read as follows: <q>For one who is kindly and without sorrow, shall be in want.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351932"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse23">Proverbs&nbsp;14:23</a></span> With all possible care therefore avoid being puffed up with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of vainglory, and so failing to become a partaker with him whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> praises, <q>who has not given his money upon <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>.</q>  For every one who, from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the praise of men dispenses the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of which it is said <q>the words of the Lord are pure words, as silver tried by the fire, purged from the earth, refined seven times,</q>  puts out his money upon <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, and will deserve for this not merely no reward, but rather punishment.

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p><strong>Of the reasons for which spiritual learning is unfruitful.</strong></p>

<p>But it is certain that for two reasons the teaching of spiritual things is ineffectual. For either the teacher is commending what he has no experience of, and is trying with empty-sounding words to instruct his hearer, or else the hearer is a bad man and full of faults and cannot receive in his hard heart the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and saving doctrine of the spiritual man; and of these it is said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>For the heart of this people is blinded, and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed: lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart and be converted and I should heal them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351936"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;6:10</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p><strong>How often even those who are not worthy can receive the grace of the saving word.</strong></p>

<p>But sometimes in the lavish generosity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His Providence, <q>Who wills all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved and to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351937"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:4</a></span> it is granted that one who has not shown himself by an irreproachable life to be worthy of the preaching of the gospel attains the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of spiritual teaching for the good of many. But by what means the gifts of healing are granted by the Lord for the expulsion of devils it follows that we must in a similar discussion explain, which as we are going to rise for supper we will keep for the evening, because that is always more effectually grasped by the heart which is taken in by degrees and without excessive bodily efforts.</p>
