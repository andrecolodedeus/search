<h1>Conference 15</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>THE SECOND CONFERENCE OF ABBOT NESTEROS. ON DIVINE GIFTS.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>Discourse of Abbot Nesteros on the threefold system of gifts.</strong></p>

<p>After evening service we sat down together on the mats as usual ready for the promised narration: and when we had kept silence for some little time out of reverence for the Elder, he anticipated the silence of our respect by such words as these. The previous order of our discourse had brought us to the exposition of the system of spiritual gifts, which we have learned from the tradition of the Elders is a threefold one. The first indeed is for the sake of healing, when the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of signs accompanies certain elect and righteous men on account of the merits of their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, as it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and many of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> wrought signs and wonders in accordance with the authority of the Lord Who says: <q>Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, cast out devils: freely you have received, freely give.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351938"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;10:8</a></span> The second when for the edification of the church or on account of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those who bring their sick, or of those who are to be cured, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of health proceeds even from sinners and men unworthy of it. Of whom the Saviour says in the gospel: <q>Many shall say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, and in Your name cast out devils, and in Your name done many mighty works? And then I will confess to them, I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you: Depart from Me, you workers of iniquity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351939"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;7:22-23</a></span> And on the other hand, if the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those who bring them or of the sick is wanting, it prevents those on whom the gifts of healing are conferred from exercising their powers of healing. On which subject Luke the Evangelist says: <q>And Jesus could not there do any mighty work because of their unbelief.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351940"><a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse5">Mark&nbsp;6:5-6</a></span> Whence also the Lord Himself says: <q>Many <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> were in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the days of Elisha the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351941"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;4:27</a></span> The third method of healing is copied by the deceit and contrivance of devils, that, when a man who is enslaved to evident <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is out of admiration for his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> regarded as a saint and a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, men may be persuaded to copy his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and thus an opening being made for cavilling, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of religion may be brought into disgrace, or else that he, who believes that he possesses the gift of healing, may be puffed up by <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of heart and so fall more grievously. Hence it is that invoking the names of those, who, as they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, have no merits of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> or any spiritual fruits, they pretend that by their merits they are disturbed and made to flee from the bodies they have possessed. Of which it says in Deuteronomy: <q>If there rise up in the midst of you a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, or one who says that he has seen a dream, and declare a sign and a wonder, and that which he has spoken comes to pass, and he say to you: Let us go and follow after other gods whom you know not, and let us serve them: you shall not hear the words of that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or of that dreamer, for the Lord your God is tempting you that it may appear whether you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him or not, with all your heart and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351942"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:1-3</a></span> And in the gospel it says: <q>There shall arise false Christs and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, and shall give great signs and wonders, so that, if it were possible, even the elect should be led astray.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351943"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;24:24</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>Wherein one ought to admire the saints.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore we never ought to admire those who affect these things, for these powers, but rather to look whether they are perfect in driving out all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and amending their ways, for this is granted to each man not for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of some other, or for a variety of reasons, but for his own earnestness, by the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For this is practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is termed by another name by the Apostle; viz., <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and is by the authority of the Apostle preferred to all tongues of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and to full assurance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which can even remove mountains, and to all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and to the distribution of all one's goods, and finally to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> itself. For when he had enumerated all kinds of gifts and had said: <q>To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to another the gift of healing, to another the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, etc.:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351944"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:8-10</a></span> when he was going to speak about <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> notice how in a few words he put it before all gifts: <q>And yet,</q> he says, <q>I show unto you a still more excellent way.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351945"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:31</a></span> By which it is clearly shown that the height of perfection and blessedness does not consist in the performance of those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> but in the purity of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And this not without good reason. For all those things are to pass away and be destroyed, but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is to abide for ever. And so we have never found that those works and signs were affected by our fathers: nay, rather when they did possess them by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> they would never use them, unless perhaps extreme and unavoidable necessity drove them to do so.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>Of a dead man raised to life by Abbot Macarius.</strong></p>

<p>As also we remember that a dead man was raised to life by Abbot Macarius who was the first to find a home in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Scete.  For when a certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who followed the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Eunomius was trying by dialectic subtlety to destroy the simplicity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and had already deceived a large number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the blessed Macarius was asked by some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who were terribly disturbed by the horror of such an upset, to set free the simple folk of all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> from the peril of infidelity, and came for this purpose. And when the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> had approached him with his dialectic art, and wanted to drag him away in his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to the thorns of Aristotle, the blessed Macarius put a stop to his chatter with apostolic brevity, saying: <q>the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351947"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:20</a></span> Let us go therefore to the tombs, and let us invoke the name of the Lord over the first dead man we find, and let us, as it is written, <q>show our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by our works,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351948"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse14">James&nbsp;2:14</a></span> that by His testimony the manifest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> may be shown, and we may prove the clear <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> not by an empty discussion of words but by the power of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and that judgment which cannot be deceived. And when he heard this the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> was overwhelmed with shame before the people who were present, and pretended for the moment that he consented to the terms proposed, and promised that he would come on the morrow, but the next day when they were all in expectation who had come together with greater eagerness to the appointed place, owing to their desire for the spectacle, he was terrified by the consciousness of his want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and fled away, and at once escaped out of all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And when the blessed Macarius had waited together with the people till the ninth hour, and saw that he had owing to his guilty <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> avoided him, he took the people, who had been perverted by him and went to the tombs determined upon. Now in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> the overflow of the river Nile has introduced this custom that, since the whole breadth of that country is covered for no small part of the year by the regular flood of waters like a great sea so that there is no means of getting about except by a passage in boats, the bodies of the dead are embalmed and stored away in cells an good height up. For the soil of that land being damp from the continual moisture prevents them from burying them. For if it receives any bodies buried in it, it is forced by the excessive inundations to cast them forth on its surface. When then the blessed Macarius had taken up his position by a most ancient corpse, he said <q>O man, if that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and son of perdition had come hither with me, and, while he was standing by, I had exclaimed and invoked the name of Christ my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, say in the presence of these who were almost perverted by his fraud, whether you would have arisen.</q> Then he arose and replied with words of assent. And then Abbot Macarius asked him what he had formerly been when he enjoyed life here, or in what age of men he had lived, or if he had then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and he replied that he had lived under kings of most ancient date, and declared that in those days he had never heard the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. To whom once more Abbot Macarius: <q>Sleep,</q> said he, <q>in peace with the others in your own order, to be roused again by Christ in the end.</q> All this power then and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of his which was in him would perhaps have always been hidden, unless the needs of the whole province which was endangered, and his entire devotion to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and unfeigned <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, had forced him to perform this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. And certainly it was not the ostentation of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> but the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ and the good of all the people that wrung from him the performance of it. As the passage in the book of Kings shows us that the blessed Elijah also did, who asked that fire might descend from heaven on the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> laid on the pyre, for this reason that he might set free the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the whole people which was endangered by the tricks of the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>Of the miracle which Abbot Abraham wrought on the breasts of a woman.</strong></p>

<p>Why also need I mention the acts of Abbot <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,  who was surnamed <span class="greek">&#x1F01;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;&#x03C2;</span>, i.e., the simple, from the simplicity of his life and his innocence. This man when he had gone from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> for the harvest in the season of Quinquagesima  was pestered with tears and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who brought her little child, already pining away and half dead from lack of milk; he gave her a cup of water to drink signed with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>; and when she had drunk it at once most marvellously her breasts that had been till then utterly dry flowed with a copious abundance of milk.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>Of the cure of a lame man which the same saint wrought.</strong></p>

<p>Or when the same man as he went to a village was surrounded by mocking crowds, who sneered at him and showed him a man who was for many years deprived of the power of walking from a contracted knee, and crawled from a weakness of long standing, they tempted him and said, <q>Show us, father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, if you are the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and restore this man to his former health, that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whom you worship, is not vain.</q> Then he at once invoked the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and stooped down and laid hold of the man's withered foot and pulled it. And immediately at his touch the dried and bent knee was straightened, and he got back the use of his legs, which he had forgotten how to use in his long years of weakness, and went away rejoicing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>How the merits of each man should not be judged by his miracles.</strong></p>

<p>And so these men gave no credit to themselves for their power of working such wonders, because they confessed that they were done not by their own merits but by the compassion of the Lord and with the words of the Apostle they refused the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> honour  offered out of admiration for their <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>: <q>Men and brethren, why do you marvel at this, or why do you look on us as though by our own power or <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> we had caused this man to walk.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351951"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse12">Acts&nbsp;3:12</a></span> Nor did they think that any one should be renowned for the gifts and marvels of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but rather for the fruits of his own good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, which are brought about by the efforts of his mind and the power of his works. For often, as was said above, men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, both cast out devils and perform the greatest <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the name of the Lord. Of whom when the Apostles complained and said: <q>Master, we saw one casting out devils in Your name, and we forbade him because he follows not with us,</q> though for the present Christ replied to them <q>Forbid him not, for he that is not against you is for you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351952"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;9:49-50</a></span> still when they say at the end: <q>Lord, Lord, have we not in Your name prophesied, and in Your name cast out devils, and in Your name done many mighty works?</q> He testifies that then He will answer: <q>I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you: depart from me, you workers of iniquity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351953"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;7:22-23</a></span> And therefore He actually warns those, to whom He Himself has given this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and mighty works because of their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, that they be not puffed up by them, saying: <q>Rejoice not because the devils are subject to you, but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> rather because your names are written in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351954"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;10:20</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>How the excellence of gifts consists not in miracles but in humility.</strong></p>

<p>Finally the Author Himself of all <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and mighty works, when He called His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to learn His teaching, clearly showed what those <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and specially chosen followers ought chiefly to learn from Him, saying: <q>Come and learn of Me,</q> not chiefly to cast out devils by the power of heaven, not to cleanse the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, not to give sight to the blind, not to raise the dead: for even though I do these things by some of My servants, yet man's estate cannot insert itself into the praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor can a minister and servant gather hereby any portion for himself there where is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Deity alone. But learn this of Me, He says, <q>for I am meek and lowly of heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351955"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;11:28-29</a></span> For this it is which it is possible for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> generally to learn and practise, but the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and signs is not always necessary, nor good for all, nor granted to all. Humility therefore is the mistress of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, it is the surest foundation of the heavenly building, it is the special and splendid gift of the Saviour. For he can perform all the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which Christ wrought, without danger of being puffed up, who follows the gentle Lord not in the grandeur of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of patience and humility. But he who aims at commanding unclean spirits, or bestowing gifts of healing, or showing some wonderful <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> to the people, even though when he is showing off he invokes the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, yet he is far from Christ, because in his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of heart he does not follow his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> Teacher. For when He was returning to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He prepared, so to speak, His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and left this to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>A new commandment,</q> said He, <q>give I unto you that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another; as I have loved you, so also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another:</q> and at once He subjoined: <q>By this shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are My <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if you have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351956"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;13:34-35</a></span> He says not: <q>if you do signs and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the same way,</q> but <q>if you have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to one another;</q> and this it is certain that none but the meek and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> can keep. Wherefore our predecessors never reckoned those as good <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or free from the fault of vainglory, who professed themselves exorcists among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and proclaimed with boastful ostentation among admiring crowds the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which they had either obtained or which they claimed. But in vain, for <q>he who trusts in lies feeds the winds: and the same runs after birds that fly away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351957"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse4">Proverbs&nbsp;10:4</a></span> For without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that will happen to them which we find in Proverbs: <q>As the winds and clouds and rain are very clear so are these who boast of a fictitious gift.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351958"><a href="../bible/pro025.htm#verse14">Proverbs&nbsp;25:14</a></span> And so if any one does any of these things in our presence, he ought to meet with commendation from us not from admiration of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but from the beauty of his life, nor should we ask whether the devils are subject to him, but whether he possesses those features of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which the Apostle describes.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>How it is more wonderful to have cast out one's faults from one's self than devils from another.</strong></p>

<p>And in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it is a greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> to root out from one's own flesh the incentives to wantonness than to cast out unclean spirits from the bodies of others, and it is a grander sign to restrain the fierce <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of patience than to command the powers of the air, and it is a greater thing to have shut out the devouring pangs of gloominess from one's own heart than to have expelled the sickness of another and the fever of his body. Finally it is in many ways a grander <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and a more splendid achievement to cure the weaknesses' of one's own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than those of the body of another. For just as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is higher than the flesh, so is its <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of more importance, and as its nature is more precious and excellent, so is its destruction more grievous and dangerous.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>How uprightness of life is of more importance than the working of miracles.</strong></p>

<p>And of those cures it was said to the blessed Apostles: <q>Rejoice not that the devils are subject to you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351959"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;10:20</a></span> For this was wrought not by their own power, but by the might of the name invoked. And therefore they are warned not to presume to claim for themselves any blessedness or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on this account as it was done simply by the power and might of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only on account of the inward purity of their life and heart, for which it was vouchsafed to them to have their names written in heaven.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>A revelation on the trial of perfect chastity.</strong></p>

<p>And to prove this that we have said both by the testimony of the ancients and divine oracles, we had better bring forward in his own words and experience what the blessed Paphnutius  felt on the subject of admiration of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of purity, or rather what he learned from the revelation of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. For this man had been famous for many years for his signal strictness so that he fancied that he was completely free from the snares of carnal concupiscence because he felt himself superior to all the attacks of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> with whom he had fought openly and for a long while; and when some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men had come to him, he was preparing for them a porridge of lentiles which they call Athera,  and his hand, as it happened, was burnt in the oven, by a flame that darted up. And when this happened he was much mortified and began silently to consider with himself, and ask why was not the fire at peace with me, when my more serious contests with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have ceased? Or how will that unquenchable fire which searches out the deserts of all pass me by in that dread day of judgment, and fail to detain me, if this trivial temporal fire from without has not spared me? And as he was troubled by thoughts of this kind and vexation a sudden sleep overcame him and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord came to him and said: <q>Paphnutius, why are you vexed because that earthly fire is not yet at peace with you, while there still remains in your members some disturbance of carnal motions that is not completely removed? For as long as the roots of this flourish within you, they will not suffer that material fire to be at peace with you. &nbsp;And certainly you could not feel it harmless unless you found by such <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> as these that all these internal motions within you were destroyed. Go, take a naked and most beautiful virgin, and if while you hold her you find that the peace of your heart remains steadfast, and that carnal heat is still and quiet within you, then the touch of this visible flame also shall pass over you gently and without harming you as it did over the three children in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</q> And so the Elder was impressed by this revelation and did not try the dangers of the experiment divinely shown to him, but asked his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and examined the purity of his heart; and, guessing that the weight of purity was not yet sufficient to outweigh the force of this trial, it is no wonder, said he, if when the battles with unclean spirits come upon me, I still feel the flames of the fire, which I used to think of less importance than the savage attacks of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, still raging against me. Since it is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and a grander <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to extinguish the inward <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh than by the sign of the Lord  and the power of the might of the Most High to subdue the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> which rush upon one from without, or to drive them by invoking the Divine name from the bodies which they have possessed. So far Abbot Nesteros, finishing the account of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> working of the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> accompanied us to the cell of the Elder Joseph which was nearly six miles distant from his, as we were eager for instruction in his doctrine.</p>
