<h1>Conference 16</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT JOSEPH. ON FRIENDSHIP.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>What Abbot Joseph asked us in the first instance.</strong></p>

<p>The blessed Joseph,  whose instructions and precepts are now to be set forth, and who was one of the three whom we mentioned in the first Conference,  belonged to a most illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and was the chief man of his city in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, which was named Thmuis,  and so was carefully trained in the eloquence of Greece as well as <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, so that he could talk admirably with us or with those who were utterly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, not as the others did through an interpreter, but in his own person. And when he found that we were anxious for instruction from him, he first inquired whether we were own brothers, and when he heard that we were united in a tie of spiritual and not carnal brotherhood, and that from the first commencement of our renunciation of the world we had always been joined together in an unbroken bond as well in our travels, which we had both undertaken for the sake of spiritual service, as also in the pursuits of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, he began his discourse as follows.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>Discourse of the same elder on the untrustworthy sort of friendship.</strong></p>

<p>There are many kinds of friendship and companionship which unite men in very different ways in the bonds of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For some a previous recommendation makes to enter upon an intercourse first of acquaintance and afterwards even of friendship. In the case of others some bargain or an agreement to give and take something has joined them in the bonds of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Others a similarity and union of business or science or art or study has united in the chain of friendship, by which even fierce <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> become kindly disposed to each other, so that those, who in forests and mountains delight in <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> and revel in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bloodshed, embrace and cherish the partners of their crimes. But there is another kind of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, where the union is from the instincts of nature and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of consanguinity, whereby those of the same tribe, wives and <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and brothers and children are naturally preferred to others, a thing which we find is the case not only with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> but with all birds and beasts. For at the prompting of a natural instinct they protect and defend their offspring and their young ones so that often they are not afraid to expose themselves to danger and death for their sakes. Indeed those kinds of beasts and serpents and birds, which are cut off and separated from all others by their intolerable ferocity or deadly poison, as basilisks, unicorns and vultures, though by their very look they are said to be dangerous to every one, yet among themselves they remain peaceful and harmless owing to community of origin and fellow-feeling. But we see that all these kinds of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of which we have spoken, as they are common both to the good and bad, and to beasts and serpents, certainly cannot last for ever. For often separation of place interrupts and breaks them off, as well as forgetfulness from lapse of time, and the transaction of affairs and business and words. For as they are generally due to different kinds of connexions either of gain, or desires, or kinship, or business, so when any occasion for separation intervenes they are broken off.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>How friendship is indissoluble.</strong></p>

<p>Among all these then there is one kind of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is indissoluble, where the union is owing not to the favour of a recommendation, or some great kindness or gifts, or the reason of some bargain, or the necessities of nature, but simply to similarity of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. This, I say, is what is broken by no chances, what no interval of time or space can sever or destroy, and what even death itself cannot part. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and unbroken <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which grows by means of the double perfection and goodness of friends, and which, when once its bonds have been entered, no difference of liking and no disturbing opposition of wishes can sever. But we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> many set on this purpose, who though they had been joined together in companionship out of their burning <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, yet could not maintain it continually and unbrokenly, because although they relied on a good beginning for their friendship, yet they did not with one and the same <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> maintain the purpose on which they had entered, and so there was between them a sort of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> only for a while, for it was not maintained by the goodness of both alike, but by the patience of the one party, and so although it is held to by the one with unwearied heroism, yet it is sure to be broken by the pettiness of the other. For the infirmities of those who are somewhat cold in seeking the healthy condition of perfection, however patiently they may be borne by the strong, are yet not put up with by those who are weaker themselves. For they have implanted within them causes of disturbance which do not allow them to be at ease, just as those, who are affected by bodily weakness, generally impute the delicacy of their stomach and weak health to the carelessness of their cooks and servants, and however carefully their attendants may serve them, yet nevertheless they ascribe the grounds of their upset to those who are in good health, as they do not see that they are really due to the failure of their own health. Wherefore this, as we said, is the sure and indissoluble union of friendship, where the tie consists only in likeness in goodness. For <q>the Lord makes men to be of one mind in an house.</q>  And therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> can only continue undisturbed in those in whom there is but one purpose and mind to will and to refuse the same things. And if you also wish to keep this unbroken, you must be careful that having first got rid of your faults, you mortify your own desires, and with united <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and purpose diligently fulfil that in which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> specially delights: <q>Behold how good and joyful a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.</q>  Which should be taken of unity of spirit rather than of place. For it is of no use for those who differ in character and purpose to be united in one dwelling, nor is it an hindrance for those who are grounded on equal goodness to be separated by distance of place. For with God the union of character, not of place, joins brethren together in a common dwelling, nor can unruffled peace ever be maintained where difference of will appears.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>A question whether anything that is really useful should be performed even against a brother's wish.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: What then? If when one party wants to do something which he sees is useful and profitable according to the mind of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other does not give his consent, ought it to be performed even against the wish of the brother, or should it be thrown on one side as he wants?</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>The answer, how a lasting friendship can only exist among those who are perfect.</strong></p>

<p>Joseph: For this reason we said that the full and perfect <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of friendship can only last among those who are perfect and of equal goodness, whose likemindedness and common purpose allows them either never, or at any rate hardly ever, to disagree, or to differ in those matters which concern their progress in the spiritual life. But if they begin to get hot with eager disputes, it is clear that they have never been at one in accordance with the rule which we gave above. But because no one can start from perfection except one who has begun from the very foundation, and your inquiring is not with regard to its greatness, but as to how you can attain to it, I think it well to explain to you, in a few words, the rule for it and the sort of path along which your steps should be directed, that you may be able more easily to secure the blessing of patience and peace.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>By what means union can be preserved unbroken.</strong></p>

<p>The first foundation then, of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> friendship consists in contempt for worldly substance and scorn for all things that we possess. For it is utterly wrong and unjustifiable if, after the vanity of the world and all that is in it has been renounced, whatever miserable furniture remains is more regarded than what is most valuable; viz., the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of a brother. The second is for each man so to prune his own wishes that he may not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> himself to be a wise and experienced person, and so prefer his own opinions to those of his neighbour. The third is for him to recognize that everything, even what he deems useful and necessary, must come after the blessing of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and peace. The fourth for him to realize that he should never be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> for any reason good or bad. The fifth for him to try to cure any <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> which a brother may have conceived against him however unreasonably, in the same way that he would cure his own, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the vexation of another is equally bad for him, as if he himself were stirred against another, unless he removes it, to the best of his ability, from his brother's mind. The last is what is undoubtedly generally decisive in regard to all faults; viz., that he should realize daily that he is to pass away from this world; as the realization of this not only permits no vexation to linger in the heart, but also represses all the motions of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all kinds. Whoever then has got hold of this, can neither suffer nor be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of bitter <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and discord. But when this fails, as soon as he who is jealous of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has little by little infused the poison of vexation in the hearts of friends, it is certain that owing to frequent quarrels <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> will gradually grow cool, and at sometime or other he will part the hearts of the lovers, that have been for a long while exasperated. For if one is walking along the course previously marked out, how can he ever differ from his friend, for if he claims nothing for himself, he entirely cuts off the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of quarrel (which generally springs from trivial things and most unimportant matters), as he observes to the best of his power what we read in the Acts of the Apostles on the unity of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>: <q>But the multitude of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> was of one heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; neither did any of them say that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things common.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351968"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse32">Acts&nbsp;4:32</a></span> Then how can any seeds of discussion arise from him who serves not his own but his brother's will, and becomes a follower of his Lord and Master, who speaking in the character  of man which He had taken, said: <q>I am not come to do My own will, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent Me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351970"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;6:38</a></span> But how can he arouse any incitement to contention, who has determined to trust not so much to his own judgment as to his brother's decision, on his own intelligence and meaning, in accordance with his will either approving or disapproving his discoveries, and fulfilling in the humility of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> heart these words from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351971"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;26:39</a></span> Or in what way will he admit anything which grieves the brother, who thinks that nothing is more precious than the blessing of peace, and never forgets these words of the Lord: <q>By this shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are My <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351972"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;13:35</a></span> for by this, as by a special mark, Christ willed that the flock of His sheep should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in this world, and be separated from all others by this stamp, so to speak? But on what grounds will he endure either to admit the rancour of vexation in himself or for it to remain in another, if his firm decision is that there cannot be any good ground for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as it is dangerous and wrong, and that when his broker is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with him he cannot <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, in just the same way as when he himself is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother, as he ever keeps in an <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> heart these words of our Lord and Saviour: <q>If you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you, leave there your gift at the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351973"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;5:23-24</a></span> For it will be of no use for you to declare that you are not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you are fulfilling the command which says: <q>Let not the sun go down upon your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>;</q> and: <q>Whosoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment,</q>  if you are with obstinate heart disregarding the vexation of another which you could smooth down by kindness on your part. For in the same way you will be punished for violating the Lord's command. For He who said that you should not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with another, said also that you should not disregard the vexations of another, for it makes no difference in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Who wills all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351975"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:4</a></span> whether you destroy yourself or someone else. Since the death of any one is equally a loss to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and at the same time it is equally a gain to him to whom all destruction is delightful, whether it is acquired by your death or by the death of your brother. Lastly, how can he retain even the least vexation with his brother, who realizes daily that he is presently to depart from this world?</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>How nothing should be put before love, or after anger.</strong></p>

<p>As then nothing should be put before <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, so on the other hand nothing should be put below rage and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For all things, however useful and necessary they seem, should yet be disregarded that disturbing <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> may be avoided, and all things even which we think are unfortunate should be undertaken and endured that the calm of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and peace may be preserved unimpaired, because we should reckon nothing more damaging than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and vexation, and nothing more advantageous than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>On what grounds a dispute can arise among spiritual persons.</strong></p>

<p>For as our enemy separates brethren who are still weak and carnal by a sudden burst of rage on account of some trifling and earthly matter, so he sows the seeds of discord even between spiritual <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, on the ground of some difference of thoughts, from which certainly those contentions and strifes about words, which the Apostle condemns, for the most part arise: whereby consequently our spiteful and malignant enemy sows discord between brethren who were of one mind. For these words of wise Solomon are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: <q>Contention breeds <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>: but friendship will be a defence to all who do not strive.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351976"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;10:12</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>How to get rid even of spiritual grounds of discord.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore for the preservation of lasting and unbroken <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, it is of no use to have removed the first ground of discord, which generally arises from frail and earthly things, or to have disregarded all carnal things, and to have permitted to our brethren an unrestricted share in everything which our needs require, unless too we cut off in like manner the second, which generally arises under the guise of spiritual feelings; and unless we gain in everything <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> thoughts and harmonious wills.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>On the best tests of truth.</strong></p>

<p>For I remember, that when my youthful age suggested to me to cling to a partner, thoughts of this sort often mingled with our moral training and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, so that we fancied that nothing could be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> or more reasonable: but when we came together and began to produce our ideas, in the general discussion which was held, some things were first noted by the others as false and dangerous, and then presently were condemned and pronounced by common consent to be injurious; though before they had seemed to shine as if with a light infused by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, so that they would easily have caused discord, had not the charge of the Elders, observed like some divine oracle, restrained us from all strife, that charge; namely, whereby it was ordered by them almost with the force of a law, that neither of us should trust to his own judgments more than his brother's, if he wanted never to be deceived by the craft of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>How it is impossible for one who trusts to his own judgment to escape being deceived by the devil's illusions.</strong></p>

<p>For often it has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that what the Apostle says really takes place. <q>For <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> himself transforms himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351977"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14</a></span> so that he deceitfully sheds abroad a confusing and foul obscuration of the thoughts instead of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And unless these thoughts are received in a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and gentle heart, and kept for the consideration of some more experienced brother or approved Elder, and when thoroughly sifted by their judgment, either rejected or admitted by us, we shall be sure to venerate in our thoughts an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of darkness instead of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light, and be smitten with a grievous destruction: an injury which it is impossible for any one to avoid who trusts in his own judgment, unless he becomes a lover and follower of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humility and with all contrition of heart fulfils what the Apostle chiefly <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for: <q>If then there be any consolation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if any comfort of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, if any bowels of compassion, fulfil my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that you be of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, having the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, being of one accord, doing nothing by contention, neither by vainglory; but in humility each esteeming others better than themselves;</q> and this: <q>in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> preferring one another,</q>  that each may think more of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of his partner, and hold that the better part of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> discretion is to be found in the judgment of another rather than in his own.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>Why inferiors should not be despised in Conference.</strong></p>

<p>For it often happens either by an illusion of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> or by the occurrence of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mistake (by which every man in this life is liable to be deceived) that sometimes one who is keener in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and more learned, gets some wrong notion in his head, while he who is duller in wits and of less worth, conceives the matter better and more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>. And therefore no one, however learned he may be, should persuade himself in his empty vanity that he cannot require conference with another. For even if no deception of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> blinds his judgment, yet he cannot avoid the noxious snares of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and conceit. For who can arrogate this to himself without great danger, when the chosen vessel in whom, as he maintained, Christ Himself spoke, declares that he went up to Jerusalem simply and solely for this reason, that he might in a secret discussion confer with his fellow-Apostles on the gospel which he preached to the gentiles by the revelation and co-operation of the Lord? By which fact we are shown that we ought not only by these precepts to preserve unanimity and harmony, but that we need not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> any crafts of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> opposing us, or snares of his illusions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><strong>How love does not only belong to God but is God.</strong></p>

<p>Finally so highly is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> extolled that the blessed Apostle John declares that it not only belongs to God but that it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: he therefore that abides in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, abides in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351979"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:16</a></span> For so far do we see that it is divine, that we find that what the Apostle says is plainly a living <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in us: <q>For the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who dwells in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351980"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> For it is the same thing as if he said that God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who dwells in us: who also, when we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for, <q>makes intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered: But He that searches the hearts <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what the Spirit desires, for He asks for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351981"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;8:26-27</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>On the different grades of love.</strong></p>

<p>It is possible then for all to show that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is called <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03B3;&#x1F71;&#x03C0;&#x03B7;</span>, of which the blessed Apostle says: <q>While therefore we have time, let us do good unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but specially to them that are of the household of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351982"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse10">Galatians&nbsp;6:10</a></span> And this should be shown to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in general to such an extent that we are actually commanded by our Lord to yield it to our enemies, for He says: <q>Love your enemies.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351983"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44</a></span> But <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x1F71;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>, i.e., affection is shown to but a few and those who are united to us by kindred dispositions or by a tie of goodness; though indeed affection seems to have many degrees of difference. For in one way we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, in another our wives, in another our brothers, in another our children, and there is a wide difference in regard to the claims of these feelings of affection, nor is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> towards their children always equal. As is shown by the case of the patriarch Jacob, who, though he was the father of twelve sons and loved them all with a father's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, yet loved Joseph with deeper affection, as Scripture clearly shows: <q>But his brethren envied him, because his father loved him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351984"><a href="../bible/gen037.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;37:4</a></span> evidently not that that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man his father failed in greatly loving the rest of his children, but that in his affection he clung to this one, because he was a type of the Lord, more tenderly and indulgently. This also, we read, was very clearly shown in the case of John the Evangelist, where these words are used of him: <q>that <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> whom Jesus loved,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351985"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;13:23</a></span> though certainly He embraced all the other eleven, whom He had chosen in the same way, with His special <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as this He shows also by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the gospel, where He says: <q>As I have loved you, so also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another;</q> of whom elsewhere also it is said: <q>Loving His own who were in the world, He loved them even to the end.</q>  But this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of one in particular did not indicate any coldness in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the rest of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but only a fuller and more abundant <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards the one, which his prerogative of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and the purity of his flesh bestowed upon him. And therefore it is marked by exceptional treatment, as being something more sublime, because no hateful comparison with others, but a richer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of superabundant <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> singled it out. Something of this sort too we have in the character of the bride in the Song of Songs, where she says: <q>Set in order <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351987"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse4">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:4</a></span> For this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> set in order, which, while it <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> no one, yet loves some still more by reason of their deserving it, and which, while it loves all in general, singles out for itself some from those, whom it may embrace with a special affection, and again among those, who are the special and chief objects of its <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, singles out some who are preferred to others in affection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>Of those who only increase their own or their brother's grievances by hiding them.</strong></p>

<p>On the other hand we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> (and O! Would that we did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>) some of the brethren who are so hard and obstinate, that when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that their own feelings are aroused against their brother, or that their brother's are against them, in order to conceal their vexation of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is caused by indignation at the grievance of one or the other, go apart from those whom they ought to smooth down by humbly making up to them and talking with them; and begin to sing some verses of the Psalms. And these while they fancy that they are softening the bitter thoughts which have arisen in their heart, increase by their insolent conduct what they could have got rid of at once if they had been willing to show more care and humility, for a well-timed expression of regret would cure their own feelings and soften their brother's heart. For by that plan they nourish and cherish the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of meanness or rather of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, instead of stamping out all inducement to quarrelling, and they forget the charge of the Lord which says: <q>Whosoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother, is in danger of the judgment;</q> and: <q>if you remember that your brother has anything against you, leave there your gift before the altar, and go your way, first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351988"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22-24</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>How it is that, if our brother has any grudge against us, the gifts of our prayers are rejected by the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>So far therefore is our Lord anxious that we should not disregard the vexation of another that He does not accept our offerings if our brother has anything against us, i.e., He does not allow <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be offered by us to Him until by speedy amends we remove from his (our brother's) mind the vexation which he whether rightly or wrongly feels. For He does not say: <q>if your brother has a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> ground for complaint against you leave your gift at the altar, and go your way, first be reconciled to him;</q> but He says: <q>if you remember that your brother has anything against you,</q> i.e., if there be anything however trivial or small, owing to which your brother's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is roused against you, and this comes back to your recollection by a sudden remembrance, you must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you ought not to offer the spiritual gift of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> until by kindly amends you have removed from your brother's heart the vexation arising from whatever <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. If then the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> bid us make satisfaction to those who are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> for past and utterly trivial grounds of quarrel, and those which have arisen from the slightest causes, what will become of us wretches who with obstinate hypocrisy disregard more recent grounds of offense, and those of the utmost importance, and due to our own faults; and being puffed up with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> own <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, as we are ashamed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> ourselves, deny that we are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our brother's vexation and in a spirit of rebellion disdaining to be subject to the Lord's commands, contend that they never ought to be observed and never can be fulfilled? And so it comes to pass that as we make up our minds that He has commanded things which are impossible and unsuitable, we become, to use the Apostle's expression, <q>not doers but judges of the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351989"><a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse11">James&nbsp;4:11</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p><strong>Of those who hold that patience should be shown to worldly people rather than to the brethren.</strong></p>

<p>This too should be bitterly lamented; namely, that some of the brethren, when angered by some reproachful words, if they are besieged by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of some one else who wants to smooth them down, when they hear that vexation ought not to be admitted or retained against a brother, according to what is written: <q>Whoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother is in danger of the judgment;</q> and: <q>Let not the sun go down upon your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351990"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse26">Ephesians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> instantly assert that if a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> or one living in the world had said or done this, it rightly ought to be endured. But who could stand a brother who was accessory to so great a fault, or gave utterance to so insolent a reproach with his lips! As if patience were to be shown only to unbelievers and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>, and not to all in general, or as if <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> should be reckoned as bad when it is against a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, but good when it is against a brother; whereas certainly the obstinate rage of an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> brings about the same injury to one's self whoever may be the subject against whom it is aroused. But how terribly obstinate, aye and senseless is it for them, owing to the stupidity of their dull <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not to be able to discern the meaning of these words, for it is not said: <q>Every one who is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with a stranger shall be in danger of the judgment,</q> which might perhaps according to their interpretation except those who are partners of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and life, but the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> most significantly expresses it by saying: <q>Every one who is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment.</q> And so though we ought according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to regard every man as a brother, yet in this passage one of the faithful and a partaker of our mode of life is denoted by the title of brother rather than a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p><strong>Of those who pretend to patience but excite their brethren to anger by their silence.</strong></p>

<p>But what sort of a thing is this, that sometimes we fancy that we are patient because when provoked we scorn to answer, but by sullen silence or scornful motions and gestures so mock at our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> brothers that by our silent looks we provoke them to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> more than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> reproaches would have excited them, meanwhile thinking that we are in no way guilty before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because we have let nothing fall from our lips which could brand us or condemn us in the judgment of men. As if in the sight of God mere words, and not mainly the will was called in fault, and as if only the actual deed of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and not also the wish and purpose, was reckoned as wrong; or as if it would be asked in the judgment only what each one had done and not what he also purposed to do. For it is not only the character of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> roused, but also the purpose of the man who provokes it which is bad, and therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> scrutiny of our judge will ask, not how the quarrel was stirred up but by whose fault it arose: for the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and not the way in which the fault is committed must be taken into account. For what does it matter whether a man kills a brother with a sword by himself, or drives him to death by some fraud, when it is clear that he is killed by his wiles and crime? As if it were enough not to have pushed a blind man down with one's own hand, though he is equally guilty who scorned to save him, when it was in his power, when fallen and on the point of tumbling into the ditch: or as if he alone were guilty who had caught a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with the hand, and not also the one who had prepared and set the trap for him, or who would not set him free when he might have done so. So then it is of no good to hold one's tongue, if we impose silence upon ourselves for this reason that by our silence we may do what would have been done by an outcry on our part, simulating certain gestures by which he whom we ought to have cured, may be made still more <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, while we are commended for all this, to his loss and damage: as if a man were not for this very reason the more guilty, because he tried to get <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for himself out of his brother's fall. For such a silence will be equally bad for both because while it increases the vexation in the heart of another, so it prevents it from being removed from one's own: and against such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> curse is with good reason directed: <q>Woe to him that gives drink to his friend, and presents his gall, and makes him drunk, that he may behold his nakedness. He is filled with shame instead of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351991"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse15">Habakkuk&nbsp;2:15-16</a></span> And this too which is said of such people by another: <q>For every brother will utterly supplant, and every friend will walk deceitfully. And a man shall mock his brother, and they will not speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for they have bent their tongue like a bow for lies and not for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351992"><a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse4">Jeremiah&nbsp;9:4-5</a></span> But often a feigned patience excites to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> more keenly than words, and a spiteful silence exceeds the most awful insults in words, and the wounds of enemies are more easily borne than the deceitful blandishment of mockers, of which it is well said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Their words are smoother than oil, and yet they are darts:</q> and elsewhere <q>the words of the crafty are soft: but they smite within the belly:</q> to which this also may be finely applied: <q>With the mouth he speaks peace to his friend, but secretly he lays snares for him;</q> with which however the deceiver is rather deceived, for <q>if a man prepares a net before his friend, it surrounds his own feet;</q> and: <q>if a man digs a pit for his neighbour, he shall fall into it himself.</q>  Lastly when a great multitude had come with swords and staves to take the Lord, none of the murderers of the author of our life stood forth as more cruel than he who advanced before them all with a counterfeit respect and salutation and offered a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of feigned <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; to whom the Lord said: <q>Judas, do you betray the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351994"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;22:48</a></span> i.e., the bitterness of your <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> has taken as a cloke this which expresses the sweetness of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. More openly too and more energetically does He emphasize the force of this grief by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying: <q>For if mine enemy had cursed me, I would have borne it: and if he who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me had spoken great things against me, I would have hid myself from him. But it was you, a man of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, my guide, and my familiar friend: who took sweet meats together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p><strong>Of those who fast out of rage.</strong></p>

<p>There is too another <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> sort of vexation which would not be worth mentioning were it not that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it is allowed by some of the brethren who, when they have been vexed or enraged actually abstain persistently from food, so that (a thing which we cannot mention without shame) those who when they are calm declare that they cannot possibly put off their refreshment to the sixth or at most the ninth hour, when they are filled with vexation and rage do not feel <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> even for two days, and support themselves, when exhausted by such abstinence, by a surfeit of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Wherein they are plainly guilty of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of sacrilege, as out of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> own rage they endure <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> which ought specially to be offered to God alone out of desire for humiliation of heart and purification from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: which is much the same as if they were to offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> not to God but to devils, and so be worthy of hearing this rebuke of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>They <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to devils and not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to gods whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351996"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:17</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p><strong>Of the feigned patience of some who offer the other cheek to be smitten.</strong></p>

<p>We are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> also of another kind of insanity, which we find in some of the brethren under colour of a counterfeit patience, as in this case it is not enough to have stirred up quarrels unless they incite them with irritating words so as to get themselves smitten, and when they have been touched by the slightest blow, at once they offer another part of their body to be smitten, as if in this way they could fulfil to perfection that command which says: <q>If a man smite you on the right cheek, offer him the other also;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351997"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;5:39</a></span> while they totally ignore the meaning and purpose of the passage. For they fancy that they are practising evangelical patience through the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, for the utter eradication of which not only was the exchange of retaliation and the irritation of strife forbidden, but the command was actually given us to mitigate the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the striker by the endurance of a double wrong.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p><strong>A question how if we obey the commands of Christ we can fail of evangelical perfection.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: How can we blame one who satisfies the command of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and not only does not retaliate, but is actually prepared to have a double wrong offered to him?</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p><strong>The answer that Christ looks not only at the action but also at the will.</strong></p>

<p>Joseph: As was said a little before, we must look not only at the thing which is done, but also at the character of the mind and the purpose of the doer. And therefore if you weigh with a careful scrutiny of heart what is done by each man and consider with what mind it is done or from what feeling it proceeds, you will see that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of patience and gentleness cannot possibly be fulfilled in the opposite spirit, i.e., that of impatience and rage. Since our Lord and Saviour, when giving us a thorough lesson on the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of patience and gentleness (i.e., teaching us not only to profess it with our lips, but to store it up in the inmost recesses of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>) gave us this summary of evangelical perfection, saying: <q>If any one smites you on your right cheek, offer him the other also</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351998"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39"> <em>Ibid</em></a></span> (doubtless the <q> <em>right</em></q> cheek is mentioned, as another <q>right</q> cheek cannot be found except in the face of the inner man, so to speak), as by this He desires entirely to remove all incitement to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> from the deepest recesses of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, i.e., that if your external right cheek has received a blow from the striker, the inner man also humbly consenting may offer its right cheek to be smitten, sympathizing with the suffering of the outward man, and in a way submitting and subjecting its own body to wrong from the striker, that the inner man may not even silently be disturbed in itself at the blows of the outward man. You see then that they are very far from evangelical perfection, which teaches that patience must be maintained, not in words but in inward tranquillity of heart, and which bids us preserve it whatever <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> happens, that we may not only keep ourselves always from disturbing <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but also by submitting to their injuries compel those, who are disturbed by their own fault, to become calm, when they have had their fill of blows; and so overcome their rage by our gentleness. And so also we shall fulfil these words of the Apostle: <q>Be not overcome of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but overcome <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with good.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351999"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;12:21</a></span> And it is quite clear that this cannot be fulfilled by those who utter words of gentleness and humility in such a spirit and rage that they not only fail to lessen the fire of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> which has been kindled, but rather make it blaze up the more fiercely both in their own feelings and in those of their enraged brother. But these, even if they could in some way keep calm and quiet themselves, would yet not bear any fruits of righteousness, while they claim the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of patience on their part by their neighbour's loss, and are thus altogether removed from that Apostolic <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which <q>Seeks not her own,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352000"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:5</a></span> but the things of others. For it does not so desire riches in such a way as to make profit for itself out of one's neighbour's loss, nor does it wish to gain anything if it involves the spoiling of another.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p><strong>How he is the strong and vigorous man, who yields to the will of another.</strong></p>

<p>But you must certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in general he plays a stronger part who subjects his own will to his brother's, than he who is found to be the more pertinacious in defending and clinging to his own decisions. For the former by bearing and putting up with his neighbour gains the character of being strong and vigorous, while the latter gains that of being weak and sickly, who must be pampered and petted so that sometimes for the sake of his peace and quiet it is a good thing to relax something even in necessary matters. And indeed in this he need not fancy that he has lost anything of his own perfection, though by yielding he has given up something of his intended strictness, but on the contrary he may be sure that he has gained much more by his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of long-suffering and patience. For this is the Apostle's command: <q>You who are strong should bear the infirmities of the weak;</q> and: <q>Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q>  For a weak man will never support a weak man, nor can one who is suffering in the same way, bear or cure one in feeble health, but one who is himself not subject to infirmity brings remedies to one in weak health. For it is rightly said to him: <q>Physician, heal yourself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352002"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;4:23</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p><strong>How the weak are harmful and cannot bear wrongs.</strong></p>

<p>We must note too the fact that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the weak is always such that they are quick and ready to offer reproaches and sow the seeds of quarrels, while they themselves cannot bear to be touched by the shadow of the very slightest wrong, and while they are riding roughshod over us and flinging about wanton charges, they are not able to bear even the slightest and most trivial ones themselves. And so according to the aforesaid opinion of the Elders <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> cannot last firm and unbroken except among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the same purpose and goodness. For at some time or other it is sure to be broken, however carefully it may be guarded by one of them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p><strong>A question how he can be strong who does not always support the weak.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: How then can the patience of a perfect man be worthy of praise if it cannot always bear the weak?</p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p><strong>The answer that the weak does not always allow himself to be borne.</strong></p>

<p>Joseph: I did not say that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and endurance of one who is strong and robust would be overcome, but that the miserable condition of the weak, encouraged by the tolerance of the perfect, and daily growing worse, is sure to give rise to reasons on account of which he himself ought no longer to be borne; or else with a shrewd suspicion that the patience of his neighbour shows up and sets off his own impatience at some time or other he chooses to make off rather than always to be borne by the magnanimity of the other. This then we think should be above all else observed by those who want to keep the affection   of their companions unimpaired; viz., that first of all when provoked by any wrongs, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> should keep not only his lips but even the depth of his breast unmoved: but if he finds that they are even slightly disturbed, let him keep himself in by entire silence, and diligently observe what the Psalmist speaks of: <q>I was troubled and spoke nothing;</q> and: <q>I said I will take heed to your ways that I offend not with my tongue. I have set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against me. I was dumb and was humbled, and kept silence from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things;</q>  and he should not pay any heed to his present state, nor give vent to what his violent rage suggests and his exasperated mind expresses at the moment, but should dwell on the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of past <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> or look forward in his mind to the renewal and restoration of peace, and contemplate it even in the very hour of rage, as if it were sure presently to return. And while he is reserving himself for the delight of harmony soon to come, he will not feel the bitterness of the present quarrel and will easily make such answers that, when <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is restored, he will not be able to accuse himself as guilty or be blamed by the other; and thus he will fulfil these words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>In <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> remember mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352004"><a href="../bible/hab003.htm#verse2">Habakkuk&nbsp;3:2</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

<p><strong>How anger should be repressed.</strong></p>

<p>We ought then to restrain every movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and moderate it under the direction of discretion, that we may not by blind rage be hurried into that which is condemned by Solomon: <q>The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man expends all his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but the wise man dispenses it bit by bit,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352005"><a href="../bible/pro029.htm#verse11">Proverbs&nbsp;29:11</a></span> i.e., a fool is inflamed by the passion of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> to avenge himself; but a wise man, by the ripeness of his counsel and moderation little by little diminishes it, and gets rid of it. Something of the same kind too is this which is said by the Apostle: <q>Not avenging yourselves, dearly beloved: but give place to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352006"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;12:19</a></span> i.e., do not under the compulsion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> proceed to vengeance, but give place to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, i.e., do not let your hearts be confined in the straits of impatience and cowardice so that, when a fierce storm of passion rises, you cannot endure it; but be enlarged in your hearts, receiving the adverse waves of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in the wide gulf of that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which <q>suffers all things, bears all things;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352007"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:7</a></span> and so your mind will be enlarged with wide long-suffering and patience, and will have within it safe recesses of counsel, in which the foul smoke of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> will be received and be diffused and immediately vanish away; or else the passage may be taken in this way: we give place to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, as often as we yield with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and tranquil mind to the passion of another, and bow to the impatience of the passionate, as if we admitted that we deserved any kind of wrong. But those who twist the meaning of the perfection of which the Apostle speaks so as to make out that those give place to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, who go away from a man in a rage, seem to me not to cut off but rather to foment the incitement to quarrelling, for unless a neighbour's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is overcome at once by amends being humbly made, a man provokes rather than avoids it by his flight. And there is something like this that Solomon says: <q>Be not hasty in your spirit to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> reposes in the bosom of fools;</q> and: <q>Be not quick to rush into a quarrel, lest you repent thereof at the last.</q>  For he does not blame a hasty exhibition of quarrelling and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in such a way as to praise a tardy one. In the same way too must this be taken: <q>A fool declares his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in the very same hour, but a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man hides his shame.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352009"><a href="../bible/pro012.htm#verse16">Proverbs&nbsp;12:16</a></span> For he does not lay it down that a shameful outburst of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> ought to be hidden by wise men in such a way that while he blames a speedy outburst of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> he fails to forbid a tardy one, as certainly, if owing to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness it does burst forth, he means that it should be hidden for this reason, that while for the moment it is wisely covered up, it may be destroyed forever. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is such that when it is given room it languishes and perishes, but if openly exhibited, it burns more and more. The hearts then should be enlarged and opened wide, lest they be confined in the narrow straits of cowardice, and be filled with the swelling surge of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and so we become unable to receive what the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> calls the <q>exceeding broad</q> commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in our narrow heart, or to say with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>I have run the way of your commandments for you have enlarged my heart.</q>  For that long-suffering is wisdom we are taught by very clear passages of Scripture: for <q>a man who is long-suffering is great in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; but a coward is very foolish.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352011"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse29">Proverbs&nbsp;14:29</a></span> And therefore <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says of him who to his credit asked the gift of wisdom from the Lord: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave Solomon wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> exceeding much, and largeness of heart as the sand of the sea for multitude.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352012"><a href="../bible/1ki004.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;4:29</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<p><strong>How friendships entered upon by conspiracy cannot be lasting ones.</strong></p>

<p>This too has been often <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by many experiments; viz., that those who entered the bonds of friendship from a beginning of conspiracy, cannot possibly preserve their harmony unbroken; either because they tried to keep it not out of their desire for perfection nor because of the sway of Apostolic <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but out of earthly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and because of their wants and the bonds of their agreement; or else because that most crafty foe of ours hurries them on the more speedily to break the chains of their friendship in order that he may make them breakers of their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. This opinion then of the most <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> men is most certainly established; viz., that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> harmony and undivided union can only exist among those whose life is pure, and who are men of the same goodness and purpose.</p>

<p>Thus much the blessed Joseph discoursed in his spiritual talk on friendship, and fired us with a more ardent desire to preserve the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of our fellowship as a lasting one.</p>
