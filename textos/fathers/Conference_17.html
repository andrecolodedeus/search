<h1>Conference 17</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>THE SECOND CONFERENCE OF ABBOT JOSEPH. ON MAKING PROMISES.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>Of the vigils which we endured.</strong></p>

<p>When then the previous Conference was ended, and the intervening silence of night as well, as we had been conducted by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Abbot Joseph to a separate cell for the sake of quiet, but had passed the whole night without sleep (since owing to his words a fire was raging in our hearts), we came forth from the cell and retired about a hundred yards from it and sat down in a secluded spot. And so as an opportunity was given by the shades of night for secret and familiar converse together, as we sat there Abbot Germanus groaned heavily.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>Of the anxiety of Abbot Germanus at the recollection of our promise.</strong></p>

<p>What are we doing? Said he. For we see that we are involved in a great difficulty and are in an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> plight, as reason itself and the life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is effectually teaching us what is the best thing for our progress in the spiritual life, and yet our promise given to the Elders does not allow us to choose what is helpful. For we might, by the examples of such great men, be formed for a more perfect life and aim, were it not that the terms of our promise compelled us to return at once to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. But if we return there, we shall never get another chance of coming here again. But if we stay here and choose to carry out our wishes, what becomes of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which we are aware that we gave to our Elders promising a speedy return; that we might be allowed to make a hasty round of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of this province? And when in this state of tumult we could not make up our minds what we ought to decide on the state of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> we simply testified by our groans the hard <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of our condition, upbraiding the audacity of our impudence, and yet hating the shame which was natural to us, weighed down by which we could not in any other way resist the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of those who kept us back against our profit and purpose, except by the promise of a speedy return, as we wept indeed that we laboured under the fault of that shame, of which it is said <q>There is a shame that brings <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352013"><a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse11">Proverbs&nbsp;26:11</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>My ideas on this subject.</strong></p>

<p>Then I replied: The counsel or rather the authority of the Elder to whom we ought to refer our anxieties would make a short way out of our difficulties, and whatever is decided by his verdict, may, like a divine and heavenly reply, put an end to all our troubles. And we need not have any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of what is given to us by the Lord through the lips of this Elder, both for the sake of his merits and for our own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For by His gift <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> have often obtained saving counsel from unworthy people, and unbelievers from <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as the Lord grants this either on account of the merit of those who answer, or on account of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those who ask advice. And so the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Abbot Germanus caught eagerly at these words as if I had uttered them not of myself but at the prompting of the Lord, and when we had waited a little for the coming of the Elder and the approaching hour of the nocturnal service, after we had welcomed him with the usual greeting and finished reciting the right number of Psalms and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, we sat down again as usual on the same mats on which we had settled ourselves to sleep.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>Abbot Joseph's question and our answer on the origin of our anxiety.</strong></p>

<p>Then the venerable Joseph saw that we were in rather low spirits, and, guessing that this was not the case without reason, addressed us in these words of the patriarch Joseph: <q>Why are your faces sad today?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352014"><a href="../bible/gen040.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;40:7</a></span> to whom we answered: We are not like those bond slaves of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> who have seen a dream and there is none to interpret it, but I admit that we have passed a sleepless night and there is no one to lighten the weight of our troubles unless the Lord may remove them by your wisdom. Then he, who recalled the excellence of the patriarch both by his merits and name, said: Does not the cure of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perplexities come from the Lord? Let them be brought forward: for the Divine Compassion is able to give a remedy for them by means of our advice according to your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>The explanation of Abbot Germanus why we wanted to stay in Egypt, and were drawn back to Syria.</strong></p>

<p>To this Germanus: We used to think, said he, that we should go back to our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> abundantly filled not only with spiritual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> but also with what is profitable by the sight of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and that after our return we should follow, though with but a feeble rivalry, what we had learned from your teaching. For this our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for our Elders led us to promise them, while we fancied that we could in some degree follow in that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> your sublime life and doctrine. Wherefore as we thought that by this means all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> would be bestowed upon us, so on the other hand we are overwhelmed with intolerable grief, as we find that we cannot possibly obtain in this way what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be good for us. On both sides then we are now hemmed in. For if we want to keep our promise which we made in the presence of all the brethren in the cave where our Lord Himself shone forth from His chamber in the Virgin's womb,  and which He Himself witnessed, we shall incur the greatest loss in our spiritual life. But if we ignore our promise and stay in this district, and choose to consider that <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of ours as of less importance than our perfection, we are afraid of the awful dangers of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> and <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>. But not even by this plan can we lighten our burdens; viz., by fulfilling the terms of our <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by a very hasty return, and then coming back again as quickly as possible to these parts. For although even a small delay is dangerous and hurtful for those who are aiming at goodness and advance in spiritual things, yet still we would keep our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and promise, though by an unwilling return, were it not that we felt sure that we should be so tightly bound down both by the authority and also by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Elders, that we should henceforth have no opportunity at all to come back again to this place.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>Abbot Joseph's question whether we got more good in Egypt than in Syria.</strong></p>

<p>To this the blessed Joseph, after a short silence: Are you sure, said he, that you can get more profit in spiritual matters in this country?</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>The answer on the difference of customs in the two countries.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: Although we ought to be <em>most</em> grateful for the teaching of those men who taught us from our youth up to attempt great things, and, by giving us a taste of their excellence, implanted in our hearts a splendid thirst for perfection, yet if any reliance is to be placed on our judgment, we cannot draw any comparison between these customs and those which we learned there, so as to hold our tongues about the inimitable purity of your life, which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is granted to you not only owing to the concentration of your mind and aim, but also owing to the aid and assistance of the place itself. Wherefore we do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that for the following of your grand perfection this instruction which is given to us is not enough by itself, unless we have also the help of the life, and a long course of instruction somewhat dissolves the coldness of our heart by daily training.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>How those who are perfect ought not to make any promises absolutely, and whether decisions can be reversed without sin.</strong></p>

<p>Joseph: It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> indeed and right and altogether in accordance with our profession, for us effectually to perform what we decided to do in the case of any promise. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> ought not to make any promise hastily, lest he may be forced to do what he incautiously promised, or if he is kept back by consideration of a sounder view, appear as a breaker of his promise. But because at the present moment our purpose is to treat not so much of a state of health as of the cure of sickness we must with salutary counsel consider not what you ought to have done in the first instance, but how you can escape from the rocks of this perilous shipwreck. When then no chains impede us and no conditions restrict us, in the case of a comparison of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, if a choice is proposed, that which is most advantageous should be preferred: but when some detriment and loss stands in the way, in a comparison of things to our hurt, that should be sought which exposes us to the smallest loss. Further, as your assertion shows, when your heedless promise has brought you to this state that in either case some serious loss and inconvenience must result to you, the will in choosing should incline to that side which involves a loss that is more tolerable, or can be more easily made up for by the remedy of making amends. If then you think that you will get more good for your spirit by staying here than what accrued to you from your life in that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and that the terms of your promise cannot be fulfilled without the loss of great good, it is better for you to undergo the loss from a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> and an unfulfilled promise (as it is done once for all, and need not any longer be repeated or be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>) than for you to incur that loss, through which you say that your state of life would become colder, and which would affect you with a daily and unceasing injury. For a careless promise is changed in such a way that it may be pardoned or indeed praised, if it is turned into a better path, nor need we take it as a failure in consistency, but as a correction of rashness, whenever a promise that was faulty is corrected. And all this may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by most certain <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> from Scripture, that for many the fulfilment of their promise has led to death, and on the other hand that for many it has been good and profitable to have refused it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>How it is often better to break one's engagements than to fulfil them.</strong></p>

<p>And both these points are very clearly shown by the cases of S. Peter the Apostle and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>. For the former, because he departed from his expressed determination which he had as it were confirmed with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> saying <q>You shall never wash my feet,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352016"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;13:8</a></span> gained an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> partnership with Christ, whereas he would certainly have been cut off from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of this blessedness, if he had clung obstinately to his word. But the latter, by clinging to the pledge of his ill-considered <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, became the bloody murderer of the Lord's forerunner, and through the vain <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> plunged himself into condemnation and the punishment of everlasting death. In everything then we must consider the end, and must according to it direct our course and aim, and if when some wiser counsel supervenes, we see it diverging to the worse part, it is better to discard the unsuitable arrangement, and to come to a better mind rather than to cling obstinately to our engagements and so become involved in worse <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>Our question about our fear of the oath which we gave in the monastery in Syria.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: In so far as it concerns our desire, which we undertook to carry out for the sake of spiritual profit, we were hoping to be edified by continual intercourse with you. For if we were to return to our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> it is certain that we should not only fail of so sublime a purpose, but that we should also suffer grievous loss from the mediocrity of the manner of life there. But that command of the gospel frightens us terribly: <q>Let your speech be yea, yea, nay, nay: but whatsoever is more than these, is from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352017"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;5:37</a></span> For we hold that we cannot compensate for transgressing so important a command by any righteousness, nor can that finally turn out well which has once been started with a bad beginning.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>The answer that we must take into account the purpose of the doer rather than the execution of the business.</strong></p>

<p>Joseph: In every case, as we said, we must look not at the progress of the work but at the intention of the worker, nor must we inquire to begin with what a man has done, but with what purpose, so that we may find that some have been condemned for those <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> from which good has afterwards arisen, and on the other hand that some have arrived by means of acts in themselves reprehensible at the height of righteousness. And in the case of the former the good result of their actions was of no avail to them as they took the matter in and with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> purpose, and wanted to bring about&mdash; not the good which actually resulted, but something of the opposite character; nor was the bad beginning injurious to the latter, as he put up with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of a blameworthy start; not out of disregard for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or with the purpose of doing wrong, but with an eye to a needful and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> end.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>How a fortunate issue will be of no avail to evil doers, while bad deeds will not injure good men.</strong></p>

<p>And that we may make these statements clear by instances from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, what could be brought about that was more salutary and more to the good of the whole world, than the saving remedy of the Lord's Passion? And yet it was not only of no advantage, but was actually to the disadvantage of the traitor by whose means it is shown to have been brought about, so that it is absolutely said of him: <q>It were good for that man if he had never been born.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352018"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;26:24</a></span> For the fruits of his labour will not be repaid to him according to the actual result, but according to what he wanted to do, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that he would accomplish. And again, what could there be more culpable than craft and deceit shown even to a stranger, not to mention one's brother and father? And yet the patriarch Jacob not only met with no condemnation or blame for such things but was actually dowered with the everlasting heritage of the blessing. And not without reason, for the last mentioned desired the blessing destined for the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> not out of a greedy desire for present gain but because of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in everlasting sanctification; while the former (Judas) delivered the Redeemer of all to death, not for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. And therefore in each case the fruits of their action are reckoned according to the intention of the mind and purpose of the will, according to which the object of the one was not to work fraud, nor was that of the other to work <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> is there repayment to each man as the recompense of reward, for what he conceived in the first instance in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and not for what resulted from it either well or badly, against the wish of the worker. And so the most just Judge regarded him who ventured on such a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> as excusable and indeed worthy of praise, because without it he could not secure the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>; and that should not be reckoned as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which arose from desire of the blessing. Otherwise the aforesaid patriarch would have been not only unfair to his brother, but also a cheat of his father and a blasphemer, if there had been any other way by which he could secure the gift of that blessing, and he had preferred to follow this which would damage and injure his brother. You see then that with God the inquiry is not into the carrying out of the act, but into the purpose of the mind. With this preparation then for a return to the question proposed (for which all this has been premised) I want you first to tell me for what reason you bound yourselves in the fetters of that promise.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><strong>Our answer as to the reason which demanded an oath from us.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: The first reason, as we said, was that we were afraid of vexing our Elders and resisting their orders; the second was that we very foolishly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that, if we had learned from you anything perfect or splendid to hear or look at, when we returned to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, we should be able to perform it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>The discourse of the Elder showing how the plan of action may be changed without fault provided that one keeps to the carrying out of a good intention.</strong></p>

<p>Joseph: As we premised, the intent of the mind brings a man either reward or condemnation, according to this passage: <q>Their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men;</q> and this too: <q>But I am coming to gather together their works and thoughts together with all nations and tongues.</q>  Wherefore it was, as I see, from a desire for perfection that you bound yourselves with the chain of these oaths, as you then thought that by this plan it could be gained, while now that a riper judgment has supervened, you see that you cannot by this means scale its heights. And so any departure from that arrangement, which may seem to have happened, will be no hindrance, if only no change in that first purpose follows. For a change of instrument does not imply a desertion of the work, nor does the choice of a shorter and more direct road argue laziness on the path of the traveller. And so in this matter an improvement in a short-sighted arrangement is not to be reckoned a breach of a spiritual promise. For whatever is done out of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and desire for goodness, which has <q>promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352020"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:8</a></span> even though it may appear to commence with a hard and adverse beginning, is most worthy, not only of no blame, but actually of praise. And therefore the breaking of a careless promise will be no hindrance, if in every case the end, i.e., the proposed aim at goodness, be maintained. For we do all for this reason, that we may be able to show to God a clean heart, and if the attainment of this is considered to be easier in this country the alteration of the agreement extracted from you will be no hindrance to you, if only the perfection of that purity for the sake of which your promise was originally made, be the sooner secured according to the Lord's will.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>A question whether it can be without sin that our knowledge affords to weak brethren an opportunity for lying.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: As far as the force of the words which have been reasonably and carefully considered, is concerned, our scruple about our promise would have easily been removed from us were it not that we were terribly alarmed lest by this example an opportunity for lying might be offered to certain weaker brethren, if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of an agreement could be in any way lawfully broken, whereas this very thing is forbidden in such vigorous and threatening terms by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> when he says: <q>You shall destroy all those who utter a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>;</q> and: <q>the mouth that speaks a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, shall slay the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>The answer that Scripture truth is not to be altered on account of an offense given to the weak.</strong></p>

<p>Joseph: Occasions and opportunities for destroying themselves cannot possibly be wanting to those who are on the road to ruin, or rather who are anxious to destroy themselves; nor are those passages of Scripture to be rejected and altogether torn out of the volume, by which the perversity of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is encouraged, or the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> increased, or the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> wisdom offended; but surely they are to be piously <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and firmly held, and preached according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And therefore we should not, because of another's unbelief, reject the <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F30;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>, i.e., the <q>economy</q> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> which Scripture relates, lest while we are thinking that we ought to condescend to their infirmities, we stain ourselves with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not only of lying but of sacrilege. But, as we said, we ought to admit these according to the letter, and explain how they were rightly done. But for those who are wrongly disposed, the opening for lies will not be blocked up by this means, if we are trying either altogether to deny or to explain away by allegorical interpretations the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of those things which we are going to bring forward or have already brought forward. For how will the authority of these passages injure them if their corrupt will is alone sufficient to lead them to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p><strong>How the saints have profitably employed a lie like hellebore.</strong></p>

<p>And so we ought to regard a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> and to employ it as if its nature were that of hellebore; which is useful if taken when some deadly disease is threatening, but if taken without being required by some great danger is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of immediate death. For so also we read that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men and those most approved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> employed lying, so as not only to incur no guilt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from it, but even to attain the greatest goodness; and if deceit could confer <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on them, what on the other hand would the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have brought them but condemnation? Just as Rahab, of whom Scripture gives a record not only of no good deed but actually of unchastity, yet simply for the lie, by means of which she preferred to hide the spies instead of betraying them, had it vouchsafed to her to be joined with the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in everlasting blessing. But if she had preferred to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and to regard the safety of the citizens, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that she and all her house would not have escaped the coming destruction, nor would it have been vouchsafed to her to be inserted in the progenitors of our Lord's nativity, <span class="stiki" id="note352022"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;1:5</a></span> and reckoned in the list of the patriarchs, and through her descendants that followed, to become the mother of the Saviour of all. Again Dalila, who to provide for the safety of her fellow citizens betrayed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> she had discovered, obtained in exchange <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> destruction, and has left to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> nothing but the memory of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. When then any grave danger hangs on confession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, then we must take to lying as a refuge, yet in such a way as to be for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> troubled by the guilt of a humbled <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. But where there is no call of the utmost necessity present, there a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> should be most carefully avoided as if it were something deadly: just as we said of a cup of hellebore which is indeed useful if it is only taken in the last resort when a deadly and inevitable disease is threatening, while if it is taken when the body is in a state of sound and rude health, its deadly properties at once go to find out the vital parts. And this was clearly shown of Rahab of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, and the patriarch Jacob; the former of whom could only escape death by means of this remedy, while the latter could not secure the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> without it. For God is not only the Judge and inspector of our words and actions, but He also looks into their purpose and aim. And if He sees that anything has been done or promised by some one for the sake of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and shows insight into Divine <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, even though it may appear to men to be hard and unfair, yet He looks at the inner goodness of the heart and regards the desire of the will rather than the actual words spoken, because He must take into account the aim of the work and the disposition of the doer, whereby, as was said above, one man may be justified by means of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, while another may be guilty of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of everlasting death by telling the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. To which end the patriarch Jacob also had regard when he was not afraid to imitate the hairy appearance of his brother's body by wrapping himself up in skins, and to his credit acquiesced in his mother's instigation of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> for this object. For he saw that in this way there would be bestowed on him greater gains of blessing and righteousness than by keeping to the path of simplicity: for he did not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the stain of this lie would at once be washed away by the flood of the paternal blessing, and would speedily be dissolved like a little cloud by the breath of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and that richer rewards of merit would be bestowed on him by means of this dissimulation which he put on than by means of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which was natural to him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p><strong>An objection that only those men employed lies with impunity, who lived under the law.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: It is no wonder that these schemes were properly employed in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and that some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men laudably or at any rate venially told lies, as we see that many worse things were permitted to them owing to the rude character of the times. For why should we wonder that when the blessed David was fleeing from Saul, in answer to the inquiry of Abimelech the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who said: <q>Why are you alone, and is no man with you?</q> he replied as follows: <q>The king has commanded me a business, and said, Let no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the thing for which you are sent by me, for I have appointed my servants to such and such a place;</q> and again: <q>Have you here at hand a spear or a sword, for I brought not my own sword nor my own weapon with me, for the king's business required haste;</q> or this, when he was brought to Achish king of Gath, and feigned himself mad and frantic, <q>and changed his countenance before them, and slipped down between their hands; and stumbled against the doors of the gate and his spittle ran down on his beard;</q>  when they were even allowed to enjoy crowds of wives and concubines, and no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was on this account imputed to them, and when moreover they often shed the blood of their enemies with their own hand, and this was thought not only worthy of no blame, but actually praiseworthy? And all these things we see by the light of the gospel are utterly forbidden, so that not one of them can be done without great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and guilt. And in the same way we hold that no lie can be employed by any one, I will not say rightly, but not even venially, however it may be covered with the colour of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, as the Lord says: <q>Let your speech be yea, yea, nay, nay: but whatsoever is more than these is of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one;</q> and the Apostle also agrees with this: <q>And lie not one to another.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p><strong>The answer, that leave to lie, which was not even granted under the old Covenant, has rightly been taken by many.</strong></p>

<p>Joseph: All liberty in the matter of wives and many concubines, as the end of time is approaching and the multiplying of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> completed, ought rightly to be cut off by evangelical perfection, as being no longer necessary. For up to the coming of Christ it was well that the blessing of the original sentence should be in full vigour, whereby it was said: <q>Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352025"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> And therefore it was quite right that from the root of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fecundity which happily flourished in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, in accordance with that dispensation of the times, the buds of angelical <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> should spring, and the fragrant flowers of continence be produced in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But that lying was even then condemned the text of the whole <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> clearly shows, as it says: <q>You shall destroy all them that speak lies;</q> and again: <q>The bread of lying is sweet to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel;</q> and the Giver of the law himself says: <q>You shall avoid a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>.</q>  But we said that it was then properly employed as a last resort when some need or plan of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was linked on to it, on account of which it ought not to be condemned. As is the case, which you mentioned, of king David when in his flight from the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Saul, to Abimelech the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he used <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> words, not with the object of getting any gain nor with the desire to injure anybody, but simply to save himself from that most iniquitous <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; inasmuch as he would not stain his hands with the blood of the hostile king, so often delivered up to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as he said: <q>The Lord be merciful to me that I may do no such thing to my master the Lord's anointed, as to lay my hand upon him, because he is the Lord's anointed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352027"><a href="../bible/1sa024.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;24:7</a></span> And therefore these plans which we hear that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men under the old covenant adopted either from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or for the prefiguring of spiritual <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> or for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of some people, we too cannot refuse altogether, when necessity constrains us, as we see that even <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did not avoid them, where the consideration of something profitable required them: which in the meanwhile we will for a time postpone, while we first discuss those instances which we propose still to bring forward from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and afterwards we shall more suitably introduce them so as more readily to prove that good and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, both in the Old and in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, were entirely at one with each other in these contrivances. For what shall we say of that <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> fraud of Hushai to Absalom for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of king David, which though uttered with all appearance of good-will by the deceiver and cheat, and opposed to the good of him who asked advice, is yet commended by the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, which says: <q>But by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord the profitable counsel of Ahithophel was defeated that the Lord might bring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon Absalom?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352028"><a href="../bible/2sa017.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;17:14</a></span> Nor could that be blamed which was done for the right side with a right purpose and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> intent, and was planned for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and victory of one whose <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> dissimulation. What too shall we say of the deed of that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who received the men who had been sent to king David by the aforesaid Hushai, and hid them in a well, and spread a cloth over its mouth, and pretended that she was drying pearl-barley, and said <q>They passed on after tasting a little water</q>;  and by this invention saved them from the hands of their pursuers? Wherefore answer me, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, and say what you would have done, if any similar situation had arisen for you, living now under the gospel; would you prefer to hide them with a similar <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, saying in the same way: <q>They passed on after tasting a little water,</q> and thus fulfil the command: <q>Deliver those who are being led to death, and spare not to redeem those who are being killed;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352030"><a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse11">Proverbs&nbsp;24:11</a></span> or by speaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, would you have given up those in hiding to the men who would kill them? And what then becomes of the Apostle's words: <q>Let no man seek his own but the things of another:</q> and: <q>Love seeks not her own, but the things of others;</q> and of himself he says: <q>I seek not my own good but the good of many that they may be saved?</q>  For if we seek our own, and want obstinately to keep what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for ourselves, we must even in urgent cases of this sort speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and so become guilty of the death of another: but if we prefer what is for another's advantage to our own good, and satisfy the demands of the Apostle, we shall certainly have to put up with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of lying. And therefore we shall not be able to keep a perfect heart of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, or to seek, as Apostolic perfection requires, the things of others, unless we relax a little in those things which concern the strictness and perfection of our own lives, and choose to condescend with ready affection to what is useful to others, and so with the Apostle become weak to the weak, that we may be able to gain the weak.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p><strong>How even Apostles thought that a lie was often useful and the truth injurious.</strong></p>

<p>Instructed by which examples, the blessed Apostle James also, and all the chief princes of the primitive Church urged the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> in consequence of the weakness of feeble <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to condescend to a fictitious arrangement and insisted on his purifying himself according to the requirements of the law, and shaving his head and paying his vows, as they thought that the present harm which would come from this hypocrisy was of no account, but had regard rather to the gain which would result from his still continued preaching. For the gain to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> from his strictness would not have counterbalanced the loss to all nations from his speedy death. And this would certainly have been then incurred by the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> unless this good and salutary hypocrisy had preserved him for the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For then we may rightly and pardonably acquiesce in the wrong of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, when, as we said, a greater harm depends on telling the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and when the good which results to us from speaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> cannot counterbalance the harm which will be caused by it. And elsewhere the blessed Apostle testifies in other words that he himself always observed this disposition; for when he says: <q>To the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> I became as a Jew that I might gain the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; to those who were under the law as being under the law, though not myself under the law, that I might gain those who were under the law; to those who were without law, I became as without law, though I was not without the law of God but under the law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that I might gain those who were without law; to the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that I might save all;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352032"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:20-22</a></span> what does he show but that according to the weakness and the capacity of those who were being instructed he always lowered himself and relaxed something of the vigour of perfection, and did not cling to what his own strict life might seem to demand, but rather preferred that which the good of the weak might require? And that we may trace these matters out more carefully and recount one by one the glories of the good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the Apostles, some one may ask how the blessed Apostle can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have suited himself to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in all things. When did he to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> become as a Jew? Certainly in the case where, while he still kept in his inmost heart the opinion which he had maintained to the Galatians saying: <q>Behold, I, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, say unto you that if you be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Christ shall profit you nothing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352033"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse2">Galatians&nbsp;5:2</a></span> yet by circumcising Timothy he adopted a shadow as it were of Jewish <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. And again, where did he become to those under the law, as under the law? There certainly where James and all the Elders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, fearing lest he might be attacked by the multitude of Jewish <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, or rather of Judaizing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who had received the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Christ in such a way as still to be bound by the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of legal ceremonies, came to his rescue in his difficulty with this counsel and advice, and said: <q>You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and they are all zealots for the law. But they have heard of you that you teach those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who are among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to depart from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children;</q> and below: <q>Do therefore this that we say unto you: we have four men who have a vow on them. These take and sanctify yourself with them and bestow on them, that they may shave their heads; and all will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the things which they have heard of you are false, but that you yourself also walkest keeping the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352034"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse20">Acts&nbsp;21:20-24</a></span> And so for the good of those who were under the law, he trode under foot for a while the strict view which he had expressed: <q>For I through the law am dead unto the law that I may live unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352035"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;2:19</a></span> and was driven to shave his head, and be purified according to the law and pay his vows after the Mosaic <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> in the Temple. Do you ask also where for the good of those who were utterly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he himself became as if without law? Read the introduction to his sermon at Athens where <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> was flourishing: <q>As I passed by,</q> he says, <q>I saw your <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and an altar on which was written: To the unknown <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and when he had thus started from their <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, as if he himself also had been without law, under the cloke of that profane inscription he introduced the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, saying: <q>What therefore you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> worship, that declare I unto you.</q> And after a little, as if he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> nothing whatever of the Divine law, he chose to bring forward a verse of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> poet rather than a saying of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> or Christ, saying: <q>As some also of your own poets have said: for we are also His offspring.</q> And when he had thus approached them with their own authorities, which they could not reject, thus confirming the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by things false, he added and said: <q>Since then we are the offspring of God we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold or silver or stone sculptured by the art and device of man.</q>  But to the weak he became weak, when, by way of permission, not of command, he allowed those who could not contain themselves to return together again, <span class="stiki" id="note352037"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:5</a></span> or when he fed the Corinthians with milk and not with meat, and says that he was with them in weakness and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and much trembling.  But he became all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that he might save all, when he says: <q>He that eats let him not despise him that eats not, and let not him that eats not judge him that eats:</q> and: <q>He that gives his virgin in marriage does well, and he that gives her not in marriage does better;</q> and elsewhere: <q>Who,</q> says he, <q>is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?</q> and in this way he fulfilled what he had commanded the Corinthians to do when he said: <q>Be without offense to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as I also please all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in all things, not seeking my own profit but that of the many, that they may be saved.</q>  For it had certainly been profitable not to circumcise Timothy, not to shave his head, not to undergo Jewish purification, not to practice going barefoot,  not to pay legal vows; but he did all these things because he did not seek his own profit but that of the many. And although this was done with the full consideration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet it was not free from dissimulation. For one who through the law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was dead to the law that he might live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who had made and treated that righteousness of the law in which he had lived blameless, as dung, that he might gain Christ, could not with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fervour of heart offer what belonged to the law; nor is it right to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he who had said: <q>For if I again rebuild what I have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352041"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse18">Galatians&nbsp;2:18</a></span> would himself fall into what he had condemned. And to such an extent is account taken, not so much of the actual thing which is done as of the disposition of the doer, that on the other hand <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is sometimes found to have injured some, and a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> to have done them good. For when Saul was grumbling to his servants about David's flight, and saying: <q>Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards, and make you all tribunes and centurions: that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one to inform me,</q> did Doeg the Edomite say anything but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when he told him: <q>I saw the son of Jesse in Nob, with Abimelech the son of Ahitub the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him also the sword of Goliath the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>?</q>  For which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> story he deserved to be rooted up out of the land of the living, and it is said of him by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Wherefore God shall destroy you forever, and pluck you up and tear you out of your tabernacle, and your root from the land of the living:</q>  He then for showing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is forever plucked and rooted up out of that land in which the harlot Rahab with her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is planted for her lie: just as also we remember that Samson most injuriously betrayed to his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> wife the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which he had hidden for a long time by a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, and therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> so inconsiderately disclosed was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his own deception, because he had neglected to keep the command of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Keep the doors of your mouth from her that sleeps in your bosom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352044"><a href="../bible/mic002.htm#verse7">Micah&nbsp;2:7</a></span> </p>

<p><strong>Whether secret abstinence ought to be made known, without telling a lie about it, to those who ask, and whether what has once been declined may be taken in hand.</strong></p>

If we conceal it, to satisfy the Lord's command which says: <q>You shall not appear unto men to fast but unto your Father Who is in secret;</q> and again: <q>Let not your left hand <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what your right hand does,</q>  we must at once tell a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>. If we make manifest the good act of abstinence, the word of the gospel rightly discourages us: <q>Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</q>  But what if any one has refused with determination a cup offered to him by some brother, denying altogether that he will take what the other, rejoicing at his arrival, begs and intreats him to receive? Is it right that he should force himself to yield to his brother who goes on his knees and bows himself to the ground, and who thinks that he can only show his loving heart by this service, or should he obstinately cling to his own word and intention?</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p><strong>An objection, that abstinence ought to be concealed, but that things that have been declined should not be received.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: In the former instance we think there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it is better for our abstinence to be hidden than for it to be displayed to the inquirers, and in cases of this sort we also admit that a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> is unavoidable. But in the second there is no need for us to tell a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, first because we can refuse what is offered by the service of a brother in such a way as to bind ourselves in no bond of determination, and next because when we once refuse we can keep our opinion unchanged.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p><strong>The answer that obstinacy in this decision is unreasonable.</strong></p>

<p>Joseph: There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that these are the decisions of those <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in which the infancy of your renunciation was, as you tell us, trained, as their leaders are accustomed to prefer their own will to their brother's supper, and most obstinately stick to what they have once intended. But our Elders, to whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the signs of Apostolical powers have borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and who have treated everything with judgment and discretion of spirit rather than with stiff obstinacy of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, have laid down that those men who give in to the infirmities of others, receive much richer fruits than those who persist in their determinations, and have declared that it is a better deed to conceal abstinence, as was said, by this needful and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> lie, rather than to display it with a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> show of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p><strong>How Abbot Piamun chose to hide his abstinence.</strong></p>

<p>Finally Abbot Piamun  after twenty-five years did not hesitate to receive some grapes and wine offered to him by a certain brother, and at once preferred, against his rule, to taste what was brought him rather than to display his abstinence which was a secret from everybody. For if we would also bear in mind what we remember that our Elders always did, who used to conceal the marvels of their own good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and their own acts, which they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to bring forward in Conference for the instruction of the juniors, under cover of other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, what else can we consider them but an open lie? And O that we too had anything worthy which we could bring forward for stirring up the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the juniors! Certainly we should have no scruples in following their fictions of that kind. For it is better under the colour of a figure like that to tell a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> than for the sake of maintaining that unreasonable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a> either hide in ill-advised silence what might be edifying to the hearers, or run into the display of an objectionable vanity by telling them <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfully</a> in our own character. And the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> clearly teaches us the same lesson by his teaching, as he chose to bring forward the great revelations made to him, under the character of some one else, saying: <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a man in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell, God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, caught up even unto the third heaven: and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for man to utter.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352048"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:2-4</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p><strong>The evidence of Scripture on changes of determination.</strong></p>

<p>It is impossible for us briefly to run through everything. For who could count up almost all the patriarchs and numberless <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, some of whom for the preservation of life, others out of desire for a blessing, others out of pity, others to conceal some secret, others out of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, others in searching for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, became, so to speak, patrons of lying? And as all cannot be enumerated, so all ought not to be altogether passed over. For <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> forced the blessed Joseph to raise a false charge against his brethren even with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by the life of the king, saying: <q>You are spies: to see the nakedness of the land are you come;</q> and below: <q>send,</q> says he, <q>one of you, and bring your brothers hither: but you shall be kept here until your words are made manifest whether you speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or no: but if not, by the life of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, you are spies.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352049"><a href="../bible/gen042.htm#verse9">Genesis&nbsp;42:9,&nbsp;16</a></span> For if he had not out of pity alarmed them by this lie, he would not have been able to see again his father and his brother, nor to preserve them in their great danger of starvation, nor to free the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of his brethren from the guilt of selling him. The act then of striking his brethren with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> by means of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> was not so reprehensible as was it a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and laudable act to urge his enemies and seekers to a salutary penitence by means of a feigned danger. Finally when they were weighed down by the odium of the very serious accusation, they were conscience-stricken not at the charge <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> raised against them, but at the thought of their earlier crime, and said to one another: <q>We suffer this rightly because we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when he asked us and we did not hearken to him: wherefore all this trouble has come upon us.</q>  And this confession, we think, expiated by most salutary humility their terrible <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not only against their brother, against whom they had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> cruelty, but also against God. What about Solomon, who in his first judgment manifested the gift of wisdom, which he had received of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, only by making use of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>? For in order to get at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which was hidden by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> lie, even he used the help of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> most cunningly invented, saying: <q>Bring me a sword and divide the living child into two parts, and give the one half to the one and the other half to the other.</q> And when this pretended cruelty stirred the heart of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> mother, but was received with approval by her who was not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> mother, then at last by this most sagacious discovery of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he pronounced the judgment which every one has felt to have been inspired by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: <q>Give her the living child and slay it not: she is the mother of it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352051"><a href="../bible/1ki003.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;3:24-27</a></span> Further we are more fully taught by other passages of Scripture as well that we neither can nor should carry out everything which we determine either with peace or disturbance of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as we often hear that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and even <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> Himself have changed what they had decided upon. For the blessed David determined and confirmed it by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, saying: <q>May God do so and add more to the foes of David if I leave of all that belong unto Nabal until the morning a single male.</q> And presently when Abigail his wife interceded and intreated for him, he gave up his threats, lightened the sentence, and preferred to be regarded as a breaker of his word rather than to keep his pledged <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by cruelly executing it, saying: <q>As the Lord lives, if you had not quickly come to meet me there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light a single male.</q>  And as we do not hold that his readiness to take a rash <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> (which resulted from his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and disturbance of mind) ought to be copied by us, so we do think that the pardon and revision of his determination is to be followed. The <q>chosen vessel,</q> in writing to the Corinthians, promises unconditionally to return, saying: <q>But I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia: for I will pass through Macedonia. But I will stay or even pass the winter with you that you may conduct me wherever I shall go. For I do not want only to see you in passing: for I hope to stay with you for some time.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352053"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;16:5,&nbsp;7</a></span> And this fact he remembers in the Second Epistle, thus: <q>And in this confidence I was minded first to come unto you, that you might receive a second favour, and by you to pass into Macedonia and again to come to you from Macedonia and by you be conducted to Jud&aelig;a.</q> But a better plan suggested itself and he plainly admits that he is not going to fulfil what he had promised. <q>When then,</q> says he, <q>I purposed this, did I use light-mindedness? Or the things that I think, do I think after the flesh, that there should be with me yea, yea, and nay, nay?</q> Lastly, he declares even with the affirmation of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, why it was that he preferred to put on one side his pledged word rather than by his presence to bring a burden and grief to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>But I call God to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that it was to spare you that I came not as far as <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. For I determined this with myself that I would not come unto you in sorrow.</q>  Though when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> had refused to enter the house of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> at <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, saying to him: <q>We will not enter but will remain in the street,</q> they were presently forced by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to change their determination, as Scripture subjoins: <q>And <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> constrained them, and they turned in to him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352055"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;19:2-3</a></span> And certainly if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they would turn in to him, they refused his request with a sham excuse: but if their excuse was a real one, then they are clearly shown to have changed their mind. And certainly we hold that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> inserted this in the sacred volume for no other reason but to teach us by their examples that we ought not to cling obstinately to our own determinations, but to subject them to our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and so to keep our judgment free from all the chains of law that it may be ready to follow the call of good counsel in any direction, and may not delay or refuse to pass without any delay to whatever a sound discretion may find to be the better choice. And to rise to still higher instances, when king Hezekiah was lying on his bed and afflicted with grievous sickness the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah addressed him in the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said: <q>Thus says the Lord: set your house in order for you shall die and not live. And Hezekiah,</q> it says, <q>turned his face to the wall and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the Lord and said: I beseech you, O Lord, remember how I have walked before You in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and with a perfect heart, and how I have done what was right in Your sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</q> After which it was again said to him: <q>Go, return, and speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Thus says the Lord God of David your father: I have heard your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, I have seen your tears: and behold, I will add to your days fifteen years: and I will deliver you out of the hand of the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and I will defend this city for your sake and for my servant David's sake.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352056"><a href="../bible/2ki020.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;20:1-6</a></span> What can be clearer than this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that out of consideration for mercy and goodness the Lord would rather break His word and instead of the pre-arranged limit of death extend the life of him who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, for fifteen years, rather than be found inexorable because of His unchangeable decree? In the same way too the Divine sentence says to the men of Nineveh: <q>Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown;</q>  and presently this stern and abrupt sentence is softened by their penitence and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and is turned to the side of mercy with goodness that is easy to be intreated. But if any one maintains that the Lord had threatened the destruction of their city (while He foreknew that they would be converted) for this reason, that He might incite them to a salutary penitence, it follows that those who are set over their brethren may, if need arises, without any blame for telling lies, threaten those who need improvement with severer treatment than they are really going to inflict. But if one says that God revoked that severe sentence in consideration of their penitence, according to what he says by Ezekiel: <q>If I say to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, You shall surely die: and he becomes penitent for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and does judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, he shall surely live, he shall not die;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352058"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse14">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:14-15</a></span> we are similarly taught that we ought not obstinately to stick to our determination, but that we should with gentle pity soften down the threats which necessity called forth. And that we may not fancy that the Lord granted this specially to the Ninevites, He continually affirms by Jeremiah that He will do the same in general towards all, and promises that without delay He will change His sentence in accordance with our deserts; saying: <q>I will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom to root out and to pull down and to destroy it. If that nation repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which I have spoken against it, I also will repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which I thought to do to them. And I will suddenly speak of a nation and a kingdom, to build up and to plant it. If it shall do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in My sight, that it <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> not My voice: I will repent of the good that I thought to do to it.</q> To Ezekiel also: <q>Leave out not a word, if so be they will hearken and be converted every one from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> way: that I may repent Me of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I thought to do to them for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of their doings.</q>  And by these passages it is declared that we ought not obstinately to stick to our decisions, but to modify them with reason and judgment, and that better courses should always be adopted and preferred, and that we should turn without any delay to that course which is considered the more profitable. For this above all that invaluable sentence teaches us, because though each man's end is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> beforehand to Him before his birth, yet somehow He so orders all things by a plan and method for all, and with regard to man's disposition, that He decides on everything not by the mere exercise of His power, nor according to the ineffable <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which His Prescience possesses, but according to the present actions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and rejects or draws to Himself each one, and daily either grants or withholds His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And that this is so the election of Saul also shows us, of whose miserable end the foreknowledge of God certainly could not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and yet He chose him out of so many thousands of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and anointed him king, rewarding the then existing merits of his life, and not considering the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of his coming fall, so that after he became reprobate, God complains almost in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> terms and, with man's feelings, as if He repented of his choice, saying: <q>It <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a> Me that I have appointed Saul king: for he has forsaken Me, and has not performed My words;</q> and again: <q>But Samuel was grieved for Saul because the Lord repented that He had made Saul king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  Finally this that He afterwards executed, that the Lord also declares by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ezekiel that He will by His daily judgment do with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, saying: <q>Yea, if I shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live, and he trusting in his righteousness commit iniquity: all his righteousness shall be forgotten, and in his iniquity which he has committed, in the same he shall die. And if I shall say to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: You shall surely die; and if he repent of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and do judgment and righteousness, and if that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man restore the pledge and render what he has <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a>, and walk in the commandments of life, and do no righteous thing, he shall surely live, he shall not die. None of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he has committed shall be imputed unto him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352061"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse13">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:13-16</a></span> Finally, when the Lord would for their speedy fall turn away His merciful countenance from the people, whom He had chosen out of all nations, the giver of the law interposes on their behalf and cries out: <q>I beseech You, O Lord, this people have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; they have made for themselves gods of gold; and now if You forgive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, forgive it; but if not, blot me out of Your book which You have written. To whom the Lord answered: If any man has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before Me, I will blot him out of My book.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352062"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse31">Exodus&nbsp;32:31-33</a></span> David also, when complaining in prophetic spirit of Judas and the Lord's persecutors, says: <q>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living;</q> and because they did not deserve to come to saving penitence because of the guilt of their great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he subjoins: <q>And let them not be written among the righteous.</q>  Finally in the case of Judas himself the meaning of the prophetic curse was clearly fulfilled, for when his deadly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was completed, he killed himself by hanging, that he might not after his name was blotted out be converted and repent and deserve to be once more written among the righteous in heaven. We must therefore not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that at the time when he was chosen by Christ and obtained a place in the Apostolate, the name of Judas was written in the book of the living, and that he heard as well as the rest the words: <q>Rejoice not because the devils are subject unto you, but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> because your names are written in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352064"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;10:20</a></span> But because he was corrupted by the plague of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> and had his name struck out from that heavenly list, it is suitably said of him and of men like him by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>O Lord, let all those that forsake You be confounded. Let them that depart from You be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters.</q> And elsewhere: <q>They shall not be in the counsel of My people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, neither shall they enter into the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p><strong>How saintly men cannot be hard and obstinate.</strong></p>

<p>Nor must we emit the value of that command because even if we have bound ourselves by some <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> under the influence of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or some other passion, (a thing which ought never to be done by a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>) still the case for each side should be weighed by a thorough judgment of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and the course on which we have determined should be compared to that which we are urged to adopt, and we should without hesitation adopt that which on the occurrence of sounder considerations is decided to be the best. For it is better to put our promise on one side than to undergo the loss of something good and more desirable. Finally we never remember that venerable and approved fathers were hard and unyielding in decisions of this sort, but as wax under the influence of heat, so they were modified by reason, and when sounder counsels prevailed, did not hesitate to give in to the better side. But those whom we have seen obstinately clinging to their determinations we have always set down as unreasonable and wanting in judgment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

<p><strong>A question whether the saying: <q>I have sworn and am purposed</q> is opposed to the view given above.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: So far as this consideration is concerned which has been clearly and fully treated of, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> ought never to determine anything for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest he turn out a breaker of his word or else obstinate. And what then can we make of this saying of the Psalmist: <q>I have <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> and am purposed to keep Your righteous judgments?</q>  What is <q>to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> and purpose</q> except to keep one's determinations fixedly?</p>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<p><strong>The answer telling in what cases the determination is to be kept fixedly, and in what cases it may be broken if need be.</strong></p>

<p>Joseph: We do not lay this down with regard to those fundamental commands, without which our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> cannot in any way exist, but with regard to those which we can either relax or hold fast to without endangering our state, as for instance, an unbroken and strict fast, or total abstinence from wine or oil, or entire prohibition to leave one's cell, or incessant attention to reading and meditation, all of which can be practised at pleasure, without damage to our profession and purpose, and, if need be, can be given up without blame. But we must most resolutely make up our minds to observe those fundamental commands, and not even, if need arise, to avoid death in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, with regard to which we must immovably assert: <q>I have <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> and am purposed.</q> And this should be done for the preservation of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for which all things else should be disregarded lest the beauty and perfection of its calm should suffer a stain. In the same way we must <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> for the purity of our <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and we ought to do the same for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and sobriety and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, to all of which we must cling with unchangeable persistence, and to forsake which even for a little is worthy of blame. But in the case of those bodily exercises, which are said to be profitable for a little, <span class="stiki" id="note352067"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:8</a></span> we must, as we said, decide in such a way that, if there occurs any more decided opportunity for a good act, which would lead us to relax them, we need not be bound by any rule about them, but may give them up and freely adopt what is more useful. For in the case of those bodily exercises, if they are dropped for a time, there is no danger: but to have given up these others even for a moment is deadly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>

<p><strong>How we ought to do those things which are to be kept secret.</strong></p>

<p>You must also provide with the same care that if by chance some word has slipped out of your mouth which you want to be a secret, no injunction to secrecy may trouble the hearer. For it will be more likely to be unheeded if it is let pass carelessly and simply, because the brother, whoever he is, will not be tormented with such a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to divulge it, as he will take it as something trivial dropped in casual conversation, and as what is for this very reason of less account, because it was not committed to the hearer's mind with a strict injunction to silence. For even if you bind his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by exacting an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> from him, you need not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it will very soon be divulged; for a fiercer assault of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power will be made upon him, both to annoy and betray you, and to make him break his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> as quickly as possible.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>

<p><strong>That no determination should be made on those things which concern the needs of the common life.</strong></p>

<p>And therefore a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> ought not hastily to make any promise on those things which merely concern bodily exercise, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest he may stir up the enemy still more to attack what he is keeping as it were under the observance of the law, and so he may be more readily compelled to break it. Since every one who lives under the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of liberty, and sets himself a law, thereby binds himself in a dangerous slavery, so that if by chance necessity constrains him to do what he might have ventured on lawfully, and indeed laudably and with thanksgiving, he is forced to act as a transgressor, and to fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: <q>for where there is no law there is no transgression.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352068"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;4:15</a></span> </p>

<p>By this instruction and the teaching of the blessed Joseph we were confirmed as by a Divine oracle and made up our minds to stop in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. But though henceforward we were but a little anxious about our promise, yet when seven years were over we were very glad to fulfil it. For we hastened to our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, at a time when we were confident of obtaining permission to return to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and first paid our respects properly to our Elders; next we revived the former <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in their minds as out of the ardour of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> they had not been at all softened by our very frequent letters to satisfy them, and in the last place, we entirely removed the sting of our broken promise and returned to the recesses of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Scete, as they themselves forwarded us with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</p>

<p>This learning and doctrine of the illustrious fathers, our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother, has to the best of its ability made plain to you. And if perhaps our clumsy style has confused it instead of setting it in order, I trust that the blame which our clumsiness deserves will not interfere with the praise due to these grand men. Since it seemed to us a safer course in the sight of our Judge to state even in unadorned style this splendid doctrine rather than to hold our tongues about it, since if he considers the grandeur of the thoughts, the fact that the awkwardness of our style annoys him, need not be prejudicial to the profit of the reader, and for our part we are more anxious about its usefulness than its being praised. This at least I charge all those into whose hand this little book may fall; viz., that they must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that whatever in it pleases them belongs to the fathers, and whatever they dislike is all our own. </p>
