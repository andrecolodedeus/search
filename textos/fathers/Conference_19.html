<h1>Conference 19</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>CONFERENCE OF ABBOT JOHN. ON THE AIM OF THE COENOBITE AND HERMIT.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>Of the C&oelig;nobium of Abbot Paul and the patience of a certain brother.</strong></p>

<p>After only a few days we made our way once more with great alacrity, drawn by the desire for further instruction, to the C&oelig;nobium of Abbot <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, where though a greater number than two hundred of the brethren dwell there, yet, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the festival which was then being held, an enormous collection of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from other C&oelig;nobia had come there as well: for the anniversary of the death  of a former Abbot who had presided over the same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was being solemnly kept. And we have mentioned this assembly for this reason that we may briefly treat of the patience of a certain brother, which was remarkable for immovable gentleness on his part in the presence of all this congregation. For though the object of this work has regard to another person; viz., that we may produce the utterances of Abbot John  who left the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> and submitted himself to that C&oelig;nobium with the utmost goodness and humility, yet we think it not at all absurd to relate without any unnecessary verbiage, what we think is most instructive to those who are eager for goodness. And so when the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was seated in separate parties of twelve, in the large open court, when one of the brethren had been rather slow in fetching and bringing in a dish, the aforesaid Abbot <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who was busily hurrying about among the troops of brethren who were serving, saw it and struck him such a blow before them all on his open palm that the sound of the hand which was struck actually reached the ears of those whose backs were turned and who were sitting some way off. But the youth of remarkable patience received it with such calmness of mind that not only did he let no word fall from his mouth or give the slightest sign of murmuring by the silent movements of his lips, but actually did not change colour in the slightest degree or (lose) the modest and peaceful look about his mouth. And this fact struck with astonishment not merely us, who had lately come from a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and had not learned the blessing of this patience by such clear examples, but all those as well who were not without experience of such earnestness, so that by it a great lesson was taught even to those who were well advanced, because even if this paternal correction had not disturbed his patience, neither did the presence of so great a number bring the slightest sign of colour to his cheeks.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>Of Abbot John's humility and our question.</strong></p>

<p>In this C&oelig;nobium then we found a very old man named John, whose words and humility we think ought certainly not to be passed over in silence as in them he excelled all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he was especially vigorous in this perfection, which though it is the mother of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and the surest foundation of the whole spiritual superstructure, yet is altogether a stranger to our system. Wherefore it is no wonder that we cannot attain to the height of those men, as we cannot stand the training of the C&oelig;nobium I will not say up to old age, but are scarcely content to endure the yoke of subjection for a couple of years, and at once escape to enjoy a dangerous liberty, while even for that short time we seem to be subject to the rule of the Elder not according to any strict rule, but as our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> directs. When then we had seen this old man in Abbot <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> C&oelig;nobium, we were struck, first by his age and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with which the man was endowed, and with looks fixed on the ground began to entreat him to vouchsafe to explain to us why he had forsaken the freedom of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> and that exalted profession, in which his fame and celebrity had raised him above others who had adopted the same life, and why he had chosen to enter under the yoke of the C&oelig;nobium. He said that as he was unequal to the system of the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> and unworthy of the heights of such perfection, he had gone back to the infant school, that he might learn to carry out the lessons taught there, according as the life demanded. And when our entreaties were not satisfied and we refused to take this <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> answer, at last he began as follows.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>Abbot John's answer why he had left the desert.</strong></p>

<p>The system of the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a>, which you are surprised at my leaving, I not only neither reject nor refuse, but rather embrace and regard with the utmost veneration: in which system, and after I had passed thirty years living in a C&oelig;nobium, I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that I have also spent twenty more, so that I can never be accused of sloth among those who tried it in a half-hearted way. But because its purity, of which I had had some slight experience, was sometimes soiled by the presence of anxiety about carnal matters, it seemed better to return to the C&oelig;nobium to secure a readier attainment of an easier aim undertaken, and less danger from venturing on the higher life of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> solitary.  For it is better to seem earnest with smaller promises than careless in larger ones. And therefore if possibly I bring forward anything somewhat arrogantly and indeed somewhat too freely, I beg that you will not think it due to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of boasting but rather to my desire for your edification; and that, as I think that, when you ask so earnestly, nothing of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should be kept back from you, you will set it down to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> rather than to boasting. For I think that some instruction may be given to you if I lay aside my humility, and simply lay bare the whole <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about my aim. For I trust that I shall not incur any reproach of vainglory from you because of the freedom of my words, nor any charge of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> from my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> because of any suppression of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>Of the excellence which the aforesaid old man showed in the system of the anchorites.</strong></p>

<p>If then anyone else delights in the recesses of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> and would forget all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> intercourse and say with Jeremiah: <q>I have not desired the day of man: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352108"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse16">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:16</a></span> I confess that by the blessing of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, I also secured or at any rate tried to secure this. And so by the kind gift of the Lord I remember that I was often caught up into such an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> as to forget that I was clothed with the burden of a weak body, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on a sudden forgot all external notions and entirely cut itself off from all material objects, so that neither my eyes nor ears performed their proper functions. And my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was so filled with divine meditations and spiritual contemplations that often in the evening I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether I had taken any food and on the next day was very doubtful whether I had broken my fast yesterday. For which reason, a supply of food for seven days, i.e., seven sets of biscuits were set apart in a sort of hand-basket,  and laid by on Saturday, that there might be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> when supper had been omitted; and by this plan another mistake also from forgetfulness was obviated, for when the number of cakes was finished it showed that the course of the week was over, and that the services of the same day had come round, and that the festival and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day and services of the congregation could not escape the notice of the solitary. But even if that <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> of mind of which we have spoken should happen to interfere with this arrangement, yet still the method of the days' work would show the number of the days and check the mistake. And to pass over in silence the other advantages of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> (for it is not our business to treat of their number and quantity, but rather of the aim of solitude and the C&oelig;nobium) I will the rather briefly explain the reasons why I preferred to leave it, which you also wanted to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and will in a concise discourse glance at all those fruits of solitude which I mentioned, and show to what greater advantages on the other side they ought to be held inferior.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>Of the advantages of the desert.</strong></p>

<p>So long then as owing to the fewness of those who were then living in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, a greater freedom was afforded to us in a wider expanse of the wilderness, so long as in the seclusion of larger retreats we were caught up to those celestial ecstasies, and were not overwhelmed by a great quantity of brethren to visit us, and thus owing to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of showing hospitality overburdened in our thoughts by the distractions of great cares, I frequented with insatiable desire and all my heart the peaceful retreats of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> and that life which can only be compared to the bliss of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But when, as I said, a larger number of the brethren began to seek a dwelling in that desert, and by cramping the freedom of the vast wilderness, not only caused that fire of divine <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> to grow cold, but also entangled the mind in many ways in the chains of carnal matters, I determined to carry out my purpose in this system rather than to grow cold in that sublime mode of life, by providing for carnal wants; so that, if that liberty and those spiritual ecstasies are denied me, yet as all care for the morrow is avoided, I may console myself by fulfilling the precept of the gospel, and what I lose in sublimity of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, may be made up to me by submission and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. For it is a wretched thing for a man to profess to learn any art or pursuit, and never to arrive at perfection in it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>Of the conveniences of the C&oelig;nobium.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore I will briefly explain what advantages I now enjoy in this manner of life. <em>You</em> must consider my words and judge whether those advantages of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> outweigh these comforts, and by this you will also be able to prove whether I chose to be cramped within the narrow limits of the C&oelig;nobium from dislike or from desire of that purity of the solitary life. In this life then there is no providing for the day's work, no distractions of buying and selling, no unavoidable care for the year's food, no anxiety about bodily things, by which one has to get ready what is necessary not only for one's own wants but also for those of any number of visitors, finally no conceit from the praise of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which is worse than all these things and sometimes in the sight of God does away with the good of even great efforts in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. But, to pass over those waves of spiritual <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and the deadly peril of vainglory in the life of the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a>, let us return to this general burden which affects everybody, i.e., the ordinary anxiety in providing food, which has so far exceeded I say not the measure of that ancient strictness which altogether did without oil, but is beginning not to be content even with the relaxation of our own time according to which the requirements of all the supply of food for a year were satisfied by the preparation of a single pint of oil and a modius of lentils prepared for the use of visitors; but now the needful supply of food is scarcely met by two or three times that amount. And to such an extent has the force of this dangerous relaxation grown among some that, when they mix vinegar and sauce, they do not add that single drop of oil, which our predecessors who followed the rules of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> with greater powers of abstinence, were accustomed to pour in simply for the sake of avoiding vainglory,  but they break an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> cheese for luxury and pour over it more oil than is required, and so take, under a single pleasant relish, two sorts of food which differ in their special flavour, each of which ought singly to be a pleasant refreshment at different times for a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. To such a pitch however has this <span class="greek">&#x1F51;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F74; &#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>, i.e., acquisition of material things grown, that actually under pretence of hospitality and welcoming guests <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> have begun to keep a blanket in their cells&mdash; a thing which I cannot mention without shame&mdash; to omit those things by which the mind that is awed by and intent on spiritual meditation is more especially hampered; viz., the concourse of brethren, the duties of receiving the coming and speeding the parting guest, visits to each other and the endless worry of various confabulations and occupations, the expectation of which owing to the continuous character of these customary interruptions keeps the mind on the stretch even during the time when these bothers seem to cease. And so the result is that the freedom of the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite's</a> life is so hindered by these ties that it can never rise to that ineffable keenness of heart, and thus loses the fruits of its hermit life. And if this is now denied to me while I am living in the congregation and among others, at least there is no lack of peace of mind and tranquillity of heart that is freed from all business. And unless this is ready at hand for those also who live in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, they will indeed have to undergo the labours of the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite's</a> life, but will lose its fruits which can only be gained in peaceful stability of mind. Finally even if there is any diminution of my purity of heart while I am living in the C&oelig;nobium, I shall be satisfied by keeping in exchange that one precept of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which certainly cannot be less esteemed than all those fruits of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>; I mean that I should take no thought for the morrow, and submitting myself completely to the Abbot seem in some degree to emulate</p>

<p>Him of whom it is said: He humbled Himself, and became <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death; and so be able humbly to make use of His words: <q>For I came not to do my own will, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father which sent me.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>A question on the fruits of the C&oelig;nobium and the desert.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: Since it is evident that you have not, like so many, just touched the mere outskirts of each mode of life, but have ascended to the very heights, we should like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is the end of the C&oelig;nobite's life and what the end of the hermit's. For no one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that no man can discourse with greater fullness or fidelity on these subjects than one who, taught by long use and experience, has followed them both, and so can by veracious teaching show us their value and aim.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>The answer to the question proposed.</strong></p>

<p>John: I should absolutely maintain that one and the same man could not attain perfection in both lives unless I was hindered by the example of some few. And since it is no small matter to find a man who is perfect in either of them, it is clear how much harder and I had almost said impossible it is for a man to be thoroughly efficient in both. And if this has ever happened, it cannot come under any general rule. For a general rule must be based not on exceptional instances, i.e., on the experience of a very few, but on what is within the power of the many or rather of all. But what is attained to here and there by but one or two, and is beyond the capacity of ordinary goodness, must be kept out of general rules as something permitted outside the condition and nature of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, and should be brought forward as a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> rather than as an example. Wherefore I will, as my slender ability allows, briefly intimate what you want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. The aim indeed of the C&oelig;nobite is to mortify and crucify all his desires and, according to that salutary command of evangelic perfection, to take no thought for the morrow. And it is perfectly clear that this perfection cannot be attained by any except a C&oelig;nobite, such a man as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah describes and blesses and praises as follows: <q>If you turn away your foot from the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, from doing your own will in my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day, and glorify Him, while thou dost not your own ways, and your own will is not found to speak a word: then shall you be delighted in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and I will lift you up above the high places of the earth, and will feed you with the inheritance of Jacob your father. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352112"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;58:13-14</a></span> But the perfection for a hermit is to have his mind freed from all earthly things, and to unite it, as far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty allows, with Christ: and such a man the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah describes when he says: <q>Blessed is the man who has borne the yoke from his youth. He shall sit solitary and hold his peace, because he has taken it upon himself;</q> the Psalmist also: <q>I have become like a pelican in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. I watched and became as a sparrow alone upon the housetop.</q>  To this aim then, which we have described as that of either life, unless each of them attains, in vain does the one adopt the system of the C&oelig;nobium, and the other of the hermitage: for neither of them will get the good of his method of life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>Of true and complete perfection.</strong></p>

<p>But this is <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F75;</span>, i.e., no thorough and altogether complete perfection, but only a partial one. Perfection then is very rare and granted by God's gift to but a very few. For he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and not partially perfect who with equal imperturbability can put up with the squalor of the wilderness in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, as well as the infirmities of the brethren in the C&oelig;nobium. And so it is hard to find one who is perfect in both lives, because the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a> cannot thoroughly acquire <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1F7B;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;</span>, i.e., a disregard for and stripping oneself of material things, nor the C&oelig;nobite purity in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, although we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Abbot <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Paphnutius and the two Macarii  were masters of both in perfection. And so they were perfect in either life, and while they withdrew further than all the dwellers in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> and delighted themselves unceasingly in the retirement of the wilderness, and as far as in them lay never sought intercourse with other men, yet they put up with the presence and the infirmities of those who came to them so that when a large number of the brethren came to them for the sake of seeing them and profiting by it, they endured this almost continuous trouble of receiving them with imperturbable patience, and men fancied that all the days of their life they had neither learned nor practised anything but how to show common civility to those who came, so that it was a puzzle to all to say in which life their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> was mainly shown, i.e., whether their greatness adapted itself more remarkably to the purity of the hermitage or to the common life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>Of those who while still imperfect retire into the desert.</strong></p>

<p>But some are sometimes so tantalized by the silence of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> lasting all through the day that they altogether dread intercourse with men, and, when they have even for a little while broken through their habit of retirement owing to the accident of a visit from some of the brethren, boil over with marked vexation of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and show clear signs of annoyance. And this especially happens in the case of those who have betaken themselves to the solitary life without a well-matured purpose and without being thoroughly trained in the C&oelig;nobium, as these men are always imperfect and easily upset, and incline to one side or the other, as the gales of trouble may drive them. For as they boil over impatiently at intercourse or conversation with the brethren, so while they are living in solitude they cannot stand the vastness of that silence which they themselves have courted, inasmuch as they themselves do not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the reason why solitude ought to be wanted and sought for, but <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the value and the main part of this life consist in this; viz., in avoiding intercourse with the brethren and simply shunning and loathing the sight of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>A question how to cure those who have hastily left the congregation of the C&oelig;nobium.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: By what treatment can any help be given to us or to others who are thus weak and only up to this; who had received but little instruction in the system of the C&oelig;nobium when we began to aspire to dwell in solitude before we had got rid of our faults; or by what means shall we be able to acquire the constancy of an imperturbable <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and immovable steadfastness of patience; we who all too soon gave up the common life in the C&oelig;nobium, and forsook the schools and training ground for these exercises, in which our principles ought first to have been thoroughly schooled and perfected? How then can we now while we are living alone gain perfection in long-suffering and patience; or how can <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, that searcher out of inward motives, discover whether these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> exist in us or are wanting, so that because we are severed from intercourse with men, and not irritated by any of their provocations, we may not be deceived by false notions, and fancy that we have gained that imperturbable peace of mind?</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>The answer telling how a solitary can discover his faults.</strong></p>

<p>John: To those who are really seeking relief, healing remedies from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Physician of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will certainly not be wanting; and to those above all will they be given who do not disregard their ill-condition (either because they despair of it, or because they do not care about it), nor hide the danger they are in from their wound, nor in their wanton heart reject the remedy of penitence, but with an <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and yet careful heart flee to the heavenly Physician for the diseases they have contracted from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or necessity. And so we ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that if we retire to solitude or secret places, without our faults being first cured, their operation is but repressed, while the power of feeling them is not extinguished. For the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not having been eradicated is still lying hid in us, or rather creeping up, and that it is still alive we can tell by these signs. For instance, if, when we are living in solitude we receive the approach of some brethren, or any very slight tarrying on their part, with any anxiety or fretfulness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, we should recognize that an incentive to the most hasty impatience is still existing in us. But if when we are hoping for the coming of a brother, and from some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> he perhaps delays a little, our mental indignation either silently blames his slowness, and annoyance at this inconvenient waiting disturbs our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the examination of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> will show that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and vexation is plainly still remaining in us. Again, if when a brother asks for our book to read, or for some other article to use, his request annoys us, or a refusal on our part disgusts him, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that we are still entangled in the meshes of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. But if a sudden thought or a passage of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> brings up the recollection of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and we feel that we are at all attracted towards her, we should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the fire of fornication is not yet extinguished in us. But if on a comparison of our own strictness with the laxity of another even the slightest conceit tries our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it is clear that we are affected with the dreadful plague of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. When then we detect these signs of faults in our heart, we should clearly recognize that it is only the opportunity and not the passion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which we are deprived. And certainly these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, if at any time we were to mingle in the ordinary life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, would at once start up from their lurking places in our thoughts and prove that they did not then for the first time come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> when they broke out, but that they were then at last made public, because they had been long lying hid. And so even a solitary can detect by sure signs that the roots of each fault are still implanted in him, if he tries not to show his purity to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but to maintain it inviolate in His sight, from whom no secrets of the heart can be hid.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><strong>A question how a man can be cured who has entered on solitude without having his faults eradicated.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: We very clearly and plainly see the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> by which the signs of infirmities are inferred, and the method of discerning diseases, i.e., how the faults which are concealed in us can be detected: for our every day experience and the daily motions of our thoughts show us all these as they have been stated. It remains then that as the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> and causes of our maladies have been exposed to us in a most clear way so their remedies and cures may also be shown. For no one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that one who has first discovered the grounds and beginnings of ailments, with the approving <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of those affected, can best discourse on their remedies. And so though the teaching of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has laid bare the secrets of our wounds whereby we venture to have some hope of a remedy, because so clear a diagnosis of the disease gives promise of the hope of a cure, yet because, as you say, the first elements of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> are acquired in the C&oelig;nobium, and men cannot be in a sound condition in solitude, unless they have first been healed by the medicine of the C&oelig;nobium, we have fallen again into a dangerous state of despair lest as we left the C&oelig;nobium in an imperfect condition we may not now that we are in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> succeed in becoming perfect.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>The answer on their remedies.</strong></p>

<p>John: For those who are anxious for the cure of their ailments a saving remedy is sure not to be wanting, and therefore remedies should be sought by the same means that the signs of each fault are discovered. For as we have said that the faults of men's ordinary life are not wanting to solitaries, so we do not deny that all <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and all the means of healing are at the disposal of all those who are cut off from men's ordinary life. When then anyone discovers by those signs which we described above, that he is attacked by outbreaks of impatience or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, he should always practise himself in the opposite and contrary things, and by setting before himself all sorts of injuries and wrongs, as if offered to him by somebody else, accustom his mind to submit with perfect humility to everything that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> can bring upon him; and by often representing to himself all kinds of rough and intolerable things, continually consider with all sorrow of heart with what gentleness he ought to meet them. And, by thus looking at the sufferings of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, or indeed at those of the Lord Himself, he will admit that the various reproaches as well as punishments are less than he deserves, and prepare himself to endure all kinds of griefs. And when occasionally he has been recalled by some invitation to the assembly of the brethren&mdash; a thing which cannot but happen every now and then even to the strictest inmates of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>&mdash;if he finds that his mind is silently disturbed even for trifles, he should like some stern censor of his secret emotions charge himself with all those various hard wrongs, to the perfect endurance of which he was training himself by his daily meditations, and blaming and chiding himself as follows, say My <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, are you the fellow who while training yourself in the practising ground of solitude, ventured most determinedly to think that you would get the better of all bad qualities, and who just now, when you were representing to yourself not only all sorts of bitter reproaches, but also intolerable punishments, fancied that you were pretty strong and able to stand against all storms? How is it that that unconquered patience of yours is upset by the first trial even of a light word? How is it that even a gentle breeze has shaken that house of yours which you fancied was built so strongly on the solid rock? Where is that which you announced when during a time of peace you were in your foolish confidence longing for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>? <q>I am ready, and am not troubled;</q> and this which you used often to say with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Prove me, O Lord, and try me: search out my reins and my heart;</q> and: <q>prove me, O Lord, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my heart: question me and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my paths; and see if there be any way of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in me.</q>  How has a tiny ghost of an enemy frightened your grand preparations for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>? With such reproaches and remorse a man should condemn himself and not allow the sudden <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which has upset him to go unpunished, but by chastising his flesh with a severer penalty of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>; and, by punishing his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of lightness of mind by continual pains of self-restraint, he should while living in solitude consume in this fire of practice what he ought to have thoroughly driven out in the life of the C&oelig;nobium. This at any rate we must firmly and resolutely hold to in order to secure a lasting and unbroken patience; viz., that for us, to whom by the Divine law not merely vengeance for, but even the recollection of injuries is forbidden, it is not permissible to be roused to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> because of some loss or annoyance. For what greater injury can happen to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than for it, owing to some sudden blindness from rage, to lose the brightness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light and to fail of the sight of Him <q>Who is meek and lowly of heart?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352116"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;11:29</a></span> What I ask could be more dangerous or awkward than for a man to lose his power of judging of goodness, and his standard and rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> discernment, and for one in his sober senses to do what even a drunken man, and a fool would not be pardoned for doing? One then who carefully considers these and other injuries of the same kind, will readily endure and disregard not only all kinds of losses, but also whatever wrongs and punishments can be inflicted by the cruellest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as he will hold that there is nothing more damaging than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, nor more valuable than peace of mind and unbroken purity of heart, for the sake of which we should think nothing of the advantages not merely of carnal matters but also of those things which appear to be spiritual, if they cannot be gained or done without some disturbance of this tranquillity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>A question whether chastity ought to be ascertained just as the other feelings.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: As the cure for other ailments, viz., <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, vexation, and impatience, has been shown to consist in opposing to them their contraries, so also we should like to learn what sort of treatment we ought to use against the spirit of fornication: I mean, whether the fire of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> can be quenched by the representation, as in those other cases, of greater inducements and things to excite it: because not merely to increase the incentives to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> within us, but even to touch them with a passing look of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be utterly fatal to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>The answer giving the proofs by which it can be recognized.</strong></p>

<p>John: Your shrewd question has anticipated the subject, which even if you had said nothing must have arisen from our discourse, and therefore I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it will be effectually grasped by your minds, since indeed your sharp wits have outstripped our instruction. For the puzzle of any question is easily removed, when the inquiry anticipates the answer, and is the first to travel along the road which it is to follow. And so to the treatment of those faults of which we have spoken above, intercourse with other men is not merely no hindrance, but a considerable help, for the more often that the outbursts of their impatience are exposed, the more thorough is the sorrow and compunction which they bring on those who have failed, and the speedier is the recovery of health which they confer on those who struggle against them. Wherefore even when we are living in solitude, though the incentive to irritation and matter for it cannot arise from men, yet we ought of set purpose to meditate on incitements to it, that as we are fighting against it with a continual struggle in our thoughts a speedier cure for it may be found for us. But against the spirit of fornication the system is different, and the method an altered one. For as we must deprive the body of opportunities of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and contact with flesh, so we must deprive the mind of the recollection of it. For it is sufficiently dangerous for bosoms that are still weak and infirm even to tolerate the slightest recollection of this passion, in such a way that sometimes at the remembrance of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, or in reading a story in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> a stimulus of dangerous excitement is aroused. For which reason our Elders used deliberately to omit passages of this kind when any of the juniors were present. However for those who are perfect and established in the feelings of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> there can be no lack of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> by which they may examine themselves, and establish their perfect uprightness of heart by the uncorrupted judgment of their own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. There will then be for the man who is thoroughly established a similar test even in regard to this passion, so that one who is sure that he has altogether exterminated the roots of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may for the sake of ascertaining his <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, call up some picture as with a lascivious mind. But it is by no means proper for such a test to be attempted by those who are still weak (for to them it will be dangerous rather than useful), ut conjunctionem femineam et palpationem quodammodo teneram atque mollissimam corde pertractent. Cum ergo perfecta quis virtute fundatus ad illecebram blandissimorum tactuum, quos cogitando confinxerit, nullum mentis assensum, nullam commotionem carnis in se deprehenderit exagitatam, he will have a very sure <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his purity, so that training himself to this steadfast purity he will not only possess the blessing of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and freedom from defilement in his heart, but even if he is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to touch the body of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, he will be horrified at it.</p>

<p>With this Abbot John brought his Conference to an end, as he saw that it was just time for the refreshment of the ninth hour.</p>
