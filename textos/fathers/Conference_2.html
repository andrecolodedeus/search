<h1>Conference 2</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>SECOND CONFERENCE OF ABBOT MOSES.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>Abbot Moses' introduction on the grace of discretion.</strong></p>

<p>And so when we had enjoyed our morning sleep, when to our delight the dawn of light again shone upon us, and we had begun to ask once more for his promised talk, the blessed <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> thus began: As I see you inflamed with such an eager desire, that I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that that very short interval of quiet which I wanted to subtract from our spiritual conference and devote to bodily rest, has been of any use for the repose of your bodies, on me too a greater anxiety presses when I take note of your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. For I must give the greater care and devotion in paying my debt, in proportion as I see that you ask for it the more earnestly, according to that saying: <q>When you sit to eat with a ruler consider diligently what is put before you, and put forth your hand, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you ought to prepare such things.</q>  Wherefore as we are going to speak of the excellent quality of discretion and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of it, on which subject our discourse of last night had entered at the termination of our discussion, we think it desirable first to establish its excellence by the opinions of the fathers, that when it has been shown what our predecessors thought and said about it, then we may bring forward some ancient and modern shipwrecks and mischances of various people, who were destroyed and hopelessly ruined because they paid but little attention to it, and then as well as we can we must treat of its advantages and uses: after a discussion of which we shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> better how we ought to seek after it and practise it, by the consideration of the importance of its value and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For it is no ordinary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> nor one which can be freely gained by merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> efforts, unless they are aided by the Divine blessing, for we read that this is also reckoned among the noblest gifts of the Spirit by the Apostle: <q>To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the same Spirit, to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the same Spirit, to another the gift of healing by the same Spirit,</q> and shortly after, <q>to another the discerning of spirits.</q> Then after the complete catalogue of spiritual gifts he subjoins: <q>But all these works one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351161"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:8-11</a></span> You see then that the gift of discretion is no earthly thing and no slight matter, but the greatest prize of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>. And unless a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> has pursued it with all <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and secured a power of discerning with unerring judgment the spirits that rise up in him, he is sure to go wrong, as if in the darkness of night and dense blackness, and not merely to fall down dangerous pits and precipices, but also to make frequent mistakes in matters that are plain and straightforward.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>What discretion alone can give a monk; and a discourse of the blessed Antony on this subject.</strong></p>

<p>And so I remember that while I was still a boy, in the region of Thebaid, where the blessed Antony lived,  the elders came to him to inquire about perfection: and though the conference lasted from evening till morning, the greatest part of the night was taken up with this question. For it was discussed at great length what <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or observance could preserve a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> always unharmed by the snares and deceits of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and carry him forward on a sure and right path, and with firm step to the heights of perfection. And when each one gave his opinion according to the bent of his own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and some made it consist in <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, because a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that has been brought low by these, and so obtained purity of heart and body will be the more easily united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, others in despising all things, as, if the mind were utterly deprived of them, it would come the more freely to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if henceforth there were no snares to entangle it: others thought that withdrawal from the world was the thing needful, i.e., solitude and the secrecy of the hermit's life; living in which a man may more readily commune with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and cling more especially to Him; others laid down that the duties of charity, i.e., of kindness should be practised, because the Lord in the gospel promised more especially to give the kingdom to these; when He said <q>Come you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an hungred and you gave Me to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me to drink, etc.:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351163"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;25:35-36</a></span> and when in this fashion they declared that by means of different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> a more certain approach to God could be secured, and the greater part of the night had been spent in this discussion, then at last the blessed Antony spoke and said: All these things which you have mentioned are indeed needful, and helpful to those who are thirsting for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and desirous to approach Him. But countless accidents and the experience of many people will not allow us to make the most important of gifts consist in them. For often when men are most strict in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or in <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, and nobly withdraw into solitude, and aim at depriving themselves of all their goods so absolutely that they do not suffer even a day's allowance of food or a single penny to remain to them, and when they fulfil all the duties of kindness with the utmost devotion, yet still we have seen them suddenly deceived, so that they could not bring the work they had entered upon to a suitable close, but brought their exalted fervour and praiseworthy manner of life to a terrible end. Wherefore we shall be able clearly to recognize what it is which mainly leads to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if we trace out with greater care the reason of their downfall and deception. For when the works of the above mentioned <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were abounding in them, discretion alone was wanting, and allowed them not to continue even to the end. Nor can any other reason for their falling off be discovered except that as they were not sufficiently instructed by their elders they could not obtain judgment and discretion, which passing by excess on either side, teaches a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> always to walk along the royal road, and does not suffer him to be puffed up on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, i.e., from excess of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to transgress the bounds of due moderation in foolish presumption, nor allows him to be enamoured of slackness and turn aside to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> on the left hand, i.e., under pretext of controlling the body, to grow slack with the opposite spirit of luke-warmness. For this is discretion, which is termed in the gospel the <q>eye,</q> <q>and light of the body,</q> according to the Saviour's saying: <q>The light of your body is your eye: but if your eye be single, your whole body will be full of light, but if your eye be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, your whole body will be full of darkness:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351164"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;6:22-23</a></span> because as it discerns all the thoughts and actions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, it sees and overlooks all things which should be done. But if in any man this is <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> i.e., not fortified by sound judgment and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or deceived by some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and presumption, it will make our whole body <q>full of darkness,</q> i.e., it will darken all our mental vision and our actions, as they will be involved in the darkness of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and the gloom of disturbances. For, says He, <q>if the light which is in you be darkness, how great will that darkness be!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351165"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;6:22-23</a></span> For no one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that when the judgment of our heart goes wrong, and is overwhelmed by the night of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, our thoughts and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, which are the result of deliberation and discretion, must be involved in the darkness of still greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>Of the error of Saul and of Ahab, by which they were deceived through lack of discretion.</strong></p>

<p>Lastly, the man who in the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> was the first to be worthy of the kingdom of His people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because he was lacking in this <q>eye</q> of discretion, was, as if his whole body were full of darkness, actually cast down from the kingdom while, being deceived by the darkness of this <q>light,</q> and in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, he imagined that his own offerings were more acceptable to God than <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the command of Samuel, and met with an occasion of falling in that very matter in which he had hoped to propitiate the Divine Majesty. <span class="stiki" id="note351166"><a href="../bible/1sa015.htm">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;xv</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, I say, of this discretion led Ahab the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> after a triumph and splendid victory which had been granted to him by the favour of God to fancy that mercy on his part was better than the stern execution of the divine command, and, as it seemed to him, a cruel rule: and moved by this consideration, while he desired to temper a bloody victory with mercy, he was on account of his indiscriminating clemency rendered full of darkness in his whole body, and condemned irreversibly to death. <span class="stiki" id="note351167"><a href="../bible/1ki020.htm">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;xx</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>What is said of the value of discretion in Holy Scripture.</strong></p>

<p>Such is discretion, which is not only the <q>light of the body,</q> but also called the sun by the Apostle, as it said <q>Let not the sun go down upon your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351168"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse26">Ephesians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> It is also called the guidance of our life: as it said <q>Those who have no guidance, fall like leaves.</q>  It is most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> named counsel, without which the authority of Scripture allows us to do nothing, so that we are not even permitted to take that spiritual <q>wine which makes glad the heart of man</q>  without its regulating control: as it is said <q>Do everything with counsel, drink your wine with counsel,</q>  and again <q>like a city that has its walls destroyed and is not fenced in, so is a man who does anything without counsel.</q>  And how injurious the absence of this is to a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, the illustration and figure in the passage quoted shows, by comparing it to a city that is destroyed and without walls. Herein lies wisdom, herein lies intelligence and understanding without which our inward house cannot be built, nor can spiritual riches be gathered together, as it is said: <q>A house is built with wisdom, and again it is set up with intelligence. With understanding the storehouses are filled with all precious riches and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.</q>  This I say is <q>solid food,</q> which can only be taken by those who are full grown and strong, as it is said: <q>But solid food is for full grown men, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351174"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;5:14</a></span> And it is shown to be useful and necessary for us, only in so far as it is in accordance with the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and its powers, as is said <q>For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and reaching even to the dividing asunder of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351175"><a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse12">Hebrews&nbsp;4:12</a></span> and by this it is clearly shown that no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can possibly be perfectly acquired or continue without the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of discretion. And so by the judgment of the blessed Antony as well as of all others it has been laid down that it is discretion which leads a fearless <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> by fixed stages to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and preserves the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> mentioned above continually intact, by means of which one may ascend with less weariness to the extreme summit of perfection, and without which even those who toil most willingly cannot reach the heights of perfection. For discretion is the mother of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as well as their guardian and regulator.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>Of the death of the old man Heron.</strong></p>

<p>And to support this judgment delivered of old by the blessed Antony and the other fathers by a modern instance, as we promised to do, remember what you lately saw happen before your very eyes, I mean, how the old man Heron,  only a very few days ago was cast down by an illusion of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> from the heights to the depths, a man whom we remember to have lived for fifty years in this desert and to have preserved a strict continence with special severity, and who aimed at the secrecy of solitude with marvellous fervour beyond all those who dwell here. By what device then or by what method was he deluded by the deceiver after so many labours, and falling by a most grievous downfall struck with profound grief all those who live in this desert? Was it not because, having too little of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of discretion he preferred to be guided by his own judgment rather than to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the counsels and conference of the brethren and the regulations of the elders? Since he ever practised incessant abstinence and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> with such severity, and persisted in the secrecy of solitude and a monastic cell so constantly that not even the observance of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> festival could ever persuade him to join in the feast with the brethren: when in accordance with the annual observance, all the brethren remained in the church and he alone would not join them for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest he might seem to relax in some degree from his purpose by taking only a little pulse. And deceived by this presumption he received with the utmost reverence an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light and with blind slavishness <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> his commands and cast himself down a well, so deep that the eye could not pierce its depths, nothing doubting of the promise of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who had assured him that the merits of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and labours were such that he could not possibly run any risk. And that he might prove the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this most certainly by experimenting on his own safety, in the dead of night he was deluded enough to cast himself into the above mentioned well, to prove indeed the great merit of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> if he should come out thence unhurt. And when by great efforts on the part of the brethren he had been got out already almost dead, on the third day afterward he expired, and what was still worse, persisted in his obstinate delusion so that not even the experience of his death could persuade him that he had been deceived by the craft of devils. Wherefore in spite of the merits of his great labours and the number of years which he had spent in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> those who with compassion and the greatest kindness pitied his end, could hardly obtain from Abbot Paphnutius  that he should not be reckoned among suicides, and be deemed unworthy of the memorial and oblation for those at rest. </p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>Of the destruction of two brethren for lack of discretion.</strong></p>

<p>What shall I say of those two brethren who lived beyond that desert of the Thebaid where once the blessed Antony dwelt, and, not being sufficiently influenced by careful discrimination, when they were going through the vast and extended waste determined not to take any food with them, except such as the Lord Himself might provide for them. And when as they wandered through the deserts and were already fainting from hunger they were spied at a distance by the Mazices  (a race which is even more savage and ferocious than almost all wild tribes, for they are not driven to shed blood, as other tribes are, from desire of spoil but from simple ferocity of mind), and when these acting contrary to their natural ferocity, met them with bread, one of the two as discretion came to his aid, received it with delight and thankfulness as if it were offered to him by the Lord, thinking that the food had been divinely provided for him, and that it was God's doing that those who always delighted in bloodshed had offered the staff of life to men who were already fainting and dying; but the other refused the food because it was offered to him by men and died of starvation. And though this sprang in the first instance from a persuasion that was blame-worthy yet one of them by the help of discretion got the better of the idea which he had rashly and carelessly conceived, but the other persisting in his obstinate folly, and being utterly lacking in discretion, brought upon himself that death which the Lord would have averted, as he would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it was owing to a Divine impulse that the fierce barbarians forgot their natural ferocity and offered them bread instead of a sword.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>Of an illusion into which another fell for lack of discretion.</strong></p>

<p>Why also should I speak of one (whose name we had rather not mention as he is still alive), who for a long while received a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in the brightness of an angelic form, and was often deceived by countless revelations from him and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that he was a messenger of righteousness: for when these were granted, every night he provided a light in his cell without the need of any lamp. At last he was ordered by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to offer up to God his own son who was living with him in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, in order that his merits might by this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> be made equal to those of the patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. And he was so far seduced by his persuasion that he would really have committed the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> unless his son had seen him getting ready the knife and sharpening it with unusual care, and looking for the chains with which he meant to tie him up for the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> when he was going to offer him up; and had fled away in terror with a presentiment of the coming crime.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>Of the fall and deception of a monk of Mesopotamia.</strong></p>

<p>It is a long business too to tell the story of the deception of that <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Mesopotamia, who observed an abstinence that could be imitated by but few in that country, which he had practised for many years concealed in his cell, and at last was so deceived by revelations and dreams that came from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> that after so many labours and good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, in which he had surpassed all those who dwelt in the same parts, he actually relapsed miserably into <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the flesh. For when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by accustoming him to visions through the wish to entice him to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> in the end, had like a messenger of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> revealed to him for a long while what was perfectly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, at length he showed him <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> folk together with the leaders of our religion and creed; viz. Apostles and Martyrs, in darkness and filth, and foul and disfigured with all squalor, and on the other hand the Jewish people with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, dancing with all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and shining with dazzling light; and so persuaded him that if he wanted to share their reward and bliss, he must at once submit to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. And so none of these would have been so miserably deceived, if they had endeavoured to obtain a power of discretion. Thus the mischances and trials of many show how dangerous it is to be without the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of discretion.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>A question about the acquirement of true discretion.</strong></p>

<p>To this Germanus: It has been fully and completely shown both by recent instances and by the decisions of the ancients how discretion is in some sense the fountain head and the root of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. We want then to learn how it ought to be gained, or how we can tell whether it is genuine and from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or whether it is spurious and from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: so that (to use the figure of that gospel <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> which you discussed on a former occasion, in which we are bidden to become good money changers ) we may be able to see the figure of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> king stamped on the coin and to detect what is not stamped on coin that is current, and that, as you said in yesterday's talk using an ordinary expression, we may reject it as counterfeit, under the teaching of that skill which you treated of with sufficient fullness and detail, and showed ought to belong to the man who is spiritually a good money changer of the gospel. For of what good will it be to have recognized the value of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> if we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to seek for it and to gain it?</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>The answer how true discretion may be gained.</strong></p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: True discretion, said he, is only secured by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humility. And of this humility the first <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is given by reserving everything (not only what you do but also what you think), for the scrutiny of the elders, so as not to trust at all in your own judgment but to acquiesce in their decisions in all points, and to acknowledge what ought to be considered good or bad by their traditions.  And this habit will not only teach a young man to walk in the right path through the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way of discretion, but will also keep him unhurt by all the crafts and deceits of the enemy. For a man cannot possibly be deceived, who lives not by his own judgment but according to the example of the elders, nor will our crafty foe be able to abuse the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of one who is not accustomed from false modesty to conceal all the thoughts which rise in his heart, but either checks them or suffers them to remain, in accordance with the ripened judgment of the elders. For a wrong thought is enfeebled at the moment that it is discovered: and even before the sentence of discretion has been given, the foul serpent is by the power of confession dragged out, so to speak, from his dark under-ground cavern, and in some sense shown up and sent away in disgrace. For <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts will hold sway in us just so long as they are hidden in the heart: and that you may gather still more effectually the power of this judgment I will tell you what Abbot Serapion did,  and what he used often to tell to the younger brethren for their edification.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>The words of Abbot Serapion on the decline of thoughts that are exposed to others, and also on the danger of self-confidence.</strong></p>

<p>While, said he, I was still a lad, and stopping with Abbot Theonas,  this habit was forced upon me by the assaults of the enemy, that after I had supped with the old man at the ninth hour, I used every day secretly to hide a biscuit in my dress, which I would eat on the sly later on without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it. And though I was constantly guilty of the theft with the consent of my will, and the want of restraint that springs from desire that has grown inveterate, yet when my unlawful desire was gratified I would come to myself and torment myself over the theft committed in a way that overbalanced the pleasure I had enjoyed in the eating. And when I was forced not without grief of heart to fulfil day after day this most heavy task required of me, so to speak, by <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> taskmasters, instead of bricks, and could not escape from this cruel tyranny, and yet was ashamed to disclose the secret theft to the old man, it chanced by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God that I was delivered from the yoke of this <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> captivity, when certain brethren had sought the old man's cell with the object of being instructed by him. And when after supper the spiritual conference had begun to be held, and the old man in answer to the questions which they had propounded was speaking about the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> and the dominion of secret thoughts, and showing their nature and the awful power which they have so long as they are kept secret, I was overcome by the power of the discourse and was <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> stricken and terrified, as I thought that these things were mentioned by him because the Lord had revealed to the old man my bosom secrets; and first I was moved to secret sighs, and then my heart's compunction increased and I openly burst into sobs and tears, and produced from the folds of my dress which shared my theft and received it, the biscuit which I had carried off in my bad habit to eat on the sly; and I laid it in the midst and lying on the ground an begging for forgiveness confessed how I used to eat one every day in secret, and with copious tears implored them to intreat the Lord to free me from this dreadful slavery. Then the old man: <q>Have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, my child,</q> said he, <q>Without any words of mine, your confession frees you from this slavery. For you have today triumphed over your victorious adversary, by laying him low by your confession in a manner which more than makes up for the way in which you were overthrown by him through your former silence, as when, never confuting him with your own answer or that of another, you had allowed him to lord it over you, according to that saying of Solomon's: 'Because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the heart of the children of men is full within them to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>:'  and therefore after this exposure of him that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit will no longer be able to vex you, nor will that foul serpent henceforth make his lurking place in you, as he has been dragged out into light from the darkness by your life-giving confession.</q> The old man had not finished speaking when lo! A burning lamp proceeding from the folds of my dress filled the cell with a sulphureous smell so that the pungency of the odour scarcely allowed us to stay there: and the old man resuming his admonition said Lo! The Lord has visibly confirmed to you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of my words, so that you can see with your eyes how he who was the author of His Passion has been driven out from your heart by your life-giving confession, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the enemy who has been exposed will certainly no longer find a home in you, as his expulsion is made manifest. And so, as the old man declared, said he, the sway of that diabolical tyranny over me has been destroyed by the power of this confession and stilled for ever so that the enemy has never even tried to force upon me any more the recollection of this desire, nor have I ever felt myself seized with the passion of that furtive longing. And this meaning we see is neatly expressed in a figure in Ecclesiastes. <q>If</q> says he <q>a serpent bite without hissing there is no sufficiency for the charmer,</q>  showing that the bite of a serpent in silence is dangerous, i.e., if a suggestion or thought springing from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is not by means of confession shown to some charmer, I mean some spiritually minded person who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to heal the wound at once by charms from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, and to extract the deadly poison of the serpent from the heart, it will be impossible to help the sufferer who is already in danger and must soon die. In this way therefore we shall easily arrive at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> discretion, so as by following the steps of the Elders never to do anything novel nor to decide anything by or on our own responsibility, but to walk in all things as we are taught by their tradition and upright life. And the man who is strengthened by this system will not only arrive at the perfect method of discretion, but also will remain perfectly safe from all the wiles of the enemy: for by no other fault does the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> drag down a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> so precipitately and lead him away to death, as when he persuades him to despise the counsel of the Elders and to rely on his own opinion and judgment: for if all the arts and contrivances discovered by man's ingenuity and those which are only useful for the conveniences of this temporary life, though they can be felt with the hand and seen with the eye, can yet not be understood by anyone, without lessons from a teacher, how foolish it is to fancy that there is no need of an instructor in this one alone which is invisible and secret and can only be seen by the purest heart, a mistake in which brings about no mere temporary loss or one that can easily be repaired, but the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and everlasting death: for it is concerned with a daily and nightly conflict against no visible foes, but invisible and cruel ones, and a spiritual combat not against one or two only, but against countless hosts, failure in which is the more dangerous to all, in proportion as the foe is the fiercer and the attack the more secret. And therefore we should always follow the footsteps of the Elders with the utmost care, and bring to them everything which rises in our hearts, by removing the veil of shame.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>A confession of the modesty which made us ashamed to reveal our thoughts to the elders.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: The ground of that hurtful modesty, through which we endeavour to hide bad thoughts, is especially owing to this reason; viz., that we have heard of a superior of the Elders in the region of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, as it was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, who, when one of the brethren had laid bare his thoughts to him in a genuine confession, was afterwards extremely indignant and severely chid him for them. Whence it results that while we press them upon our selves and are ashamed to make them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the Elders, we cannot obtain the remedies that would heal them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><strong>The answer concerning the trampling down of shame, and the danger of one without contrition.</strong></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Just as all young men are not alike in fervour of spirit nor equally instructed in learning and good morals, so too we cannot find that all old men are equally perfect and excellent. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> riches of old men are not to be measured by grey hairs but by their diligence in youth and the rewards of their past labours. <q>For,</q> says one, <q>the things that you have not gathered in your youth, how shall you find them in your old age?</q> <q>For venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years: but the understanding of a man is grey hairs, and a spotless life is old age.</q>  And therefore we are not to follow in the steps or embrace the traditions and advice of every old man whose head is covered with grey hairs, and whose age is his sole claim to respect, but only of those whom we find to have distinguished themselves in youth in an approved and praiseworthy manner, and to have been trained up not on self-assurance but on the traditions of the Elders. For there are some, and unhappily they form the majority, who pass their old age in a lukewarmness which they contracted in youth, and in sloth, and so obtain authority not from the ripeness of their character but simply from the number of their years. Against whom that reproof of the Lord is specially aimed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Strangers have devoured his strength and he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not: yea, grey hairs also are spread about upon him, and he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351187"><a href="../bible/hos007.htm#verse9">Hosea&nbsp;7:9</a></span> These men, I say, are not pointed out as examples to youth from the uprightness of their lives, nor from the strictness of their profession, which would be worthy of praise and imitation, but simply from the number of their years; and so the subtle enemy uses their grey hairs to deceive the younger men, by a wrongful appeal to their authority, and endeavours in his cunning craftiness to upset and deceive by their example those who might have been urged into the way of perfection by their advice or that of others; and drags them down by means of their teaching and practice either into a baneful indifference, or into deadly despair. And as I want to give you an instance of this, I will tell you a fact which may supply us with some wholesome teaching, without giving the name of the actor, lest we might be guilty of something of the same kind as the man who published abroad the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the brother which had been disclosed to him. When this one, who was not the laziest of young men, had gone to an old man, whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> very well, for the sake of the profit and health of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and had candidly confessed that he was troubled by carnal appetites and the spirit of fornication, fancying that he would receive from the old man's words consolation for his efforts, and a cure for the wounds inflicted on him, the old man attacked him with the bitterest reproaches, and called him a miserable and disgraceful creature, and unworthy of the name of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, while he could be affected by a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of this character, and instead of helping him so injured him by his reproaches that he dismissed him from his cell in a state of hopeless despair and deadly despondency. And when he, oppressed with such a sorrow, was plunged in deep thought, no longer how to cure his passion, but how to gratify his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, the Abbot Apollos,  the most skilful of the Elders, met him, and seeing by his looks and gloominess his trouble and the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the assault which he was secretly revolving in his heart, asked him the reason of this upset; and when he could not possibly answer the old man's gentle inquiry, the latter perceived more and more clearly that it was not without reason that he wanted to hide in silence the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a gloom so deep that he could not conceal it by his looks, and so began to ask him still more earnestly the reasons for his hidden grief. And by this he was forced to confess that he was on his way to a village to take a wife, and leave the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and return to the world, since, as the old man had told him, he could not be a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, if he was unable to control the desires of the flesh and to cure his passion. And then the old man smoothed him down with kindly consolation, and told him that he himself was daily tried by the same pricks of desire and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and that therefore he ought not to give way to despair, nor be surprised at the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the attack of which he would get the better not so much by <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> efforts, as by the mercy and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord; and he begged him to put off his intention just for one day, and having implored him to return to his cell, went as fast as he could to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the above mentioned old man&mdash; and when he had drawn near to him he stretched forth his hands and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with tears, and said <q>O Lord, who alone art the righteous judge and unseen Physician of secret strength and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, turn the assault from the young man upon the old one, that he may learn to condescend to the weakness of sufferers, and to sympathize even in old age with the frailties of youth.</q> And when he had ended his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with tears, he sees a filthy <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> standing over against his cell and aiming fiery darts at him, with which he was straightway wounded, and came out of his cell and ran about here and there like a lunatic or a drunken man, and going in and out could no longer restrain himself in it, but began to hurry off in the same direction in which the young man had gone. And when Abbot Apollos saw him like a madman driven wild by the furies, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the fiery dart of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> which he had seen, had been fixed in his heart, and had by its intolerable heat wrought in him this mental aberration and confusion of the understanding; and so he came up to him and asked <q>Whither are you hurrying, or what has made you forget the gravity of years and disturbed you in this childish way, and made you hurry about so rapidly</q>?</p>

<p>And when he owing to his guilty <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and confused by this disgraceful excitement fancied that the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of his heart was discovered, and, as the secrets of his heart were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the old man, did not venture to return any answer to his inquiries, <q>Return,</q> said he, to your cell, and at last recognize the fact that till now you have been ignored or despised by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and not counted in the number of those with whom he is daily roused to fight and struggle against their efforts and earnestness&mdash;you who could not&mdash; I will not say ward off, but not even postpone for one day, a single dart of his aimed at you after so many years spent in this profession of yours. And with this the Lord has suffered you to be wounded that you may at least learn in your old age to sympathize with infirmities to which you are a stranger, and may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from your own case and experience how to condescend to the frailties of the young, though when you received a young man troubled by an attack from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, you did not encourage him with any consolation, but gave him up in dejection and destructive despair into the hands of the enemy, to be, as far as you were concerned, miserably destroyed by him. But the enemy would certainly never have attacked him with so fierce an onslaught, with which he has up till now scorned to attack you, unless in his jealousy at the progress he was to make, he had endeavoured to get the better of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which he saw lay in his disposition, and to destroy it with his fiery darts, as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> without the shadow of a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he was the stronger, since he deemed it worth his while to attack him with such vehemence. And so learn from your own experience to sympathize with those in trouble, and never to terrify with destructive despair those who are in danger, nor harden them with severe speeches, but rather restore them with gentle and kindly consolations, and as the wise Solomon says, <q>Spare not to deliver those who are led forth to death, and to redeem those who are to be slain,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351189"><a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse11">Proverbs&nbsp;24:11</a></span> and after the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, break not the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax, <span class="stiki" id="note351190"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;12:20</a></span> and ask of the Lord that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by means of which you yourself may faithfully learn both in deed and power to sing: <q>the Lord has given me a learned tongue that I should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to uphold by word him that is weary:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351191"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;50:4</a></span> for no one could bear the devices of the enemy, or extinguish or repress those carnal fires which burn with a sort of natural flame, unless God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> assisted our weakness, or protected and supported it. And therefore, as the reason for this salutary incident is over, by which the Lord meant to set that young man free from dangerous desires and to teach you something of the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of their attack, and of the feeling of compassion, let us together implore Him in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that He may be pleased to remove that scourge, which the Lord thought good to lay upon you for your good (for <q>He makes sorry and cures: he strikes and his hands heal. He <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> and exalts, he kills and makes alive: he brings down to the grave and brings up</q>) , and may extinguish with the abundant dew of His Spirit the fiery darts of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, which at my desire He allowed to wound you. And although the Lord removed this <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> at a single <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the old man with the same speed with which He had suffered it to come upon him, yet He showed by a clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that a man's faults when laid bare were not merely not to be scolded, but that the grief of one in trouble ought not to be lightly despised. And therefore never let the clumsiness or shallowness of one old man or of a few deter you and keep you back from that life-giving way, of which we spoke earlier, or from the tradition of the Elders, if our crafty enemy makes a wrongful use of their grey hairs in order to deceive younger men: but without any cloak of shame everything should be disclosed to the Elders, and remedies for wounds be faithfully received from them together with examples of life and conversation: from which we shall find like help and the same sort of result, if we try to do nothing at all on our own responsibility and judgment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>Of the call of Samuel.</strong></p>

<p>Lastly so far has this opinion been shown to be pleasing to God that we see that this system not without reason finds a place in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, so that the Lord would not of Himself instruct by the method of a Divine colloquy the lad Samuel, when chosen for judgment, but suffered him to run once or twice to the old man, and willed that one whom He was calling to converse with Him should be taught even by one who had offended <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as he was an old man, and preferred that he whom He had deemed worthy to be called by Him should be trained by the Elder in order to test the humility of him who was called to a Divine office, and to set an example to the younger men by the manner of his subjection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>Of the call of the Apostle Paul.</strong></p>

<p>And when Christ in His own Person called and addressed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, although He might have opened out to him at once the way of perfection, yet He chose rather to direct him to Ananias and commanded him to learn the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from him, saying: <q>Arise and go into the city and there it shall be told you what you ought to do.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351193"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse6">Acts&nbsp;9:6</a></span> So He sends him to an older man, and thinks good to have him instructed by his teaching rather than His own, lest what might have been rightly done in the case of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> might set a bad example of self-sufficiency, if each one were to persuade himself that he also ought in like manner to be trained by the government and teaching of God alone rather than by the instruction of the Elders. And this self-sufficiency the apostle himself teaches, not only by his letters but by his acts and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, ought to be shunned with all possible care, as he says that he went up to Jerusalem solely for this reason; viz., to communicate in a private and informal conference with his co-apostles and those who were before him that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which he preached to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> accompanying him with powerful signs and wonders: as he says <q>And I communicated with them the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which I preach among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> lest perhaps I had run or should run in vain.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351194"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse2">Galatians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> Who then is so self-sufficient and blind as to dare to trust in his own judgment and discretion when the chosen vessel confesses that he had need of conference with his fellow <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Whence we clearly see that the Lord does not Himself show the way of perfection to anyone who having the opportunity of learning depises the teaching and training of the Elders, paying no heed to that saying which ought most carefully to be observed: <q>Ask your father and he will show it to you: your Elders and they will tell you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351195"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse7">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:7</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>How to seek for discretion.</strong></p>

<p>We ought then with all our might to strive for the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of discretion by the power of humility, as it will keep us uninjured by either extreme, for there is an old saying <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BA;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C2; &#x1F30;&#x03C3;&#x1F79;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C2;</span>, i.e., extremes meet. For excess of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> come to the same thing, and an unlimited continuance of <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> is equally injurious to a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> as the torpor of a deep sleep: for when a man is weakened by excessive abstinence he is sure to return to that condition in which a man is kept through carelessness and negligence, so that we have often seen those who could not be deceived by <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, destroyed by excessive <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and by reason of weakness liable to that passion which they had before overcome. Unreasonable <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> and nightly watchings have also been the ruin of some whom sleep could not get the better of: wherefore as the apostle says <q>with the arms of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351196"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:7</a></span> we pass on with due moderation, and walk between the two extremes, under the guidance of discretion, that we may not consent to be led away from the path of continence marked out for us, nor fall by undue carelessness into the pleasures of the palate and belly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p><strong>On excessive fasts and vigils.</strong></p>

<p>For I remember that I had so often resisted the desire for food, that having abstained from taking any for two or three days, my mind was not troubled even by the recollection of any eatables and also that sleep was by the assaults of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> so far removed from my eyes, that for several days and nights I used to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the Lord to grant a little sleep to my eyes; and then I felt that I was in greater peril from the want of food and sleep than from struggling against sloth and <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>. And so as we ought to be careful not to fall into dangerous effeminacy through desire for bodily gratification, nor indulge ourselves with eating before the right time nor take too much, so also we ought to refresh ourselves with food and sleep at the proper time even if we dislike it. For the struggle in each case is caused by the devices of the enemy; and excessive abstinence is still more injurious to us than careless satiety: for from this latter the intervention of a healthy compunction will raise us to the right measure of strictness, and not from the former.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p><strong>A question on the right measure of abstinence and refreshment.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: What then is the measure of abstinence by keeping which with even balance we shall succeed in passing unharmed between the two extremes?</p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p><strong>Of the best plan for our daily food.</strong></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: On this matter we are aware that there have been frequent discussions among our Elders. For in discussing the abstinence of some who supported their lives continually on nothing but beans or only on vegetables and fruits, they proposed to all of them to partake of bread alone, the right measure of which they fixed at two biscuits, so small that they assuredly scarcely weighed a pound.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p><strong>An objection on the ease of that abstinence in which a man is sustained by two biscuits.</strong></p>

<p>And this we gladly embraced, and answered that we should scarcely consider this limit as abstinence, as we could not possibly reach it entirely.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p><strong>The answer concerning the value and measure of well-proved abstinence.</strong></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: If you want to test the force of this rule, keep to this limit continually, never departing from it by taking any cooked food even on Sunday or Saturday, or on the occasions of the arrival of any of the brethren; for the flesh, refreshed by these exceptions, is able not only to support itself through the rest of the week on a smaller quantity, but can also postpone all refreshment without difficulty, as it is sustained by the addition of that food which it has taken beyond the limit; while the man who has always been satisfied with the full amount of the above-mentioned measure will never be able to do this, nor to put off breaking his fast till the morrow. For I remember that our Elders (and I recollect that we ourselves also often had the same experience) found it so hard and difficult to practise this abstinence, and observed the rule laid down with such pain and hunger that it was almost against their will and with tears and lamentation that they set this limit to their meals.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p><strong>What is the usual limit both of abstinence and of partaking food.</strong></p>

<p>But this is the usual limit of abstinence; viz., for everyone to allow himself food according to the requirements of his strength or bodily frame or age, in such quantity as is required for the support of the flesh, and not for the satisfactory feeling of repletion. For on both sides a man will suffer the greatest injury, if having no fixed rule at one time he pinches his stomach with meagre food and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, and at another stuffs it by over-eating himself; for as the mind which is enfeebled for lack of food loses vigour in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, while it is worn out with excessive weakness of the flesh and forced to doze, so again when weighed down with over-eating it cannot pour forth to God pure and free <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>: nor will it succeed in preserving uninterruptedly the purity of its <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, while even on those days on which it seems to chastise the flesh with severer abstinence, it feeds the fire of carnal desire with the fuel of the food that it has already taken.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p><strong>Quemadmodum abundantia umorum genitalium castigetur. </strong></p>

<p>Nam quod semel per escarum abundantian concretus fuerit in medullis, necesse est egeri atque ab ipsa natur&aelig; lege propelli, qu&aelig; exuberantiam cujuslibet umoris superflui velut noxiam sibi atque contrariam in semet ipsa residere non patitur ideoque rationabili semper et &aelig;quali est corpus nostrum parsimonia castigandum, ut si naturali hac necessitate commorantes in carne omnimodis carere non possumus, saltim rarius nos et non amplius quamtrina vice ista conluvione respersos totius anni cursus inveniat, quod tamen sine ullo pruritu quietus egerat sopor, non fallax imago index occult&aelig; voluptatis eliciat.</p>

<p>Wherefore this is the moderate and even allowance and measure of abstinence, of which we spoke, which has the approval also of the judgment of the fathers; viz., that daily hunger should go hand in hand with our daily meals, preserving both body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in one and the same condition, and not allowing the mind either to faint through weariness from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, nor to be oppressed by over-eating, for it ends in such a sparing diet that sometimes a man neither notices nor remembers in the evening that he has broken his fast.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p><strong>Of the difficulty of uniformity in eating; and of the gluttony of brother Benjamin.</strong></p>

<p>And so far is this not done without difficulty, that those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of perfect discretion would rather prolong their <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> for two days, and reserve for tomorrow what they should have eaten today, so that when they come to partake of food they may enjoy as much as they can desire. &nbsp;And you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that lastly your fellow citizen Benjamin most obstinately stuck to this: as he would not every day partake of his two biscuits, nor, continually take his meagre fare with uniform self-discipline, but preferred always to continue his <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> for two days that when he came to eat he might fill his greedy stomach with a double portion, and by eating four biscuits enjoy a comfortable sense of repletion, and manage to fill his belly by means of a two days' fast. And you doubtless remember what sort of an end there was to the life of this man who obstinately and pertinaciously relied on his own judgment rather than on the traditions of the Elders, for he forsook the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> and returned back to the vain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of this world and earthly vanities, and so confirmed the above mentioned opinion of the Elders by the example of his downfall, and by his destruction teaches a lesson that no one who trusts in his own opinion and judgment can possibly climb the heights of perfection, nor fail to be deceived by the dangerous wiles of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p><strong>A question how is it possible always to observe one and the same measure.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: How then can we observe this measure without ever breaking it? For sometimes at the ninth hour when the Station fast  is over, brethren come to see us and then we must either for their sakes add something to our fixed and customary portion, or certainly fail in that courtesy which we are told to show to everybody.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p><strong>The answer how we should not exceed the proper measure of food.</strong></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Both duties must be observed in the same way and with equal care: for we ought most scrupulously to preserve the proper allowance of food for the sake of our abstinence, and in like manner out of charity to show courtesy and encouragement to any of the brethren who may arrive; because it is absolutely ridiculous when you offer food to a brother, nay, to Christ Himself, not to partake of it with him, but to make yourself a stranger to his repast. And so we shall keep clear of guilt on either hand if we observe this plan; viz., at the ninth hour to partake of one of the two biscuits which form our proper canonical allowance, and to keep back the other to the evening, in expectation of something like this, that if any of the brethren comes to see us we may partake of it with him, and so add nothing to our own customary allowance: and by this arrangement the arrival of our brother which ought to be a pleasure to us will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us no inconvenience: since we shall show him the civilities which courtesy requires in such a way as to relax nothing of the strictness of our abstinence. But if no one should come, we may freely take this last biscuit as belonging to us according to our canonical rule, and by this frugality of ours as a single biscuit was taken at the ninth hour, our stomach will not be overloaded at eventide, a thing which is often the case with those who under the idea that they are observing a stricter abstinence put off all their repast till evening; for the fact that we have but recently taken food hinders our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from being bright and keen both in our evening and in our nocturnal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and so at the ninth hour a convenient and suitable time has been allowed for food, in which a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> can refresh himself and so find that he is not only fresh and bright during his nocturnal <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, but also perfectly ready for his evening <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, as his food is already digested.</p>

<p>With such a banquet of two courses, as it were, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> feasted us, showing us not only the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and power of discretion by his present learned speech, but also the method of renunciation and the end and aim of the monastic life by the discussion previously held; so as to make clearer than daylight what we had hitherto pursued simply with fervour of spirit and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for God but with closed eyes, and to make us feel how far we had up till then wandered from purity of heart and the straight line of our course, since the practice of all visible arts belonging to this life cannot possibly stand without an understanding of their aim, nor can it be taken in hand without a clear view of a definite end.</p>
