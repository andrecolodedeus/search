<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>CONFERENCE OF ABBOT PINUFIUS. ON THE END OF PENITENCE AND THE MARKS OF SATISFACTION.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>Of the humility of Abbot Pinufius, and of his hiding-place.</strong></p>

<p>Now that I am going to relate the precepts of that excellent and remarkable man, Abbot Pinufius, on the end of penitence, I fancy that I can dispose of a very large part of my material, if out of consideration lest I weary my reader, I here pass over in silence the praise of his humility, which I touched on in a brief discourse in the fourth book of the Institutes,  which was entitled <q>Of the rules to be observed by renunciants,</q> especially as many who have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that work, may happen to read this, and then all the authority of the utterances will be weakened if there is no account of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the speaker. For this man when he was presiding as Abbot and Presbyter over a large C&oelig;nobium not far from Panephysis, a city, as was there said, of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and when all that province had praised him to the skies for his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, so that he already seemed to himself to have received the reward of his labours in the remuneration of the praise of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as he was afraid lest the emptiness of popular favour, which he especially disliked, might interfere with the fruits of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward, he secretly fled from his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and made his way to the furthest recesses of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Tabenn&aelig;,  where he chose not the solitude of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, not that freedom from care of which the life of one alone affords, which even those who are imperfect and who cannot endure the effort which <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> requires in the C&oelig;nobium, sometimes seek after with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> presumption, but he chose to submit himself to a most famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Where, however, that he might not be betrayed by any signs of his dress, he clothed himself in a secular garb, and lay before the doors with tears, as is the custom there, for many days, and clinging to the knees of all after being daily repulsed by those who to test his purpose said that now in extreme old age he was seeking this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life not in sincerity, but driven by the lack of food, at last he obtained admission, and there he was told off to help a young brother who had been given the charge of a garden, and when he not only fulfilled with such marvellous and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> humility everything which his chief ordered him or which the care of the work entrusted to him demanded, but also performed in stealthy labour by night certain necessary offices which were avoided by the rest out of disgust for them, so that when morning dawned, all the congregation was delighted at such useful works but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not their author; and when he had passed nearly three years there rejoicing in the labours, which he had desired, but to which he was so unfairly subjected, it happened that a certain brother <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him came there from the same parts of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> from which he himself had come. And this man for a time hesitated because the meanness of his clothes and of his office prevented him from readily recognizing him at once, but after looking very closely at him, fell at his feet, and first astonished all the brethren, and afterwards, when he betrayed his name, which the fame of his special <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> had made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them also, he smote them with sorrow and compunction because they had told off a man of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to such mean offices. But he, shedding copious tears, and charging the accident of his betrayal to the serious <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, was brought in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> custody by his brethren surrounding him to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; and after that he had stayed there for a short time, he was once more troubled by the respect shown to his dignity and rank, and stealthily embarked on board ship and sailed to the Palestinian province of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, where he was received as a beginner and a novice in the house of that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in which we were living, and was charged by the Abbot to stop in our cell. But not even there could his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and merits long remain secret. For he was discovered and betrayed in the same way, and brought back to his own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with the utmost <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and respect.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>Of our coming to him.</strong></p>

<p>When then after no long time a desire for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> instruction had urged us also to visit <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, we sought him out with the utmost eagerness and devotion and were welcomed by him with such kindness and courtesy that he actually honoured us, as former sharers of the same cell with him, with a lodging in his own cell which he had built in the furthest corner of his garden. And there when in the presence of all the brethren at service he had delivered to one of the brethren who was submitting to the rule of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> sufficiently difficult and elevated precepts, which as we said, I summarized as briefly as I could in the fourth book of the Institutes, the heights of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> renunciation seemed to us so unattainable and so marvellous that we did not think that such <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> folks as we could ever scale them. And therefore, cast down in despair, and not concealing in our looks the inner bitterness of our thoughts, we came back to the blessed old man with a tolerably anxious heart: and when he at once asked the reason why we were so sad, Abbot Germanus groaned deeply and replied as follows.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>A question on the end of penitence and the marks of satisfaction.</strong></p>

<p>As your grand and splendid exposition of a doctrine new to us has opened out to us a more difficult road to the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> renunciation,  and has removed the scales from our eyes, and shown to us its summit raised in the heavens, so are we proportionately cast down with a greater weight of despair. Since, when we measure its vastness against our puny strength, and compare the excessively <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> character of our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> with the boundless height of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> shown to us, we feel that we are so small that we not only cannot attain to it, but that we are sure to fall short in what we have. For as we are weighed down by the burden of excessive despair, we fall away somehow from the lowest depths to still lower ones. Accordingly there is one and only one support which can provide a cure for our wounds; viz., for us to learn something of the end of penitence and especially on the marks of satisfaction, that we may feel sure of the forgiveness of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and so be spurred on to scale the heights of the perfection described above.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>The answer on the humility shown by our request.</strong></p>

<p>Pinufius: I am indeed delighted at the very plentiful fruits of your humility, which indeed I saw with no indifferent concern, when I was formerly received in the habitation of that cell of yours, and I am very glad that you welcome with such respect the charge given by us, the least of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and the words that I have taken the liberty of saying so that if I am not mistaken you carry them out as soon as ever they are spoken by us; and though, as I remember, the importance of the words scarcely deserves the efforts you bestow on them, yet you so conceal the merits of your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as if no breath ever reached you of those things which you are daily practising. But because this fact is worthy of the highest praise; viz., that you declare that those institutes of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are still unknown to you as if you were still beginners we will, as briefly as possible, summarize what you so eagerly ask of us. For we must even beyond our powers and ability, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the commands of such old friends as you. And so on the value and appeasing power of penitence many have published a great deal, not only in words but also in writing, showing how useful it is, how strong, and full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so that when God is offended by our past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and on the point of inflicting a most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment for such offenses, it somehow, if it is not wrong to say so, stops Him, and, if I may so say, stays the right hand of the Avenger even against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But I have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that all this is well known to you, either from your natural wisdom, or from your unwearied study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, so that from this the first shoots, so to speak, of your conversion sprang up. Finally, you are anxious not about the character of penitence but about its end, and the marks of satisfaction, and so by a very shrewd question ask what has been left out by others.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>Of the method of penitence and the proof of pardon.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore in order to satisfy as briefly and shortly as possible, your desire and question, the full and perfect description of penitence is, never again to yield to those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> for which we do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, or for which our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is pricked. But the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of satisfaction and pardon is for us to have expelled the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of them from our hearts. For each one may be sure that he is not yet free from his former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as long as any image of those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he has committed or of others like them dances before his eyes, and I will not say a delight in&mdash; but the recollection of&mdash; them haunts his inmost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> while he is devoting himself to satisfaction for them and to tears. And so one who is on the watch to make satisfaction may then feel sure that he is free from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and that he has obtained pardon for past faults, when he never feels that his heart is stirred by the allurements and imaginations of these same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Wherefore the truest test of penitence and <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of pardon is found in our own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, which even before the day of judgment and of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, while we are still in the flesh, discloses our acquittal from guilt, and reveals the end of satisfaction and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of forgiveness. And that what has been said may be more significantly expressed, then only should we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the stains of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven us, when the desires for present delights as well as the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> have been expelled from our heart.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>A question whether our sins ought to be remembered out of contrition of heart.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: And whence can there be aroused in us this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and salutary contrition from humiliation, which is described as follows in the person of the penitent: <q>I have acknowledged my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and mine unrighteousness have I not hid. I said: I will acknowledge against myself mine unrighteousness to the Lord,</q> so that we may be able effectually to say also what follows: <q>And You forgave the iniquity of my heart;</q>  or how, when we kneel in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall we be able to stir ourselves up to tears of confession, by which we may be able to obtain pardon for our offenses, according to these words: <q>Every night will I wash my bed: I will water my couch with tears;</q>  if we expel from our hearts all recollection of our faults, though on the contrary we are bidden carefully to preserve the remembrance of them, as the Lord says: <q>And your iniquities I will not remember: but do you recollect them?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352121"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse25">Isaiah&nbsp;43:25-26</a></span> Wherefore not only when I am at work, but also when I am at <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> I try of set purpose to recall to my mind the recollection of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that I may be more effectually inclined to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humility and contrition of heart, and venture to say with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Look upon my humility and my labour: and forgive me all my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>The answer showing how far we ought to preserve the recollection of previous actions.</strong></p>

<p>Pinufius: Your question, as has been already said above, was not raised with regard to the character of penitence, but with regard to its end, and the marks of satisfaction: to which, as I think, a fair and pertinent reply has been given. But what you have said as to the remembrance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is sufficiently useful and needful to men who are still doing penance, that they may with constant smiting of the breast say: <q>For I acknowledge my <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>: and my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is ever before me;</q> and this too: <q>And I will think for my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  While then we do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, and are still grieved by the recollection of faulty actions, the shower of tears which is caused by the confession of our faults is sure to quench the fire of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. But when, while a man is still in this state of humility of heart and contrition of spirit and continuing to labour and to weep, the remembrance of these things fades away, and the thorns of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> are by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> extracted from his inmost heart, then it is clear that he has attained to the end of satisfaction and the reward of pardon, and that he is purged from the stain of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he has committed. To which state of forgetfulness we can only attain by the obliteration of our former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and likings, and by perfect and complete purity of heart. And this most certainly will not be attained by any of those who from sloth or carelessness have failed to purge out their faults, but only by one who by constantly continuing to groan and sigh sorrowfully has removed every spot of his former stains, and by the goodness of his heart and his labour has proclaimed to the Lord: <q>I have acknowledged my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and mine unrighteousness have I not hid;</q> and: <q>My tears have been my meat day and night;</q> so that in the end it may be vouchsafed to him to hear these words: <q>Let your voice cease from weeping, and your eyes from tears: for there is a reward for your labour, says the Lord;</q>  and these words also may be uttered of him by the voice of the Lord: <q>I have blotted out as a cloud your iniquities, and as a mist your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>:</q> and again: <q>I even I am He that blots out your iniquities for my own sake, and your offenses I will no longer remember;</q>  and so, when he is freed from the <q>cords of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> by which <q>everyone is bound,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352126"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;5:22</a></span> he will with all thanksgiving sing to the Lord: <q>You have broken my chains: I will offer to you the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>Of the various fruits of penitence.</strong></p>

<p>For after that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is common to all, and that most precious gift of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> which is gained by being washed in blood, there are many fruits of penitence by which we can succeed in expiating our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is not only promised to the bare fact of penitence, of which the blessed Apostle Peter says: <q>Repent and be converted that your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be forgiven;</q> and John the Baptist and the Lord Himself: <q>Repent, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand:</q>  but also by the affection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the weight of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> overwhelmed: for <q>charity covers a multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352129"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:8</a></span> In the same way also by the fruits of almsgiving a remedy is provided for our wounds, because <q>As water extinguishes fire, so does almsgiving extinguish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352130"><a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse33">Sirach&nbsp;3:33</a></span> So also by the shedding of tears is gained the washing away of offenses, for <q>Every night I will wash my bed: I will water my couch with tears.</q> Finally to show that they are not shed in vain, he adds: <q>Depart from me all you that work iniquity, for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping:</q>  Moreover by means of confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, their absolution is granted: for <q>I said: I will confess against myself my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the Lord: and You forgave the iniquity of my heart;</q> and again: <q>Declare your iniquities first, that you may be justified.</q>  By afflicting the heart and body also is forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed in like manner obtained, for he says: <q>Look on my humility and my labour, and forgive me all my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;</q> and more especially by amendment of life: <q>Take away,</q> he says, <q>the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of your thoughts from my eyes. Cease to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, learn to do well. Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed: judge the orphan, defend the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. And come, reason with Me, says the Lord: and though your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were as scarlet, yet shall they be as white as snow, though they were red as crimson, they shall be as white as wool.</q>  Sometimes too the pardon of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is obtained by the intercession of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, for <q>if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his brother to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not unto death, he asks, and He will give to him his life, for him that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not unto death;</q> and again: <q>Is any sick among you? Let him send for the Elders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and they shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he be in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, they shall be forgiven him.</q>  Sometimes too by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of compassion and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the stains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are removed, according to this passage: <q>By compassion and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are purged away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352135"><a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse27">Proverbs&nbsp;15:27</a></span> And often by the conversion and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those who are saved by our warnings and preaching: <q>For he who converts a sinner from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his way, shall save his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from death, and cover a multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352136"><a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse20">James&nbsp;5:20</a></span> Moreover by pardon and forgiveness on our part we obtain pardon of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: <q>For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352137"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;6:14</a></span> You see then what great means of obtaining mercy the compassion of our Saviour has laid open to us, so that no one when longing for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> need be crushed by despair, as he sees himself called to life by so many remedies. For if you plead that owing to weakness of the flesh you cannot get rid of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and you cannot say: <q>My knees are weak from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and my flesh is changed for oil; for I have eaten ashes for my bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,</q>  then atone for them by profuse almsgiving. If you have nothing that you can give to the needy (although the claims of want and poverty exclude none from this office, since the two mites of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> are ranked higher than the splendid gifts of the rich, and the Lord promises that He will give a reward for a cup of cold water), at least you can purge them away by amendment of life. But if you cannot secure perfection in goodness by the eradication of all your faults, you can show a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> anxiety for the good and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of another. But if you complain that you are not equal to this service, you can cover your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by the affection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And if in this also some sluggishness of mind makes you weak, at least you should submissively with a feeling of humility entreat for remedies for your wounds by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and intercession of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Finally who is there who cannot humbly say: <q>I have acknowledged my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid;</q> so that by this confession he may be able also to add this: <q>And You forgave the iniquity of my heart.</q>  But if shame holds you back, and you blush to reveal them before men, you should not cease to confess them with constant supplication to Him from Whom they cannot be hid, and to say to Him: <q>I acknowledge mine iniquity, and my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is ever before me. Against You only have I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before You;</q>  as He is wont to heal them without any publication which brings shame, and to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without any reproaching. And further besides that ready and sure aid the Divine condescension has afforded us another also that is still easier, and has entrusted the possession of the remedy to our own will, so that we can infer from our own feelings the forgiveness of our offenses, when we say to Him: <q>Forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352141"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> Whoever then desires to obtain forgiveness of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, should study to fit himself for it by these means. Let not the stubbornness of an obdurate heart turn away any from the saving remedy and the fount of so much goodness, because even if we have done all these things, they will not be able to expiate our offenses, unless they are blotted out by the goodness and mercy of the Lord, who when He sees the service of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> efforts offered by us with a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> heart, supports our small and puny efforts with the utmost bounty, and says: <q>I even I am He that blots out your iniquities for My own sake, and I will remember your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> no more.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352142"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse25">Isaiah&nbsp;43:25</a></span> Whoever then is aiming at this condition, which we have mentioned, will seek the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of satisfaction by daily <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and mortification of heart and body, for, as it is written, <q>Without shedding of blood there is no remission;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352143"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse22">Hebrews&nbsp;9:22</a></span> and this not without good reason.

And so he will begin to weep no more at the recollection of former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but at the hope of what is to come, and, thinking less of past <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> than of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come, will shed tears not from sorrow at his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but from delight in that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and <q>forgetting those things which are behind,</q> i.e., carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, will press on <q>to those before,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352147"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> i.e., to spiritual gifts and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>How valuable to the perfect is the forgetfulness of sin.</strong></p>

<p>But with regard to this that you said a little way back; viz., that you of set purpose go over the recollections of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, this ought certainly not to be done, nay, if it forcibly surprises you, it must be at once expelled. For it greatly hinders the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of purity, and especially in the case of one who is living in solitude, as it entangles him in the stains of this world and swamps him in foul <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For while you are recalling those things which you did through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or wantonness in accordance with the prince of this world, though I grant you that while you are engaged in these thoughts no delight in them steals in, yet at least the mere taint of the ancient filthiness is sure to corrupt your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with its foul stink, and to shut out the spiritual fragrance of goodness, i.e., the odour of a sweet savour. When then the recollection of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> comes over your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, you must recoil from it just as an honest and upright man runs away if he is sought out in public by an immodest and wanton <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> either by words or by embraces. And certainly unless he at once withdraws himself from contact with her, and if he allows himself to linger the very least in impure talk, even if he refuses his consent to the shameful pleasures, yet he cannot avoid the brand of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> and scorn in the judgment of all the passers by. So then we also, if by noxious recollections we are led to thoughts of this kind, ought at once to desist from dwelling upon them and to fulfil what we are commanded by Solomon: <q>But go forth,</q> says he, <q>do not linger in her place, nor fix your eye on her;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352148"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse18">Proverbs&nbsp;9:18</a></span> lest if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> see us taken up with unclean and foul thoughts, they may not be able to say to us in passing by: <q>The blessing of the Lord be upon you.</q>  For it is impossible for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to continue in good thoughts, when the main part of the heart is taken up with foul and earthly considerations. For this saying of Solomon's is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: <q>When your eyes look on a strange <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, then shall your mouth speak wickedly, and you shall lie as it were in the midst of the sea, and as a pilot in a great storm. But you shall say: They have beaten me, but I felt no pain; and they mocked me, but I felt not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352150"><a href="../bible/pro023.htm#verse33">Proverbs&nbsp;23:33-35</a></span> So then we should forsake not only all foul but even all earthly thoughts and ever raise the desires of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to heavenly things, in accordance with this saying of our Saviour: <q>For where I am,</q> He says, <q>there also shall My servant be.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352151"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;12:26</a></span> For it often happens that when anyone out of pity is in thought going over his own falls or those of other faulty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, he is affected by the delight and assent to this most subtle attack, and that which was undertaken and started with a show of goodness ends with a filthy and damaging termination, for <q>there are ways which appear to men to be right, but the ends thereof will come to the depths of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352152"><a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse25">Proverbs&nbsp;16:25</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>How the recollection of our sins should be avoided.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore we must endeavour to rouse ourselves to this praiseworthy contrition, by aiming at <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and by the desire for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> rather than by dangerous recollections of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for a man is sure to be suffocated by the pestilential smells of the sewer as long as he chooses to stand over it or to stir its filth.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>Of the marks of satisfaction, and the removal of past sins.</strong></p>

<p>But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, as we have often said, that then only have we made satisfaction for past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when the very motions and feelings, through which we were guilty of what we have to sorrow for, have been eradicated from our hearts. But no one should fancy that he can secure this, unless he has first with all the fervour of his spirit cut off the opportunities and occasions, owing to which he fell into those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; as for instance, if through dangerous familiarity with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> he has fallen into fornication or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, he must take the utmost pains to avoid even looking on one; or if he has been overcome by too much wine and over-eating, he should chastise with the utmost severity his craving for immoderate food. And again if he has been led astray by the desire for and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, and has fallen into <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> or theft or <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> or <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, he should cut off the occasion for <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, which has allured and deceived him. If he is driven by the passion of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> into the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, he should with all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of humility, remove the incentive to arrogance. And so, in order that each single <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be destroyed, the occasion and opportunity by which or for which it was committed should be first got rid of. For by this curative treatment we can certainly attain to forgetfulness of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> we have committed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>Wherein we must do penance for a time only; and wherein it can have no end.</strong></p>

<p>But that description of the forgetfulness spoken of only has to do with capital offenses, which are also condemned by the mosaic law, the inclination to which is destroyed and put an end to by a good life, and so also the penance for them has an end. But for those small offenses in which, as it is written, <q>the righteous falls seven times and will rise again</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352153"><a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse16">Proverbs&nbsp;24:16</a></span> penitence will never cease. For either through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or forgetfulness, or thought, or word, or surprise, or necessity, or weakness of the flesh, or defilement in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, we often fall every day either against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> or voluntarily; offenses for which David also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> the Lord, and asks for purification and pardon, and says: <q>Who can understand <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? From my secret ones cleanse me; and from those of others spare Your servant;</q>  and the Apostle: <q>For the good which I would I do not, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which I would not, that I do.</q> For which also the same man exclaims with a sigh <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</q>  For we slip into these so easily as it were by a law of nature, that however carefully and guardedly we are on the lookout against them, we cannot altogether avoid them. Since it was of these that one of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, whom Jesus loved, declared and laid down absolutely saying: <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we deceive ourselves, and His word is not in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352156"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8,&nbsp;10</a></span> Further for a man who is anxious to reach the heights of perfection it will not greatly help him to have arrived at the end of penitence, i.e., to restrain himself from unlawful acts, unless he has always urged himself forward in unwearied course to those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> whereby we come to the signs of satisfaction. For it will not be enough for a man to have kept himself clear from those foul stains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which the Lord <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, unless he has also secured by purity of heart and perfect Apostolical <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that sweet fragrance of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in which the Lord delights. Thus far Abbot Pinufius discoursed on the marks of satisfaction and the end of penitence. And although he pressed us with anxious <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to decide to stay in his C&oelig;nobium, yet when he could not retain us, as we were incited by the fame of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Scete, he sent us on our way.</p>
