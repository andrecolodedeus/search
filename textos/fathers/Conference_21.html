<h1>Conference 21</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT THEONAS. ON THE RELAXATION DURING THE FIFTY DAYS.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>How Theonas came to Abbot John.</strong></p>

<p>Before we begin to set forth the words of this Conference held with that excellent man Abbot Theonas,  I think it well to describe in a brief discourse the origin of his conversion because from this the reader will be able to see more clearly both the excellence and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the man. He then while still very young was by the desire and command of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> joined in the tie of marriage, for as with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> anxiety they were careful about his <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and were afraid of a critical fall at a dangerous age, they thought that the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of youth might be anticipated by the remedy of a lawful marriage. When then he had lived for five years with a wife, he came to Abbot John, who was then for his marvellous <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> chosen to preside over the administration of the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.  For it is not anyone who likes who is of his own wish or ambition promoted to this office, but only he whom the congregation of all the Elders considers from the advantage of his age and the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to be more excellent than, and superior to, all others. To this blessed John then the aforesaid young man had come in the eagerness of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> devotion, bringing gifts of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> among other owners who were eager to offer <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of their substance to the old man I mentioned,  and when the old man saw them pouring in upon him with many gifts, and was anxious to make some recompense in return for their offerings, he began, as the Apostle says, to sow spiritual things to them whose carnal gifts he was reaping. <span class="stiki" id="note352161"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:11</a></span> And finally thus began his word of exhortation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>The exhortation of Abbot John to Theonas and the others who had come together with him.</strong></p>

<p>I am indeed delighted, my children, with the duteous liberality of your gifts; and your devout offering, the disposal of which is entrusted to me, I gratefully accept, because you are offering your firstfruits and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> for the good and use of the needy, as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the Lord, of a sweet smelling savour, in the belief that by the offering of them, the abundance of your fruits and all your substance, from which you have taken away these for the Lord, will be richly blessed, and that you yourselves will according to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of His command be endowed even in this world with manifold richness in all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things: <q>Honour the Lord from your righteous labours, and offer to Him of the fruits of your righteousness; that your garners may be full of abundance of wheat, and your vats may overflow with wine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352162"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse9">Proverbs&nbsp;3:9-10</a></span> And as you are faithfully carrying out this service, you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you have fulfilled the righteousness of the old law, under which those who then lived if they transgressed it inevitably incurred guilt, while if they fulfilled it they could not attain to a pitch of perfection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>Of the offering of tithes and firstfruits.</strong></p>

<p>For indeed by the Lord's command <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the service of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, but oblations and firstfruits for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.  But this was the law of the firstfruits; viz., that the fiftieth part of fruits or animals should be given for the service of the temple and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: and this proportion some who were faithlessly indifferent diminished, while those who were very religious increased it, so that the one gave only the sixtieth part, and the other gave the fortieth part of their fruits. For the righteous, for whom the law is not enacted, are thus shown to be not under the law, as they try not only to fulfil but even to exceed the righteousness of the law, and their devotion is greater than the legal requirement, as it goes beyond the observance of precepts and adds to what is due of its own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>How Abraham, David, and other saints went beyond the requirement of the law.</strong></p>

<p>For so we read that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> went beyond the requirement of the law which was afterwards to be given, when after his victory over the four kings, he would not touch any of the spoils of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, which were fairly due to him as the conqueror, and which indeed the king himself, whose spoils he had rescued, offered him; and with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by the Divine name he exclaimed: <q>I lift up my hand to the Lord Most High, who made heaven and earth, that I will not take from a thread to a shoe's latchet of all that is yours.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352164"><a href="../bible/gen014.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;14:22-23</a></span> So we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that David went beyond the requirement of the law, as, though <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commanded that vengeance should be taken on enemies, <span class="stiki" id="note352165"><a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse24">Exodus&nbsp;21:24</a></span> he not only did not do this, but actually embraced his persecutors with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and piously entreated the Lord for them, and wept bitterly and avenged them when they were slain. So we are sure that Elijah and Jeremiah were not under the law, as though they might without blame have taken advantage of lawful matrimony, yet they preferred to remain <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. So we read that Elisha and others of the same mode of life went beyond the commands of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as of them the Apostle speaks as follows: <q>They went about in sheepskins and in goatskins, they were oppressed, afflicted, in want, of whom the world was not worthy, they wandered about in deserts and in mountains, and in caves and in dens of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352166"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse37">Hebrews&nbsp;11:37-38</a></span> What shall I say of the sons of Jonadab the son of <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a>, of whom we are told that, when at the Lord's bidding the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah offered them wine, they replied: <q>We drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a>, our father, commanded us, saying: You shall drink no wine, you and your sons forever: and you shall build no house, nor sow any seed, nor plant vineyards nor possess them: but you shall dwell in tents all your days</q>? Wherefore also they were permitted to hear from the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> these words: <q>Thus says the Lord God of hosts, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: there shall not fail a man from the stock of Jonadab the son of <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a> to stand in My sight all the days;</q>  as all of them were not satisfied with merely offering <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of their possessions, but actually refused property, and offered the rather to God themselves and their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, for which no redemption can be made by man, as the Lord testifies in the gospel: <q>For what shall a man give in exchange for his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352168"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;16:25</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>How those who live under the grace of the Gospel ought to go beyond the requirement of the law.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore we ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we from whom the requirements of the law are no longer exacted, but in whose ears the word of the gospel daily sounds: <q>If you will be perfect, go and sell all that you have and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and you shall have treasure in heaven, and come follow Me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352169"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21</a></span> when we offer to God <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of our substance, are still in a way ground down beneath the burden of the law, and not able to rise to those heights of the gospel, those who conform to which are recompensed not only by blessings in this present life, but also by future rewards. For the law promises to those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> it no rewards of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, but only solaces in this life, saying: <q>The man that does these things shall live in them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352170"><a href="../bible/lev018.htm#verse5">Leviticus&nbsp;18:5</a></span> But the Lord says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>;</q> and: <q>Everyone that leaves house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or field for My name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q>  And this with good reason. For it is not so praiseworthy for us to abstain from forbidden as from lawful things, and not to use these last out of reverence for Him, Who has permitted us to use them because of our weakness. And so if even those who, faithfully offering <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of their fruits, are <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the more ancient precepts of the Lord, cannot yet climb the heights of the gospel, you can see very clearly how far short of it those fall who do not even do this. For how can those men be partakers of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the gospel who disregard the fulfilment even of the lighter commands of the law, to the easy character of which the weighty words of the giver of the law bear testimony, as a curse is actually invoked on those who do not fulfil them; for it says: <q>Cursed is everyone that does not continue in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352172"><a href="../bible/deu027.htm#verse26">Deuteronomy&nbsp;27:26</a></span> But here on account of the superiority and excellence of the commandments it is said: <q>He that can receive it, let him receive it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352173"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;19:12</a></span> There the forcible compulsion of the lawgiver shows the easy character of the precepts; for he says: <q>I call heaven and earth to record against you this day, that if you do not keep the commandments of the Lord your God you shall perish from off the face of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352174"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse26">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:26</a></span> Here the grandeur of sublime commands is shown by the very fact that He does not <em>order</em>, but <em>exhorts</em>, saying: <q>if you will be perfect go</q> and do this or that. There <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> lays a burden that cannot be refused on those who are unwilling: here <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> meets with counsels those who are willing and eager for perfection. For that was not to be enjoined as a general charge, nor to be required, if I may so say, as a regular rule from all, which could not be secured by all, owing to its wonderful and lofty nature; but by counsels all are rather stimulated to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that those who are great may deservedly be crowned by the perfection of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, while those who are small, and not able to come up to <q>the measure of the stature of the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352175"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> although they seem to be lost to sight and hidden as it were by the brightness of larger stars, may yet be free from the darkness of the curses which are in the law, and not adjudged to suffer present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> or visited with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment. Christ therefore does not constrain anyone, by the compulsion of a command, to those lofty heights of goodness, but stimulates them by the power of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and urges them on by wise counsels and the desire of perfection. For where there is a command, there is duty, and consequently punishment. But those who keep those things to which they are driven by the severity of the law established escape the punishment with which they were threatened, instead of obtaining rewards and a recompense.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>How the grace of the gospel supports the weak so that they can obtain pardon, as it secures to the perfect the kingdom of God.</strong></p>

<p>And as the word of the gospel raises those that are strong to sublime and lofty heights, so it suffers not the weak to be dragged down to the depths, for it secures to the perfect the fullness of blessing, and brings to those who are overcome through weakness pardon. For the law placed those who fulfilled its commands in a sort of middle state between what they deserved in either case, severing them from the condemnation due to transgressors, as it also kept them away from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the perfect. But how wretched and miserable this is, you can see from comparing the state of this present life, in which it is considered a very poor thing for a man to sweat and labour only to avoid being regarded as guilty among good men, not also to be esteemed rich and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and renowned.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>How it lies in our own power to choose whether to remain under the grace of the gospel or under the terror of the law.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore it lies today in our own power whether we choose to live under the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the gospel or under the terrors of the law: for each man must incline to one side or the other in accordance with the character of his actions, for either the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ welcomes those who go beyond the law, or else the law keeps its hold over the weaker ones as those who are its debtors and within its clutches. For one who is guilty as regards the precepts of the law will never be able to attain to the perfection of the gospel, even though he idly boasts that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and freed by the Lord's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: for we must not only regard as still under the law the man who refuses to fulfil what the law enjoins, but the man as well who is satisfied with the mere observance of what the law commands, and who never brings forth fruits worthy of his vocation and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, where it is not said: <q>You shall offer to the Lord your God your <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and firstfruits;</q> but: <q>Go and sell all that you have and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and come follow Me;</q>  where, owing to the grandeur of perfection, to the request of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> there is not granted even the very short space of an hour in which to bury his father,  as the offices of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> charity are outweighed by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>How Theonas exhorted his wife that she too should make her renunciation.</strong></p>

<p>And when he had heard this the blessed Theonas was fired with an uncontrollable desire for the perfection of the gospel, and, committed, as it were, the seed of the word, which he had received in a fruitful heart, to the deep and broken furrows of his bosom, as he was greatly humiliated and conscience-stricken because the old man had said not only that he had failed to attain to the perfection of the gospel, but also that he had scarcely fulfilled the commands of the law; since though he was accustomed every year to pay the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of his fruits as <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, yet he mourned that he had never even heard of the law of the firstfruits; and even if he had in the same way fulfilled this, he humbly confessed that still he would in the old man's view have been very far from the perfection of the gospel. And so he returned home sad and filled with that sorrow which works repentance unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note352178"><a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:10</a></span> and of his own will and determination turns all his wife's care and anxiety of mind towards <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and began to stir her up to the same eager desire with which he himself had been inflamed, with the same sort of exhortations, and with tears day and night to urge her that together they might serve God in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, telling her that their conversion to a better life ought not to be deferred because a vain hope in their youth would be no argument against the inevitableness of a sudden death, which carries off boys and youths and young <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> equally with old men.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>How he fled to a monastery when his wife would not consent.</strong></p>

<p>And when his wife was hard and would not consent to him as he constantly persisted with entreaties of this kind, but said that as she was in the flower of her age she could not altogether do without the solace of her husband, and further that supposing she was deserted by him and fell into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the guilt would rather be his who had broken the bonds of wedlock: to this he, when he had for a long while urged the condition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (which being so weak and uncertain, it would be dangerous for it to be any longer mixed up with carnal desires and works), added the assertion that it was not right for anyone to cut himself off from that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to which he had learned that he ought by all means to cleave, and that it was more dangerous to disregard goodness when discovered, than to fail to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it before it was discovered; further that he was already involved in the guilt of a fall if when he had discovered such grand and heavenly blessings he had preferred earthly and mean ones. Further that the grandeur of perfection was open to every age and either sex, and that all the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were urged to scale the heights of heavenly goodness when the Apostle said: <q>So run that you may obtain;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352179"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:24</a></span> nor should those who were ready and eager for it hang back because of the delays of the slow and dawdlers, as it is better for the sluggards to be urged on by those running before than for those who are doing their best to be hampered by the <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a>. Further that he had determined and made up his mind to renounce the world and to die to the world that he might live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that if he could not attain this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; viz., to pass with his wife into union with Christ, he would rather be saved even with the loss of one member, and enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> as one maimed rather than be condemned with his body whole. But he also added and spoke as follows: If <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> suffered wives to be <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> for the hardness of their hearts, why should not Christ allow this for the desire of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, especially when the same Lord among those other affections; viz., for fathers and mothers and children (all due regard to which not only the law but He Himself also charged to be shown, yet for His name's sake and for the desire of perfection He decreed that they should not simply be disregarded but actually <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>)&mdash; to these, I say, He joined also the mention of wives, saying: <q>And everyone that has left house, or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children for My name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352180"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;19:29</a></span> So far then is He from allowing anything to be set against that perfection which He is proclaiming, that He actually enjoins that the ties to father and mother should be broken and disregarded out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Him, though according to the Apostle it is the first commandment with promise; viz., <q>Honour your father and your mother, which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well with you and that your days may be long upon earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352181"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;6:2-3</a></span> And as the word of the gospel condemns those who break the chains of matrimony where there has been no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, so it clearly promises a reward of an hundredfold to those who have cast off a carnal yoke out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Christ and the desire for <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Wherefore if it can be brought about that you may listen to reason and be turned together with me to this most desirable choice; viz., that we should together serve the Lord and escape the pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, I will not refuse the affection of marriage, nay I will embrace it with a still greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For I acknowledge and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> my helpmeet assigned to me by the word of the Lord, and I do not refuse to be joined to her in an unbroken tie of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor do I separate from me what the Lord joined to me by the law of the original condition, <span class="stiki" id="note352182"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;2:18</a></span> if only you yourself will be what your Maker meant you to be. But if you will not be a helpmeet, but prefer to make yourself a deceiver and an assistance not to me but to the adversary, and fancy that the sacrament of matrimony was granted to you for this reason that you may deprive yourself of this <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which is offered to you, and also hold me back from following the Saviour as a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, then I will resolutely lay hold on the words which were uttered by the lips of Abbot John, or rather of Christ Himself, so that no carnal affection may be able to tear me away from spiritual blessings, for He says: <q>He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> not father and mother and children and brothers and sisters and wife and lands, yea and his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also, cannot be My <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352183"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;14:26</a></span> When then by these and such like words the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> purpose was not moved and she persisted in the same obstinate hardness, If, said the blessed Theonas, I cannot drag you away from death, neither shall you separate me from Christ: but it is safer for me to be <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> from a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> person than from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And so by the aid of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> he at once set about the execution of his purpose and suffered not the ardour of his desire to grow cool through any delay. For at once he stripped himself of all his worldly goods, and fled to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, where in a very short time he was so famous for the splendour of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and humility that when John of blessed memory departed this life to the Lord, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Elias, a man who was no less great than his predecessor, had likewise died, Theonas was chosen by the judgment of all as the third to succeed them in the administration of the almsgiving.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>An explanation that we may not appear to recommend separation from wives.</strong></p>

<p>But let no one <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that we have invented this for the sake of encouraging <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, as we not only in no way condemn marriage, but also, following the words of the Apostle, say: <q>Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> in all, and the bed undefiled,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352184"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;13:4</a></span> but it was in order faithfully to show the reader the origin of the conversion by which this great man was dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And I ask the reader kindly, to allow that, whether he likes this or no, in either case I am free from blame, and to give the praise or blame for this act to its real author. But as for me, as I have not put forward an opinion of my own on this matter, but have given a simple narration of the history of the facts, it is fair that as I claim no praise from those who approve of what was done, so I should not be attacked by the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of those who disapprove of it. Let every man therefore, as we said, have his own opinion on the matter. But I advise him to restrain his censure in considering it, lest he come to fancy that he is more just and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> than the Divine judgment, whereby the signs even of Apostolic <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> were conferred upon him (viz., Theonas), not to mention the opinion of such great fathers by whom it is clear that his action was not only not blamed, but even so far praised that in the election to the office of almoner they preferred him to splendid and most excellent men. And I fancy that the judgment of so many spiritual men, uttered with God as its author, was not wrong, as it was, as was said above, confirmed by such wonderful signs.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>An inquiry why in Egypt they do not fast during all the fifty days (of Easter) nor bend their knees in prayer.</strong></p>

<p>But it is now time to follow out the plan of the promised discourse. So then when Abbot Theonas had come to visit us in our cell during Eastertide  after Evensong was over we sat for a little while on the ground and began diligently to consider why they were so very careful that no one should during the whole fifty days either bend his knees in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>  or venture to fast till the ninth hour, and we made our inquiry the more earnestly because we had never seen this custom so carefully observed in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>The answer on the nature of things good, bad, and indifferent.</strong></p>

<p>To this Abbot Theonas thus began his reply. It is indeed right for us, even when we cannot  see the reason, to yield to the authority of the fathers and to a custom of our predecessors that has been continued through so many years down to our own time, and to observe it, as handed down from antiquity, with constant care and reverence. But since you want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the reasons and grounds for this, receive in few words what we have heard as handed down by our Elders on this subject. But before we bring forward the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, we will, if you please, say a little about the nature and character of the fast, that afterwards the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> may support our words. The Divine Wisdom has pointed out in Ecclesiastes that for everything, i.e., for all things <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> or those which are considered unfortunate and unhappy, there is a right time: saying: <q>For all things there is a time, and a time for everything under the heaven. A time to bring forth and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to pull down what is planted; a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to destroy and a time to build; a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance; a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing; a time to get and a time to lose; a time to keep and a time to send away; a time to scatter and a time to collect; a time to be silent and a time to speak; a time to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and a time to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>; a time for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and a time for peace;</q> and below: <q>For there is a time,</q> it says, <q>for everything and for every deed.</q>  None therefore of these things does it lay down as always good, but only when any of them are fittingly done and at the right time, so that these very things which at one time, when done at the right moment, turn out well, if they are ventured on at a wrong or unsuitable time, are found to be useless or harmful; only excepting those things which are in their own nature good or bad, and which cannot ever be made the opposite, as, e.g., <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, or on the other hand, those faults, the description of which cannot possibly be altered or fall under the other head. But those things which can sometimes turn out with either result, so that, in accordance with the character of those who use them, they are found to be either good or bad, these we consider to be not absolutely in their own natures useful or injurious, but only so in accordance with the mind of the doer, and the suitableness of the time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><strong>What kind of good fasting is.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore we must now inquire what we ought to hold about the state of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, whether we meant that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the same sort of way as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which cannot possibly be made anything else, or whether it is something indifferent which sometimes is useful when done, and may be sometimes omitted without condemnation; and which sometimes it is wrong to do, and sometimes laudable to omit. For if we hold <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> to be included in that list of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, so that abstinence from food is placed among those things which are good in themselves, then certainly the partaking of food will be bad and wrong. For whatever is the opposite of that which is in its own nature good, must certainly be held to be in its own nature bad. But this the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> does not allow to us to lay down. For if we fast with such thoughts and intentions, so as to think that we fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by taking food, we shall not only gain no advantage by our abstinence but shall actually contract grievous guilt and fall into the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of impiety, as the Apostle says: <q>Abstaining from meats which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful and those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For every creature of God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and nothing to be refused if it is partaken of with thanksgiving.</q> For <q>if a man thinks that a thing is common, to him it is common.</q>  And therefore we never read that anyone is condemned simply for taking food, but only when something was joined with it or followed afterwards, for which he deserved condemnation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>How fasting is not good in its own nature.</strong></p>

<p>And so that it is a thing indifferent is very clearly shown from this also; viz., because as it brings justification when observed, so it does not bring condemnation when it is broken in upon; unless perhaps the transgression of a command rather than the partaking of food brings punishment. But in the case of a thing that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in its own nature, no time should be without it, in such a way as that a man may do without it, for if it ceases, the man who is careless about it is sure to fall into mischief. Nor again is any time given for what is bad in its own nature, because what is hurtful cannot help hurting, if it is indulged in, nor can it ever be made of a praiseworthy character. And further it is clear that these things, for which we see conditions and times appointed, and which sanctify, when observed without corrupting us when they are neglected, are things indifferent, as, e.g., marriage, agriculture, riches, retirement into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, reading and meditation on <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> itself, from which our discussion took its rise. All of which things the Divine precepts and the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> decreed should not be so incessantly aimed at, or so constantly observed, as for it to be wrong for them to be for a time intermitted. For anything that is absolutely commanded brings death if it be not fulfilled: but whatever things we are urged to rather than commanded, when done are useful, when left undone bring no punishment. And therefore in the case of all or some of these things our predecessors commanded us either to do them with consideration, or to observe them carefully with regard to the reason, place, manner, and time, because if any of them are done suitably, it is fit and convenient, but if incongruously, then it becomes foolish and hurtful. And if at the coming of a brother in whose person he ought to refresh Christ with courtesy and to embrace him with a most kindly welcome, a man should choose to observe a strict fast, would he not rather be guilty of incivility than gain the praise or reward of devoutness? Or if when the failure or weakness of the flesh requires the strength to be restored by the partaking of food, a man will not consent to relax the rigour of his abstinence, is he not to be regarded as a cruel murderer of his own body rather than as one who is careful for his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? So too when a festival season permits a suitable indulgence in food and a necessarily liberal repast, if a man will resolutely cling to the strict observance of a fast he must be considered as not religious so much as boorish and unreasonable. But to those men also will these things be found bad, who are on the lookout for the praises of men by their <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, and by a foolish show of paleness gain credit for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, of whom the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> tells us that they have received their reward in this life, and whose fast the Lord execrates by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. In whose person he first objected to himself and said: <q>Wherefore have we fasted and You have not regarded: wherefore have we humbled our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and You have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it?</q> and then at once he answered and explained the reasons why they did not deserve to be heard: <q>Behold,</q> he says, <q>in the days of your fast your own will is found and you exact of all your debtors. Behold you fast for debates and strife, and strike with the fist wickedly. Do not fast as you have done unto this day, to make your cry to be heard on high. Is this such a fast as I have chosen, for a man to afflict his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for a day? &nbsp;Is it this, to wind his head about like a circle, and to spread sackcloth and ashes? Will you call this a fast and a day acceptable to the Lord?</q> Then he proceeds to teach how the abstinence of one who <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> may become acceptable, and clearly lays down that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> cannot be good of itself alone, but only when it has the following reasons which are added: <q>Is not this,</q> he says, <q>the fast that I have chosen? Loose the bands of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, undo the bundles that oppress, let them that are broken go free, and break asunder every burden. Deal your bread to the hungry, and bring the needy and the harbourless into your house: and when you shall see one naked cover him, and despise not your own flesh. Then shall your light break forth as the morning and your health shall speedily arise, and your righteousness shall go before your face and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord shall gather you up. Then shall you call, and the Lord shall hear: you shall cry, and He shall say, Here am I.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352189"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;58:3-9</a></span> You see then that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is certainly not considered by the Lord as a thing that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in its own nature, because it becomes good and well-pleasing to God not by itself but by other works, and again from the surrounding circumstances it may be regarded as not merely vain but actually hateful, as the Lord says: <q>When they fast I will not hear their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352190"><a href="../bible/jer014.htm#verse12">Jeremiah&nbsp;14:12</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>How a thing that is good in its own nature ought not to be done for the sake of some lesser good.</strong></p>

<p>For we ought not to practise pity, patience and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> mentioned above, wherein there is what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in its own nature, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, but rather <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> for the sake of them. For our endeavour must be that those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are really good may be gained by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, not that the practice of those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> may lead to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> as its end. For this then the affliction of the flesh is useful, for this the remedy of abstinence must be employed; viz., that by it we may succeed in attaining to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, wherein there is what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without change, and continually with no exception of time. For medicines, and the goldsmith's art, and the systems of other arts which there are in this world are not employed for the sake of the instruments which belong to the particular work; but rather the implements are prepared for the practice of the art. And as they are useful for those who understand them, so they are useless to those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the system of the art in question; and as they are a great help to those who rely on their aid for doing their work, so they cannot be of the smallest use to those who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for what purpose they were made, and are contented simply with the possession of them; because they make all their value consist in the mere having of them, and not in the performance of work. That then is in its own nature the best thing, for the sake of which things indifferent are done, but the very chiefest good is done not for the sake of anything else but because of its own intrinsic goodness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>How what is good in its own nature can be distinguished from other things that are good.</strong></p>

<p>And this may be distinguished from those other things which we have termed indifferent, in these ways: if a thing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself and not by reason of something else: if it is useful for its own sake, and not for the sake of something else: if it is unchangeably and at all times good, and always keeps its character and can never become anything different: if its removal or cessation cannot fail to produce the greatest harm: if that which is its opposite is in the same way <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in its own nature, and can never be turned into anything good. And these descriptions by which the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things that are good in themselves can be distinguished, cannot possibly be applied to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, for it is not good of itself, nor useful for its own sake because it is wisely used for the acquisition of purity of heart and body, that the pricks of the flesh being dulled the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be pacified and reconciled to its Creator, nor is it unchangeably and at all times good, because often we are not injured by its intermission, and indeed sometimes if it is unreasonably practised it becomes injurious. Nor is that which seems its opposite <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in its own nature, i.e., the partaking of food, which is naturally agreeable, which cannot be regarded as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, unless intemperance and luxury or some other faults are the result; <q>For not that which enters into the mouth, defiles a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but that which comes out of the mouth, that defiles a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352191"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;15:11</a></span> And so a man disparages what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in its own nature, and does not treat it properly or without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if he does it not for its own sake but for the sake of something else, for everything else should be done for the sake of it, but it should be sought for its own sake alone.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p><strong>Of the reason for fasting and its value.</strong></p>

<p>So then let us constantly remember this description of the character of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and always aim at it with all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in such a way as to recognize that then only is it suitable for us if in it we preserve regard for time, its character and degree, and this not so as to set the end of our hope upon it, but so that by it we may succeed in attaining to purity of heart and Apostolical <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Therefore from this it is clear that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, for which not only are there special seasons appointed at which it should be practised or relaxed, but conditions and rules also laid down, is not good in its own nature, but something indifferent. But those things which are either enjoined as good by the authority of a precept, or are forbidden as bad, are never subject to any exceptions of time in such a way that sometimes we should do what is forbidden or omit what is commanded. For there is no limit set to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, patience, soberness, modesty, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, nor on the other hand is a licence ever granted for <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, impatience, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, immodesty, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p><strong>How fasting is not always suitable.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore as we have premised this on the conditions of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, it seems well to subjoin the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, by which it will be more clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> neither can nor should be always observed. In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> when the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> were <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> together with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of John the Baptist, as the Apostles, as friends and companions of the heavenly Bridegroom, were not yet keeping the observance of a fast, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of John (who thought that they acquired perfect righteousness by their <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, as they were followers of that grand preacher of repentance who afforded a pattern to all the people by his own example, as he not only refused the different  kinds of food which are supplied for man's use, but actually altogether did without eating the bread which is common to all) complained to the Lord and said: <q>Why do we and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> fast oft but your <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> fast not?</q> to whom the Lord in His reply plainly showed that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not suitable or necessary at all times, when any festival season or opportunity for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> intervenes and permits an indulgence in food, saying: <q>Can the children of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them; and then shall they fast;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352192"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;9:14-15</a></span> words which although they were spoken before the resurrection of His Body, yet specially point to the season of Eastertide, in which after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> for forty days He ate with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in His daily Presence did not allow them to fast.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p><strong>A question why we break the fast all through Eastertide.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: Why then do we relax the rigour of our abstinence in our meals all through the fifty days, whereas Christ only remained with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> for forty days after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p><strong>The answer.</strong></p>

<p>Your pertinent question deserves to be told the perfect <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason. After the Ascension of our Saviour which took place on the fortieth day after His Resurrection, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> returned from the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a>, on which He had suffered them to see Him when He was returning to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as the book of the Acts of the Apostles also testifies, and entered Jerusalem and are said to have waited ten days for the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and when these were fulfilled on the fiftieth day they received Him with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And thus in this way the number of this festival was clearly made up, which as we read was figuratively foreshadowed also in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, where when seven weeks were fulfilled the bread of the firstfruits was ordered to be offered by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to the Lord: <span class="stiki" id="note352193"><a href="../bible/deu016.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy&nbsp;16:9</a></span> and this was indeed shown to be offered to the Lord by the preaching of the Apostles which they are said on that day to have addressed to the people; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bread of the firstfruits, which when produced from the instruction of a new doctrine, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the firstfruits of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people to the Lord, five thousand men being filled with the gifts of the food. And therefore these ten days are to be kept with equal <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> as the previous forty. And the tradition about this festival, transmitted to us by Apostolic men, should be kept with the same uniformity. For therefore on those days they do not bow their knees in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, because the bending of the knees is a sign of penitence and mourning. Wherefore also during these days we observe in all things the same solemnities as on Sunday, on which day our predecessors taught that men ought not to fast nor to bow the knee, out of reverence for the Lord's Resurrection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p><strong>A question whether the relaxation of the fast is not prejudicial to the chastity of the body.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: Can the flesh, attracted by the unwonted luxuries of so long a festival fail to produce something thorny from the incentives to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> although they have been cut down? Or can the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> weighed down by the consumption of unaccustomed feasts fail to mitigate the rigour of its rule over its servant the body, especially when in our case our mature age can excite our subject members to a speedy revolt, if we venture to take our usual food in larger quantities, or unaccustomed food more freely than usual?</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p><strong>The answer on the way to keep control over abstinence.</strong></p>

<p>Theonas: If we weigh everything that we do, by a reasonable judgment of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and on the purity of our heart always consult not the opinions of other people but our own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, that interval for refreshment is sure not to interfere with our proper strictness, if only, as was said, our pure mind impartially considers the right limits of indulgence and abstinence, and fairly checks excess in either, and with real discrimination discerns whether the weight of the delicacies is a burden upon our spirits, or whether too much austerity in abstaining weighs down the other side, i.e., that of the body, and either depresses or raises that side which it sees to be raised or weighed down. For our Lord would have nothing done to His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> without being tempered by judgment, for <q>the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a king loves judgment,</q>  and therefore Solomon, the wisest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, urges us not to let our judgment incline to either side, saying: <q>Honour God with your righteous labours and offer to Him of the fruits of your righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352195"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse9">Proverbs&nbsp;3:9</a></span> For we have residing in our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> an uncorrupt and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judge who sometimes, when all are wrong, is the only person not deceived as to the state of our purity. And so with all care and pains we should preserve a constant purpose in our circumspect heart for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest if the judgment of our discretion goes wrong, we may be fired with the desire for an ill-considered abstinence, or allured by the wish for an excessive relaxation, and so weigh the substance of our strength in the tongue of an unfair balance; but we should place in one of the scales our purity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and in the other our bodily strength, and weigh them both in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, so that we may not perversely incline the scale of fairness to either side, either to undue strictness or to excessive relaxation, from the preponderating desire for one or the other, and so have this said to us by reason of excessive strictness or relaxation: <q>If you offer rightly, but dost not divide rightly, have you not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>?</q>  For those offerings of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, which we thoughtlessly extort by violently tearing our bowels, and fancy that we rightly offer to the Lord, these He execrates who <q>loves mercy and judgment</q> saying: <q>I the Lord <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> judgment, but I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> in a burnt offering.</q>  Those also who take the main part of their offerings, i.e., their offices and actions, to benefit the flesh for their own use, but leave the remains of them and a tiny portion for the Lord, these the Divine Word thus condemns as fraudulent workmen: <q>Cursed is he that does the work of the Lord fraudulently.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352198"><a href="../bible/jer048.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;48:10</a></span> It is not then without reason that the Lord reproves him who thus deceives himself by unfair considerations, saying: <q>But vain are the children of men: the children of men are liars upon the balances that they may deceive.</q>  And therefore the blessed Apostle warns us to keep hold of the reins of discretion and not to be attracted by excess and swerve to either side, saying: <q>Your reasonable service.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352200"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;12:1</a></span> And the giver of the law similarly forbids the same thing, saying: <q>Let the balance be just and the weights equal, the bushel just and the sextarius equal,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352201"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse36">Leviticus&nbsp;19:36</a></span> and Solomon also gives a like opinion on this matter: <q>Great and small weights and double measures are both unclean before the Lord, and one who uses them shall be hindered in his contrivances.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352202"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse10">Proverbs&nbsp;20:10-11</a></span> Further not only in the way in which we have said, but also in this must we strive not to have unfair weights in our hearts, nor double measures in the storehouse of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, i.e., not to overwhelm those, to whom we are to preach the word of the Lord, with precepts that are too strict and heavier than we ourselves can bear, while we take for granted that for ourselves those things which have to do with the rule of strictness are to be softened by a freer allowance of relaxation. For when we do this, what is it but to weigh and measure the goods and fruits of the Lord's commands in a double weight and measure? For if we dispense them in one way to ourselves and in another to our brethren, we are rightly blamed by the Lord because we have unfair balances and double measures, in accordance with the saying of Solomon which tells us that <q>A double weight is an abomination to the Lord, and a deceitful balance is not good in His sight.</q>  In this way also we plainly incur the guilt of using a deceitful weight and a double measure, if out of the desire for the praise of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, we make a show before the brethren of greater strictness than what we practice in private in our own cells, trying to appear more abstinent and holier in the sight of men than in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which we should not only avoid but actually loathe. But meanwhile as we have wandered some way from the question before us, let us return to the point from which we started.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p><strong>Of the time and measure of refreshment.</strong></p>

<p>So then we should keep the observance of the days mentioned in such a way that the relaxation allowed may be useful rather than harmful to the good of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of any festival cannot blunt the pricks of the flesh, nor can that fierce enemy of ours be pacified by regard for days. In order then that the observance of the customs appointed for festival seasons may be kept and that the most salutary rule of abstinence be not at all exceeded it is enough for us to allow the permitted relaxation to go so far, as for us out of regard for the festival season to take the food, which ought to be taken at the ninth hour, a little earlier; viz., at the sixth hour, but with this condition, that the regular allowance and character of the food be not altered, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the purity of body and uprightness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which has been gained by the abstinence of Lent be lost by the relaxation of Eastertide, and it profit us nothing to have acquired by our fast what a careless satiety causes us presently to lose, especially as the well-known cunning of our enemy assaults the stronghold of our purity then chiefly when he sees that our guard over it is somewhat relaxed at the celebration of some festival. Wherefore we must most vigilantly look out that the vigour of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be never enervated by seductive flatteries, and we lose not the purity of our <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, gained, as was said, by the continuous efforts of Lent, by the repose and carelessness of Eastertide. And therefore no addition at all should be made to the quality or the quantity of the food, but even on the highest festivals we should similarly abstain from those foods, by abstinence from which we preserve our uprightness on common days, that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the festival may not excite in us a most deadly conflict of carnal desires, and so be turned to grief, and put an end to that most excellent festival of the heart, which exults in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of purity; and after a brief show of carnal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> we begin to mourn our lost purity of heart with a lasting sorrow of repentance. Moreover we should strive that this warning of the prophetic exhortation may not be uttered against us to no purpose: <q>Celebrate, O Judah, your festivals, and pay your vows.</q>  For if the occurrence of festival days does not interfere with the continuity of our abstinence, we shall continually enjoy spiritual festivals and so, when we cease from servile work, <q>there shall be month after month and <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> after <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352205"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse23">Isaiah&nbsp;66:23</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p><strong>A question on the different ways of keeping Lent.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: What is the reason why Lent is kept for six weeks, while in some countries a possibly more earnest care for religion seems to have added a seventh week as well, though neither number when you subtract Sunday and Saturday, gives the total of forty days? For only six and thirty days are included in these weeks. </p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p><strong>The answer to the effect that the fast of Lent has reference to the tithe of the year.</strong></p>

<p>Theonas: Although the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> simplicity of some folks would put aside a question on this subject, yet because you are more scrupulous in your examination of those things which another would consider unworthy to be asked about, and want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the whole <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this observance of ours and the secret of it, you shall have a very clear reason for this also, that you may still more plainly be convinced that our predecessors taught nothing unreasonable. By the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> the command propounded to all the people generally was this: <q>You shall offer to the Lord your God your <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and firstfruits.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352207"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse29">Exodus&nbsp;22:29</a></span> And so, while we are commanded to offer <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of our substance and all our fruits, it is much more needful for us to offer <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of our life and ordinary employments and actions, which certainly is clearly arranged for in the calculation of Lent. For the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of the number of all the days included in the revolving circle of the year is thirty-six days and a half. But in seven weeks, if Sundays and Saturdays are subtracted, there remain thirty-five days assigned for <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. But by the addition of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Eve when the Saturday's fast is prolonged to the cock-crowing at the dawn of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Day, not only is the number of thirty-six days made up, but in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of the five days which seemed to be over, if the bit of the night which was added be taken into account nothing will be wanting to the whole sum.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p><strong>How we ought also to offer our firstfruits to the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>But what shall I say of the firstfruits which surely are given daily by all who serve Christ faithfully? For when men waking from sleep and arising with renewed activity after their rest, before they take in any impulse or thought in their heart, or admit any recollection or consideration of business consecrate their first and earliest thoughts as divine offerings, what are they doing indeed but rendering the firstfruits of their produce through the High Priest <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> for the enjoyment of this life and a figure of the daily resurrection? And also when roused from sleep in the same way they offer to God a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and invoke Him with the first motion of their tongue and celebrate His name and praise, and throwing open, the first thing, the door of their lips to sing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to Him they offer to God the offices of their mouth; and to Him also in the same way their bring the earliest offerings of their hands and steps, when they rise from bed and stand in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and before they use the services of their limbs for their own purposes, take to themselves nothing of their services, but for His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> advance their steps, and set them in His praise and so render the first fruits of all their movements by stretching forth the hands, bending the knees, and prostrating the whole body. For in no other way can we fulfil that of which we sing in the Psalm: <q>I prevented the dawning of the day and cried;</q> and: <q>My eyes to You have prevented the morning that I might meditate on Your words;</q> and: <q>In the morning shall my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> prevent You;</q>  unless after our rest in sleep when, as we said above, we are restored as from darkness and death to this light, we have the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> not to begin by taking any of all the services both of mind and body for our own uses. For there is no other morning which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <q>prevented,</q> or which in the same way we ought to prevent, except either ourselves, i.e., our occupations and feelings and earthly cares, without which we cannot exist&mdash; or the most subtle suggestions of the adversary, which he tries to suggest to us, while still resting and overcome with sleep, by the phantoms of vain dreams, with which, when we presently awake, he will fill our minds and occupy us, that he may be the first to seize and carry off the spoils of our firstfruits. Wherefore we must take the utmost care (if we want to fulfil in act the meaning of the above quoted verse) that an anxious watchfulness takes regard of our first and earliest morning thoughts, that they may not be defiled beforehand being hastily taken possession of by our jealous adversary, and thus he may make our firstfruits to be rejected by the Lord as worthless and common. And if he is not prevented by us with watchful circumspection of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he will not lay aside his habit of miserably anticipating us nor cease day after day to prevent us by his wiles. And therefore if we want to offer firstfruits that are acceptable and well pleasing to God of the fruits of our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, we ought to spend no ordinary care to keep all the senses of our body, especially during the hours of the morning, as a sacred holocaust to the Lord pure and undefiled in all things. And this kind of devotion many even of those who live in the world observe with the utmost care, as they rise before it is light or very early, and do not at all mix in the ordinary and necessary business of this world before hastening to church and striving to consecrate in the sight of God the firstfruits of all their actions and doings.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

<p><strong>Why Lent is kept by very many with a different number of days.</strong></p>

<p>Further, as for what you say; viz., that in some countries Lent is kept in different ways, i.e., for six or seven weeks, it is but one system and the same manner of the fast that is preserved by the different observance of the weeks. For those who think one ought to fast also on the Saturday, have determined on the observance of six weeks. They therefore fast for six days out of the seven, and this being six times repeated makes up the six and thirty days. It is therefore, as we said, but one system and the same manner of the fast, although there seems to be a difference in the number of the weeks.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<p><strong>Why it is called Quadragesima, when the fast is only kept for thirty-six days.</strong></p>

<p>But further, as man's carelessness dropped out of sight the reason of this, this season when, as was said, the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of the year are offered by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> for thirty-six days and a half, was called Quadragesima,  a name which perhaps they thought ought to be given to it for this reason; viz., that it is said that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself fasted for forty days. To the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of which number are not unsuitably applied those forty years in which <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> dwelt in the wilderness, and in like manner the forty stations which they are said to have passed through with a mystic meaning. Or perhaps the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> was properly given the name of Quadragesima from the use of the custom-house. For so that state tax is commonly called, from which the same proportion of the increment is assigned for the king's use, as the legal tribute of Quadragesima, which is required of us by the King of all the ages for the use of our life. At any rate, although this has nothing to do with the question raised, yet I think that I ought not to omit the fact that very often our elders used to testify that especially on these days the whole body of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was attacked according to the ancient custom of the people opposed to them, and was more vehemently urged to forsake their homes, for this reason, because in accordance with this figure, whereby the Egyptians formerly oppressed the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with grievous afflictions, so now also the spiritual Egyptians try to bow down the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, i.e., the monastic folk, with hard and vile tasks, lest by means of that peace which is dear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we should forsake the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and for our good cross to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, so that <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> rages against us and says: <q>They are idle and therefore they cry saying: Let us go and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the Lord our God. Let them be oppressed with labours, and be harassed in their works, and they shall not be harassed by vain words.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352210"><a href="../bible/exo005.htm#verse8">Exodus&nbsp;5:8-9</a></span> For certainly their folly imagines that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the Lord, which is only offered in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of a pure heart, is the height of folly, for <q>religion is an abomination to a sinner.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352211"><a href="../bible/sir050.htm#verse24">Sirach&nbsp;50:24</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>

<p><strong>How those who are perfect go beyond the fixed rule of Lent.</strong></p>

<p>By this law of Lent then the man who is upright and perfect is not restrained nor is he content with merely submitting to that paltry rule which the heads of the church have established for those who all the year round are involved in pleasure or business, that they may be bound by this legal requirement and forced at any rate during these days to find time for the Lord, and dedicate to Him the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of the days of their life, all of which they would have consumed as their profits. But the righteous, for whom the law is not appointed, and who devote to spiritual duties not a small part; viz., the tenth, but the whole time of their life, because they are free from the burden of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> according to law, for this reason, if any worthy and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> occasion happening to them constrains them, are ready to relax their station fast  without any hesitation. For in their case it is no paltry <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> that is diminished, as they offer all that they have to the Lord equally with themselves. And this certainly a man could not do without being guilty of a grievous wrong, who, offering nothing of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is forced to pay his <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> by the stern compulsion of the law which takes no excuse. Wherefore it is clearly established that the servant of the law cannot be perfect, who only shuns those things which are forbidden and does those things which are commanded, but that those are really perfect who do not take advantage even of those things which the law allows. And in this way, though it is said of the Mosaic law that <q>the law brought nothing to perfection,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352213"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse19">Hebrews&nbsp;7:19</a></span> we read that some of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were perfect because they went beyond the commands of the law and lived under the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> that the law is not appointed for the righteous but for the unrighteous and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and defiled, etc.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352214"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:9-10</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>

<p><strong>Of the origin and beginning of Lent.</strong></p>

<p>Howbeit you should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that as long as the primitive church retained its perfection unbroken, this observance of Lent did not exist. For they were not bound by the requirements of this order, or by any legal enactments, nor confined in the very narrow limits of the fast, as the fast embraced equally the whole year round. But when the multitude of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> began day by day to decline from that apostolic fervour, and to look after their own <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and not to portion it out for the good of all the faithful in accordance with the arrangement of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but having an eye to their own private expenses, tried not only to keep it but actually to increase it, not content with following the example of Ananias and Sapphira, then it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that men who were hampered by worldly cares, and almost <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, if I may say so, of abstinence and contrition, should be recalled to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> duty by a fast canonically enjoined, and be constrained by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of paying the legal <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, as this certainly would be good for the weak brethren and could not do any harm to the perfect who were living under the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the gospel and by their <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> devotion going beyond the law, so as to succeed in attaining to the blessedness which the Apostle speaks of: <q>For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the law but under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352215"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;6:14</a></span> For of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot exercise dominion over one who lives faithfully under the liberty of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>

<p><strong>A question, how we ought to understand the Apostle's words: <q>Sin shall not have dominion over you.</q></strong></p>

<p>Germanus: Because this saying of the Apostle, which promises freedom from care not only to <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> but to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in general, cannot lead us wrong, it seems to us somewhat obscure. For whereas he maintains that all those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the gospel are at liberty and free from the yoke and dominion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, how is it that the dominion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> holds vigorous sway over almost all the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, in accordance with the Lord's words, where He says: <q>Every one that does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note352216"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;8:34</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>

<p><strong>The answer on the difference between grace and the commands of the law.</strong></p>

<p>Theonas: Your inquiry once more raises before us a question of no small extent. The explanation of which though I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it cannot be taught to or understood by the inexperienced, yet as far as I can, I will try to set forth in words and briefly to explain, if only your minds will follow up and act upon what we say. For whatever is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not by teaching but by experience, just as it cannot be taught by one without experience, so neither can it be grasped or taken in by the mind of one who has not laid the foundation by a similar study and training. And therefore I think it necessary for us first to inquire somewhat carefully what is the purpose or meaning of the law, and what is the system and perfection of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that from this we may succeed in understanding the dominion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and how to drive it out. And so the law chiefly commands men to seek the bonds of wedlock, saying: <q>Blessed is he that has seed in Sion and an household in Jerusalem;</q>  and: <q>Cursed is the barren that has not borne.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352218"><a href="../bible/job024.htm#verse21">Job&nbsp;24:21</a></span> On the other hand <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> invites us to the purity of perpetual <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and the undefiled state of blessed <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, saying: <q>Blessed are the barren, and the breasts which have not given suck;</q> and: <q>he that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> not father and mother and wife cannot be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>;</q> and this of the Apostle: <q>It remains that they that have wives be as though they had them not.</q>  The law says: <q>You shall not delay to offer your <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and firstfruits;</q> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> says: <q>If you will be perfect, go and sell all that you have and give to the poor:</q>  The law forbids not retaliation for wrongs and vengeance for injuries, saying <q>An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</q> Grace would have our patience <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the injuries and blows offered to us being redoubled, and bids us be ready to endure twice as much damage; saying: <q>If a man strike you on one cheek, offer him the other also; and to him who will contend with you at the law and take away your coat, give him your cloak also.</q>  The one decrees that we should <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> our enemies, the other that we should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them so that it holds that even for them we ought always to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33</h2>

<p><strong>Of the fact that the precepts of the gospel are milder than those of the law.</strong></p>

<p>Whoever therefore climbs this height of evangelical perfection, is at once raised by the merits of such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> above every law, and disregarding as trivial all that is commanded by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, recognizes that he is only subject to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, by whose aid he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he attained to that most exalted condition. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has no dominion over him, <q>because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is given to us,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352222"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> shuts out all care for everything else, and can neither desire what is forbidden, or disregard what is commanded, as its whole aim and all its desire is ever fixed on divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and to such an extent is it not caught by the delights of worthless things, that it actually does not take advantage of those things which are permitted. But under the law, where lawful marriages are observed, although the rovings of wantonness are restrained, and bound down to one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> alone, yet the pricks of carnal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> cannot help being vigorous; and it is hard for the fire, for which fuel is expressly supplied, to be thus shut in within prearranged limits, so as not to spread further and burn up anything it touches. As even if this objection occurs to it that it is not allowed to be kindled beyond these limits, yet even while it is kept in check, it is on fire because the will itself is in fault, and its habit of carnal intercourse hurries it into too speedy excesses of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. But those whom the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Saviour has fired with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, so consume all the thorns of carnal desires in the fire of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that no dying embers of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> interfere with the coldness of their purity. The servants of the law then from the use of lawful things fall away to unlawful; the partakers of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> while they disregard lawful things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of unlawful ones. But as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is alive in one who loves marriage, so is it also in one who is satisfied with merely paying his <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and firstfruits. For, while he is dawdling or careless, he is sure to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in regard to either their quality or quantity, or the daily distribution of them. For as he is commanded unweariedly to minister to those in want of what is his, although he may dispense it with the fullest <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion, yet it is hard for him not to fall often into the snares of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But over those who have not set at naught the counsel of the Lord, but who, disposing of all their property to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, take up their cross and follow the bestower of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can have no dominion. For no faithless anxiety for getting food will annoy him who piously distributes and disperses his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> already <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Christ and no longer regarded as his own; nor will any grudging hesitation take away from the cheerfulness of his almsgiving, because without any thought of his own needs or <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of his own food running short he is distributing what has once for all been completely offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is no longer regarded as his own, as he is sure that when he has succeeded in stripping himself as he desires, he will be fed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> much more than the birds of the air. On the other hand he who retains his goods of this world, or, bound by the rules of the old law, distributes the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of his produce, and his firstfruits, or a portion of his income, although he may to a considerable degree quench the fire of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by this dew of almsgiving, yet, however generously he gives away his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, it is impossible for him altogether to rid himself of the dominion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless perhaps by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, together with his substance he gets rid of all <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of possessing. In the same way he cannot fail to be subject to the bloody sway of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whoever chooses to pull out, as the law commands, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, or to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> his enemy, for while he desires by retaliation in exchange to avenge an injury done to himself, and while he cherishes bitter <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against an enemy, he is sure always to be inflamed with the passion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and rage. But whoever lives under the light of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the gospel, and overcomes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by not resisting it, but by bearing it, and does not hesitate of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> to give to one who smites his right cheek, the other also, and to one who wants to raise a lawsuit against him for his coat, gives his cloak also, and who loves his enemies, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for those who <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> him, this man has broken the yoke of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and burst its chains. For he is not living under the law, which does not destroy the seeds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (whence not without reason the Apostle says of it: <q>There is a setting aside of the former commandment because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof: for the law brought nothing to perfection;</q> and the Lord says by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>And I gave them commands that were not good, and ordinances, whereby they could not live</q> , but under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which does not merely lop off the boughs of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but actually tears up the very roots of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>

<p><strong>How a man can be shown to be under grace.</strong></p>

<p>Whoever then strives to reach the perfection of evangelical teaching, this man living under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not oppressed by the dominion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for to be under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is to do those things which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> commands. But whoever will not submit himself to the complete requirements of evangelical perfection, must not remain <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that, although he seems to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and to be a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, yet he is not under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but is still shackled by the chains of the law, and weighed down by the burden of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is the aim of Him, who by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of adoption accepts all those by whom He has been received, not to destroy but to build upon, not to abolish but to fulfil the Mosaic requirements. But some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing about this, and disregarding the splendid counsels and exhortations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are so emancipated by the carelessness of a freedom too hastily assumed, that they not only fail to carry out the commands of Christ as if they were too hard, but actually scorn as antiquated, the commands given to them as beginners and children by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, saying in this dangerous freedom of theirs that which the Apostle execrates: <q>We have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, because we are not under the law but under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352224"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;6:15</a></span> He then who is neither under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, because he has never climbed the heights of the Lord's teaching, nor under the law, because he has not accepted even those small commands of the law, this man, ground down beneath a twofold rule of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, fancies that he has received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, simply and solely for this, that by this dangerous liberty of his he may make himself none of His, and falls into that state, which the Apostle Peter warns us to avoid, saying: <q>Act as free, and not having your liberty as a cloak of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q> The blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> also says: <q>For you, brethren, were called to liberty,</q> i.e., that you might be free from the dominion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <q>only use not your liberty for an occasion of the flesh,</q>  i.e., <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the doing away with the commands of the law is a licence to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this liberty, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> teaches us is nowhere but where the Lord is dwelling, for he says: <q>The Lord is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is there is liberty.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352226"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> Wherefore I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether I could express and explain the meaning of the blessed Apostle, as those <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how, who have experience; one thing I do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that it is very clearly revealed even without anyone's explanation to all those who have perfectly acquired <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F74;</span>, i.e., practical training. For they will need no effort to understand in discussion what they have already learned by practice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35</h2>

<p><strong>A question, why sometimes when we are fasting more strictly than usual, we are troubled by carnal desires more keenly than usual.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: You have very clearly explained a most difficult question, and one which, as we think, is unknown to many. Wherefore we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you to add this also for our good, and carefully to expound why sometimes when we are <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> more strictly than usual, and are exhausted and worn out, severer bodily struggles are excited. For often on waking from sleep, when we have discovered that we have been defiled  we are so dejected in heart that we do not even venture faithfully to rise even for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36</h2>

<p><strong>The answer, telling that this question should be reserved for a future Conference.</strong></p>

<p>Theonas: Your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> indeed, whereby you desire to reach the way of perfection, not for a moment only but fully and perfectly, urges us to continue this discussion unweariedly. For you are anxiously inquiring not about external <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> or outward <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, but about that which is secret, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that complete perfection does not consist in this visible continence of the flesh which can be attained either by constraint, or by hypocrisy even by unbelievers, but in that <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and invisible purity of heart, which the blessed Apostle describes as follows: <q>For he is not a Jew which is so outwardly, nor is that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> which is outward in the flesh, but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter, whose praise is not of men but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352228"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;2:28-29</a></span> who alone searches the secrets of the heart. But because it is not possible for your wish to be fully satisfied (as the short space of the night that is left is not enough for the investigation of this most difficult question,) I think it well to postpone it for a while. For these matters, as they should be propounded by us quietly and with an heart entirely free from all bustling thoughts, so should they be received into your minds; for just as the inquiry ought to be undertaken for the sake of our common purity, so they cannot be learned or acquired by one who is without the gift of uprightness. For we do not ask what arguments of empty words, but what the inward <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and the greater force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can persuade. And therefore with regard to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and teaching of this purification nothing can be brought forward except by one who has had experience of it, nor can anything be committed except to one who is a most eager and very earnest lover of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, who does not hope to attain it by asking questions with mere vain words, but by striving with all his might and main, with no wish for useless chattering but with the desire to purify himself internally.</p>
