<h1>Conference 23</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>THE THIRD CONFERENCE OF ABBOT THEONAS. ON SINLESSNESS.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>Discourse of Abbot Theonas on the Apostle's words: <q>For I do not the good which I would.</q></strong></p>

<p>At the return of light therefore, as the old man was forced by our intense urgency to investigate the depths of the Apostle's subject, he spoke as follows: As for the passages by which you try to prove that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> spoke not in his own person but in that of sinners: <q>For I do not the good that I would, but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, that I do;</q> or this: <q>But if I do that which I would not, it is no longer I that do it but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that dwells in me;</q> or what follows: <q>For I delight in the law of God after the inner man, but I see another law in my members opposing the law of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and bringing me into captivity to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is in my members;</q>  these passages on the contrary plainly show that they cannot possibly fit the person of sinners, but that what is said can only apply to those that are perfect, and that it only suits the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of those who follow the good example of the Apostles. Else how could these words apply to the person of sinners: <q>For I do not the good which I would, but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> that I do</q>? Or even this: <q>But if I do what I would not it is no longer I that do it but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that dwells in me</q>? For what sinner defiles himself unwillingly by adulteries and fornication? Who against his will prepares plots against his neighbour? Who is driven by unavoidable necessity to oppress a man by false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> or cheat him by theft, or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> the goods of another or shed his blood? Nay rather, as <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>Mankind is diligently inclined to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> from his youth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352230"><a href="../bible/gen008.htm#verse21">Genesis&nbsp;8:21</a></span> For to such an extent are all inflamed by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and desire to carry out what they like, that they actually look out with watchful care for an opportunity of committing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and are afraid of being too slow to enjoy their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in their shame and the mass of their crimes, as the Apostle says in censure, <span class="stiki" id="note352231"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse19">Philippians&nbsp;3:19</a></span> and seek credit for themselves out of their own confusion, of whom also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah maintains that they commit their flagitious crimes not only not unwillingly nor with ease of heart and body, but with laborious efforts to such an extent that they come to toil to carry them out, so that they are prevented even by the hindrance of arduous difficulty from their deadly quest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; as he says: <q>They have laboured to do wickedly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352232"><a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;9:5</a></span> Who also will say that this applies to sinners: <q>And so with the mind I myself serve the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but with the flesh the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> as it is plain that they serve God neither with the mind nor the flesh? Or how can those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with the body serve God with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, when the flesh receives the incitement to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from the heart, and the Creator of either nature Himself declares that the fount and spring of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> flows from the latter, saying: <q>From the heart proceed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, etc.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352233"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;15:19</a></span> Wherefore it is clearly shown that this cannot in any way be taken of the person of sinners, who not only do not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, but actually <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and are so far from serving God with either the mind or the flesh that they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with the mind before they do with the flesh, and before they carry out the pleasures of the body are overcome by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in their mind and thoughts.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>How the Apostle completed many good actions.</strong></p>

<p>It remains therefore for us to measure its meaning and drift from the inmost feelings of the speaker, and to discuss what the blessed Apostle called good, and what he pronounced by comparison <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not by the bare meaning of the words, but with the same insight which he showed, and to investigate his meaning with due regard to the worth and goodness of the speaker. For then we shall be able to understand the words, which were uttered by God's inspiration, in accordance with his purpose and wish, when we weigh the position and character of those by whom they were spoken, and are ourselves clothed with the same feelings (not in words but by experience), in accordance with the character of which most certainly all the thoughts are conceived and opinions uttered. Wherefore let us carefully consider what was in the main that good which the Apostle could not do when he would. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there are many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which we cannot deny that the blessed Apostle and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as good as he either have by nature, or acquire by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, continence is praiseworthy, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is to be admired, kindness is liberal, sobriety is careful, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is modest, pity is kind, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>: all of which we cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> fully and in perfection in the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> and his companions, so that they taught religion by the lesson of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> rather than their words. What if they were always consumed with the constant care of all the churches and watchful anxiety? How great a good is this pity, what perfection it is to burn for them that are offended, to be weak with the weak! <span class="stiki" id="note352234"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> If then the Apostle abounded with such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, we cannot recognize what that good was, in the perfection of which the Apostle was lacking, unless we have advanced to that state of mind in which he was speaking. And so all those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which we say that he possessed, though they are like most splendid and precious gems, yet when they are compared with that most beautiful and unique pearl which the merchant in the gospel sought and wanted to acquire by selling all that he possessed, so does their value seem poor and trifling, so that if they are without hesitation got rid of, the possession of one good thing alone will enrich the man who sells countless <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>What is really the good which the Apostle testifies that he could not perform.</strong></p>

<p>What then is that one thing which is so incomparably above those great and innumerable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, that, while they are all scorned and rejected, it alone should be acquired? Doubtless it is that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good part, the grand and lasting character of which is thus described by the Lord, when Mary disregarded the duties of hospitality and courtesy and chose it: <q>Martha, Martha, you are careful and troubled about many things: but there is but need of but few things or even of one only. Mary has chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her.</q>  Contemplation then, i.e., meditation on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the one thing, the value of which all the merits of our righteous acts, all our aims at <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, come short of. And all those things which we said <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, were not only good and useful, but even great and splendid. But as, for example, the metal of alloy which is considered of some use and worth, becomes worthless when silver is taken into account, and again the value of silver disappears in comparison with gold, and gold itself is disregarded when compared with precious stones, and yet a quantity of precious stones however splendid are outdone by the brightness of a single pearl, so all those merits of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, although they are not merely good and useful for the present life, but also secure the gift of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, yet if they are compared with the merit of Divine <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, will be considered trifling and so to speak, fit to be sold. And to support this illustration by the authority of Scripture, does not Scripture declare of all things in general which were created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and say: <q>And behold everything that God had made was very good;</q> and again: <q>And things that God has made are all good in their season</q>?  These things then which in the present time are termed not simply and solely good, but emphatically <q>very good</q> (for they are really convenient for us while living in this world, either for purposes of life, or for remedies for the body, or by reason of some unknown usefulness, or else they are indeed <q>very good,</q> because they enable us <q>to see the invisible things of God from the creatures of the world, being understood by the things that are made, even His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power and Godhead,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352237"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;1:20</a></span> from this great and orderly arrangement of the fabric of the world; and to contemplate them from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of everything in it), yet none of these things will keep the name of good if they are regarded in the light of that world to come, where no variation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and no loss of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> blessedness need be feared. The bliss of which world is thus described: <q>The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352238"><a href="../bible/isa030.htm#verse26">Isaiah&nbsp;30:26</a></span> These things then which are great and wondrous to be gazed on, and marvellous, will at once appear as vanity if they are compared with the future promises from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; as David says: <q>They all shall wax old as a garment, and as a vesture shall  You change them, and they shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail.</q>  Because then there is nothing of itself enduring, nothing unchangeable, nothing good but Deity alone, while every creature, to obtain the blessing of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and immutability, aims at this not by its own nature but by participation of its Creator, and His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, they cannot maintain their character for goodness when compared with their Creator.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>How man's goodness and righteousness are not good if compared with the goodness and righteousness of God.</strong></p>

<p>But if we want also to establish the force of this opinion by still clearer <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, is it not the case that while we read of many things as called good in the gospel, as a good tree, and good treasure, and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, and a good servant, for He says: <q>A good tree cannot bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit;</q> and: <q>a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things;</q> and: <q>Well done, good and faithful servant;</q>  and certainly there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that none of these are good in themselves, yet if we take into consideration the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, none of them will be called good, as the Lord says: <q>None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> save God alone</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note352241"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;18:19</a></span> In whose sight even the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves, who in the excellence of their calling in many ways went beyond the goodness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, are said to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as the Lord thus speaks to them: <q>If you then being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to them that ask Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352242"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;7:11</a></span> Finally as our goodness turns to badness in the eyes of the Highest so also our righteousness when set against the Divine righteousness is considered like a menstruous cloth, as Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says: <q>All your righteousness is like a menstruous cloth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352243"><a href="../bible/isa064.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;64:6</a></span> And to produce something still plainer, even the vital precepts of the law itself, which are said to have been <q>given by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by the hand of a mediator,</q> and of which the same Apostle says: <q>So the law indeed is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and the commandment is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just and good,</q>  when they are compared with the perfection of the gospel are pronounced anything but good by the Divine oracle: for He says: <q>And I gave them precepts that were not good, and ordinances whereby they should not live in them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352245"><a href="../bible/eze020.htm#verse25">Ezekiel&nbsp;20:25</a></span> The Apostle also affirms that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the law is so dimmed by the light of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> that he declares that in comparison with the splendour of the gospel it is not to be considered <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, saying: <q>For even that which was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> was not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by reason of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that excels.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352246"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> And Scripture keeps up this comparison on the other side also, i.e., in weighing the merits of sinners, so that in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> it justifies those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> less, saying: <q><a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> is justified above you;</q> and again: <q>For what has your sister <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>?</q> and: <q>The rebellious <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has justified her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in comparison of the treacherous Judah.</q>  So then the merits of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which I enumerated above, though in themselves they are good and precious, yet become dim in comparison of the brightness of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. For they greatly hinder and retard the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are taken up with earthly aims even at good works, from the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of that sublime good.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>How no one can be continually intent upon that highest good.</strong></p>

<p>For who, when <q>delivering the poor from the hand of them that are too strong for him, and the needy and the poor from them that strip him,</q> who when <q>breaking the jaws of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and snatching their prey from between their teeth,</q>  can with a calm mind regard the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Divine Majesty during the actual work of intervention? Who when ministering support to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, or when receiving with benevolent kindness the crowds that come to him, can at the very moment when he is with anxious mind perplexed for the wants of his brethren, contemplate the vastness of the bliss on high, and while he is shaken by the troubles and cares of the present life look forward to the state of the world to come with an heart raised above the stains of earth? Whence the blessed David when laying down that this alone is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, longs to cling constantly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and says: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to cling to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to put my hope in the Lord.</q>  And Ecclesiastes also declares that this cannot be done without fault by any of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and says: <q>For there is not a righteous man upon earth, that does good and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352250"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse21">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:21</a></span> For who, even if he be the chief of all righteous and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, can we ever think could, while bound in the chains of this life, so acquire this chief good, as never to cease from divine <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, or be thought to be drawn away by earthly thoughts even for a short time from Him Who alone is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>? Who ever takes no care for food, none for clothing or other carnal things, or when anxious about receiving the brethren, or change of place, or building his cell, has never desired the aid of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> assistance, nor when harassed by scarcity and want has incurred this sentence of reproof from the Lord: <q>Be not anxious for your life what you shall eat, nor for your body what you shall put on</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note352251"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;6:23</a></span> Further we confidently assert that even the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> himself who surpassed in the number of his sufferings the toils of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, could not possibly fulfil this, as he himself testifies to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>You yourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these hands have ministered to my needs, and to the needs of those who were with me,</q> or when in writing in the Thessalonians he testifies that he <q>worked in labour and weariness night and day.</q>  And although for this there were great rewards for his merits prepared, yet his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, however <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and sublime it might be, could not help being sometimes drawn away from that heavenly <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> by its attention to earthly labours. Further, when he saw himself enriched with such practical fruits, and on the other hand considered in his heart the good of meditation, and weighed as it were in one scale the profit of all these labours and in the other the delights of divine <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, when for a long time he had corrected the balance in his breast, while the vast rewards for his labours delighted him on one side, and on the other the desire for unity with and the inseparable companionship of Christ inclined him to depart this life, at last in his perplexity he cries out and says: <q>What I shall choose I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, for it were much better: but to abide in the flesh is more necessary for your sakes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352253"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse22">Philippians&nbsp;1:22-24</a></span> Though then in many ways he preferred this excellent good to all the fruits of his preaching, yet he submits himself in consideration of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, without which none can gain the Lord; and for their sakes, whom hitherto he had soothed with milk as nourishment from the breasts of the gospel, does not refuse to be parted from Christ, which is bad for himself though useful for others. For he is driven to choose this the rather by that excessive goodness of his whereby for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his brethren he is ready, were it possible, to incur even the last <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of an Anathema. <q>For I could wish,</q> he says, <q>that I myself were Anathema from Christ for my brethren's sake, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352254"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;9:3-4</a></span> i.e., I could wish to be subject not only to temporal, but even to perpetual punishment, if only all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, were it possible, might enjoy the fellowship of Christ: for I am sure that the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all would be better for Christ and for me than my own. That then the Apostle might perfectly gain this chief good, i.e., to enjoy the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to be joined continually to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he was ready to be parted from this body, which as it is feeble and hindered by the many requirements of its frailties cannot help separating from union with Christ: for it is impossible for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that is harassed by such frequent cares, and hampered by such various and tiresome troubles, always to enjoy the Divine vision. For what aim of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> can be so persistent, what purpose can be so high that that crafty plotter does not sometimes destroy it? Who has frequented the recesses of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> and shunned intercourse with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in such a way that he never trips by unnecessary thoughts, and by looking on things or being occupied in earthly actions falls away from that <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>? Who ever could preserve such fervour of spirit as not sometimes to pass by roving thoughts from his attention to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and fall away suddenly from heavenly to earthly things? Which of us (to pass over other times of wandering) even at the very moment when he raises his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to God on high, does not fall into a sort of stupor, and even against his will offend by that very thing from which he hoped for pardon of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Who, I ask, is so alert and vigilant as never, while he is singing a Psalm to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to allow his mind to wander from the meaning of Scripture? Who is so intimate with and closely joined to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to congratulate himself on having carried out for a single day that rule of the Apostle's, whereby he bids us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> without ceasing? <span class="stiki" id="note352255"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> And though all these things may seem to some, who are involved in grosser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to be trivial and altogether foreign to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the value of perfection a quantity even of very small matters becomes most serious.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>How those who think that they are without sin are like purblind people.</strong></p>

<p>As if we were to suppose that two men, one of whom was clear sighted with perfect vision, and the other, one whose eyesight was obscured by dimness of vision, had together entered some great house that was filled with a quantity of bundles, instruments, and vessels, would not he, whose dullness of vision prevented his seeing everything, assert that there was nothing there but chests, beds, benches, tables, and whatever met the fingers of one who felt them rather than the eyes of one who saw them, while on the other hand would not the other, who searched out what was hidden with clear and bright eyes, declare that there were there many most minute articles, and what could scarcely be counted; which if they were ever gathered up into a single pile, would by their number equal or perhaps exceed the size of those few things which the other had felt. So then even <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and, if we may so say, men who <em>see</em>, whose aim is the utmost perfection, cleverly detect in themselves even those things which the gaze of our mind being as it were darkened cannot see, and condemn them very severely, to such an extent that those who have not, as it seems to our carelessness, dimmed the whiteness of their body, which is as it were like snow, with even the slightest spot of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, seem to themselves to be covered with many stains, if, I will not say any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or vain thoughts creep into the doors of their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but even the recollection of a Psalm which has to be said takes off the attention of the kneeler at the time for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For if, say they, when we ask some great man, I will not say for our life and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but for some advantage and profit, we fasten all our attention of mind and body upon him, and hang with trembling expectation on his nod, with no slight dread lest haply some foolish or unsuitable word may turn aside the pity of our hearer, and then too, when we are standing in the forum or in the courts of earthly judges, with our opponent standing over against us, if in the midst of the prosecution and trial any coughing, or spitting, or laughing, or yawning, or sleep overtakes us, with what <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> will our ever watchful opponent stir up the severity of the judge to our damage: how much more, when we entreat Him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all secrets, should we, by reason of our imminent danger of everlasting death, plead with earnest and anxious <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the kindness of the judge, especially as on the other side there stands one who is both our crafty seducer and our accuser! And not without reason will he be bound by no light <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but by a grievous fault of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, who, when he pours forth his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, departs at once from His sight as if from the eyes of one who neither sees nor hears, and follows the vanity of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thoughts. But they who cover the eyes of their heart with a thick veil of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and as the Saviour says, <q>Seeing see not and hearing hear not nor understand,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352256"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;13:13</a></span> hardly regard in the inmost recesses of their breast even those faults which are great and deadly, and cannot with clear eyes look at any deceitful thoughts, nor even those vague and secret desires which strike the mind with slight and subtle suggestions, nor the captivities of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but always wandering among impure thoughts they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to be sorry when they are distracted from that meditation which is so special, nor can they grieve that they have lost anything as while they lay open their mind to the entrance of any thought as they please, they have nothing set before them to hold to as the main thing or to desire in every way.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>How those who maintain that a man can be without sin are charged with a twofold error.</strong></p>

<p>The reason however which drives us into this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is that, as we are utterly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of being without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,  we fancy that we cannot contract any guilt from those idle and random vagaries of our thoughts, but being rendered stupid by dullness and as it were smitten with blindness we can see nothing in ourselves but capital offenses, and think that we have only to keep clear of those things which are condemned also by the severity of secular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and if we find that even for a short time we are free from these we at once <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all in us. Accordingly we are distinguished from the number of those who see, because we do not see the many small stains, which are crowded together in us, and are not smitten with saving contrition, if the malady of vexation overtakes our thoughts, nor are we sorry that we are struck by the suggestions of vainglory, nor do we weep over our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> offered up so tardily and coldly, nor consider it a fault if while we are singing or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, something else besides the actual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or Psalm fills our thoughts, nor are we horrified because we do not blush to conceive many things which we are ashamed to speak or do before men, in our heart, which, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, lies open to the Divine gaze; nor do we purge away the pollution of filthy dreams with copious ablutions of our tears, nor grieve that in the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> act of almsgiving when we are assisting the needs of the brethren, or ministering support to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the brightness of our cheerfulness is clouded over by a stingy delay, nor do we think that we are affected by any loss when we forget God and think about things that are temporal and corrupt, so that these words of Solomon fairly apply to us: <q>They smite me but I have not grieved, and they have mocked me, but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352258"><a href="../bible/pro023.htm#verse35">Proverbs&nbsp;23:35</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>How it is given to but few to understand what sin is.</strong></p>

<p>Those on the other hand who make the sum of all their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and delight and bliss consist in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of divine and spiritual things alone, if they are unwillingly withdrawn from them even for a short time by thoughts that force themselves upon them, punish this as if it were a kind of sacrilege in them, and avenge it by immediate chastisement, and in their grief that they have preferred some worthless creature (to which their mental gaze was turned aside) to their Creator, charge themselves with the guilt (I had almost said) of impiety, and although they turn the eyes of their heart with the utmost speed to behold the brightness of the Divine Glory, yet they cannot tolerate even for a very short time the darkness of carnal thoughts, and execrate whatever keeps back their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> gaze from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light. Finally when the blessed Apostle John would instill this feeling into everybody he says: <q>Little children, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not the world, neither the things which are in the world. If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is not in him: for everything that is in the world is the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life, which is not of the Father but of the world. And the world perishes and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> thereof: but he that does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abides forever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352259"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:15-17</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> therefore scorn all those things on which the world exists, but it is impossible for them never to be carried away to them by a brief aberration of thoughts, and even now no man, except our Lord and Saviour, can keep his naturally wandering mind always fixed on the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of God so as never to be carried away from it through the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of something in this world; as <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says: <q>Even the stars are not clean in His sight,</q> and again: <q>If He puts no trust in His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and finds iniquity in His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> or as the more correct translation has it: <q>Behold among His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> none is unchangeable, and the heavens are not pure in His sight.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>Of the care with which a monk should preserve the recollection of God.</strong></p>

<p>I should say then that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who keep a firm hold of the recollection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and are borne along, as it were, with their steps suspended on a line stretched out on high, may be rightly compared to rope dancers, commonly called funambuli, who risk all their safety and life on the path of that very narrow rope, with no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they will immediately meet with a most dreadful death if their foot swerves or trips in the very slightest degree, or goes over the line of the course in which alone is safety. And while with marvellous skill they ply their airy steps through space, if they keep not their steps to that all too narrow path with careful and anxious regulation, the earth which is the natural base and the most solid and safest foundation for all, becomes to them an immediate and clear danger, not because its nature is changed, but because they fall headlong upon it by the weight of their bodies. So also that unwearied goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His unchanging nature  hurts no one indeed, but we ourselves by falling from on high and tending to the depths are the authors of our own death, or rather the very fall becomes death to the faller. For it says: <q>Woe to them for they have departed from Me: they shall be wasted because they have transgressed against Me;</q> and again: <q>Woe to them when I shall depart from them.</q> For <q>your own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> shall reprove you, and your <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> shall rebuke you. Know and see that it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and a bitter thing for you to have left the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> for <q>every man is bound by the cords of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  To whom this rebuke is aptly directed by the Lord: <q>Behold,</q> He says, <q>all you that kindle a fire, encompassed with flames, walk in the light of your fire and in the flames which you have kindled;</q> and again: <q>He that kindles iniquity, shall perish by it.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>How those who are on the way to perfection are truly humble, and feel that they always stand in need of God's grace.</strong></p>

<p>When then <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men feel that they are oppressed by the weight of earthly thoughts and fall away from their loftiness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and that they are led away against their will or rather without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it, into the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death, and (to pass over other matters) are kept back by those actions which I described above, which are good and right though earthly, from the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; they have something to groan over constantly to the Lord; they have something for which indeed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves, and in their contrition to profess themselves not in words only but in heart, sinners; and for this, while they continually ask of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> pardon for everything that day by day they commit when overcome by the weakness of the flesh, they should shed without ceasing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> tears of penitence; as they see that being involved even to the very end of their life in the very same troubles, with continual sorrow for which they are tried, they cannot even offer their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> without harassing thoughts. So then as they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by experience that through the hindrance of the burden of the flesh they cannot by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> strength reach the desired end, nor be united according to their heart's desire with that chief and highest good, but that they are led away from the vision of it captive to worldly things, they betake themselves to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Who justifies the ungodly,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352264"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;4:5</a></span> and cry out with the Apostle: O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Thanks be to God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note352265"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24-25</a></span> For they feel that they cannot perform the good that they would, but are ever falling into the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which they would not, and which they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, i.e., wandering thoughts and care for carnal things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>Explanation of the phrase: <q>For I delight in the law of God after the inner man,</q> etc.</strong></p>

<p>And they <q>delight</q> indeed <q>in the law of God after the inner man,</q> which soars above all visible things and ever strives to be united to God alone, but they <q>see another law in their members,</q> i.e., implanted in their natural <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> condition, which <q>resisting the law of their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q>  brings their thoughts into captivity to the forcible law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, compelling them to forsake that chief good and submit to earthly notions, which though they may appear necessary and useful when they are taken up in the interests of some religious want, yet when they are set against that good which fascinates the gaze of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, are seen by them to be bad and such as should be avoided, because by them in some way or other and for a short time they are drawn away from the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of that perfect bliss. For the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is really what the fall of its first father brought on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> by that fault of his, against which there was uttered this sentence by the most just Judge: <q>Cursed is the ground in your works; thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to you, and in the sweat of your brow shall you eat bread.</q>  This, I say, is the law, implanted in the members of all mortals, which resists the law of our mind and keeps it back from the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which, as the earth is cursed in our works after the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, begins to produce the thorns and thistles of thoughts, by the sharp pricks of which the natural seeds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are choked, so that without the sweat of our brow we cannot eat our bread which <q>comes down from heaven,</q> and which <q>strengthens man's heart.</q>  The whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> in general therefore is without exception subject to this law. For there is no one, however saintly, who does not take the bread mentioned above with the sweat of his brow and anxious efforts of his heart. But many rich men, as we see, are fed on that common bread without any sweat of their brow.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>Of this also: <q>But we know that the law is spiritual,</q> etc.</strong></p>

<p>And this law the Apostle also calls spiritual saying: <q>But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352269"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;7:14</a></span> For this law is spiritual which bids us eat in the sweat of our brow that <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bread which comes down from heaven</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352270"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;6:33</a></span> but that sale under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> makes us carnal. What, I ask, or whose is that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Doubtless Adam's, by whose fall and, if I may so say, ruinous transaction and fraudulent bargain we were sold. For when he was led astray by the persuasion of the serpent he brought all his descendants under the yoke of perpetual bondage, as they were alienated by taking the forbidden food. For this custom is generally observed between the buyer and seller, that one who wants to make himself over to the power of another, receives from his buyer a price for the loss of his liberty, and his consignment to perpetual slavery. And we can very plainly see that this took place between <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and the serpent. For by eating of the forbidden tree he received from the serpent the price of his liberty, and gave up his natural freedom and chose to give himself up to perpetual slavery to him from whom he had obtained the deadly price of the forbidden fruit; and thenceforth he was bound by this condition and not without reason subjected all the offspring of his posterity to perpetual service to him whose slave he had become. For what can any marriage in slavery produce but slaves? What then? Did that cunning and crafty buyer take away the rights of ownership from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and lawful lord? Not so. For neither did he overcome all God's property by the craft of a single act of deception so that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> lord lost his rights of ownership, who though the buyer himself was a rebel and a renegade, yet oppressed him with the yoke of slavery; but because the Creator had endowed all reasonable creatures with <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, he would not restore to their natural liberty against their will those who contrary to right had sold themselves by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of greedy <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Since anything that is contrary to goodness and fairness is abhorrent to Him who is the Author of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. For it would have been wrong for Him to have recalled the blessing of freedom granted, unfair for Him to have by His power oppressed man who was free, and by taking him captive, not to have allowed him to exercise the prerogative of the freedom he had received, as He was reserving his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for future ages, that in due season the fullness of the appointed time might be fulfilled. For it was right that his offspring should remain under the ancient conditions for so long a time, until by the price of His own blood the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord redeemed them from their original chains and set them free in the primeval state of liberty, though He was able even then to save them, but would not, because equity forbade Him to break the terms of His own decree. Would you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the reason for your being sold? Hear your Redeemer Himself proclaiming openly by Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>What is this bill of the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> of your mother with which I have put her away? Or who is My creditor to whom I sold you? Behold you are sold for your iniquities and for your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> have I put your mother away.</q> Would you also plainly see why when you were consigned to the yoke of slavery He would not redeem you by the might of His own power? Hear what He added to the former passage, and how He charges the same servants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with the reason for their <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> sale. <q>Is My hand shortened and become little that I cannot redeem, or is there no strength in Me to deliver?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352271"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;50:1-2</a></span> But what it is which is always standing in the way of His most powerful pity the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> shows when he says: <q>Behold the hand of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save, neither is His ear heavy that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have divided between you and your God and your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have hid His face from you that He should not hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352272"><a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;59:1-2</a></span> </p>

<p>Because then the original curse of God has made us carnal and condemned us to thorns and thistles, and our father has sold us by that unhappy bargain so that we cannot do the good that we would, while we are torn away from the recollection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Most High and forced to think on what belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, while burning with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of purity, we are often even against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> troubled by natural desires, which we would rather <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing about; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in our flesh there dwells no good thing <span class="stiki" id="note352273"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;7:18</a></span> viz., the perpetual and lasting peace of this meditation of which we have spoken; but there is brought about in our case that miserable and wretched <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, that when with the mind we want to serve the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since we never want to remove our gaze from the Divine brightness, yet surrounded as we are by carnal darkness we are forced by a kind of law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to tear ourselves away from the good which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, as we fall away from that lofty height of mind to earthly cares and thoughts, to which the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, i.e., the sentence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which the first delinquent received, has not without reason condemned us. And hence it is that the blessed Apostle, though he openly admits that he and all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are bound by the constraint of this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet boldly asserts that none of them will be condemned for this, saying: <q>There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus: for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352274"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;8:1-2</a></span> i.e., the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ day by day frees all his <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> from this law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death, under which they are constantly reluctantly <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to come, whenever they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the Lord for the forgiveness of their trespasses. You see then that it was in the person not of sinners but of those who are really <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and perfect, that the blessed Apostle gave utterance to this saying: <q>For I do not the good that I would, but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, that I do;</q> and: <q>I see another law in my members resisting the law of my mind and bringing me captive to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is in my members.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352275"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;7:19</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>An objection, that the saying: <q>For I do not the good that I would,</q> etc., applies to the persons neither of unbelievers nor of saints.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: We say that this does not apply to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> either of those who are involved in capital offenses, or of an Apostle and those who have advanced to his measure, but we think that it ought properly to be taken of those who after receiving the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, are anxious to keep themselves from carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> but, as ancient custom like a natural law rules most forcibly in their members, they are carried away to the ingrained <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For the custom and frequency of sinning becomes like a natural law, which, implanted in the man's weak members, leads the feelings of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is not yet instructed in all the pursuits of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but is still, if I may say so, of an uninstructed and tender <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, captive to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and subjecting them by an ancient law to death, brings them under the yoke of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that rules over them, not suffering them to obtain the good of purity which they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but rather forcing them to do the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>The answer to the objection raised.</strong></p>

<p>Theonas: Your notion does not come to much; as you yourselves have actually now begun to maintain that this cannot possibly stand in the person of those who are out and out sinners, but that it properly applies to those who are trying to keep themselves clear from carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And since you have already separated these from the number of sinners, it follows that you must shortly admit them into the ranks of the faithful and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. For what kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> do you say that those can commit, from which, if they are involved in them after the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, they can be freed by the daily <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ? Or of what body of death are we to think that the Apostle said: <q>Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Thanks be to God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note352276"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24-25</a></span> Is it not clear, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> compels you yourselves also to admit, that it is spoken not of those members of capital crimes, by which the wages of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death are gained; viz., <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, fornication, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, thefts and robberies, but of that body before mentioned, which the daily <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ assists? For whoever after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God falls into that death, must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he will either have to be cleansed, not by the daily <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, i.e., an easy forgiveness, which our Lord when at any moment He is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to, is wont to grant to our <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, but by a lifelong affliction of penitence and penal sorrow, or else will be hereafter consigned to the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> for them, as the same Apostle thus declares: <q>Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor defilers of themselves with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, nor thieves, nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners shall possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352277"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:9-10</a></span> Or what is that law warring in our members which resists the law of our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and when it has led us resisting but captives to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death, and has made us serve it with the flesh, nevertheless suffers us to serve the law of God with the mind? For I do not suppose that this law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> denotes crimes or can be taken of the offenses mentioned above, of which if a man is guilty he does not serve the law of God with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, from which law he must first have departed in heart before he is guilty of any of them with the flesh. For what is it to serve the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but to do what is commanded by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? What sort of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> then is it to which so great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and perfection feels that it is captive, and yet doubts not that it will be freed from it by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, saying: <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Thanks be to God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord</q>? What law, I ask, will you maintain to be implanted in our members, which, withdrawing us from the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and bringing us into captivity to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, could make us wretched rather than guilty so that we should not be consigned to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, but still as it were sigh for the unbroken joys of bliss, and, seeking for a helper who shall restore us to it, exclaim with the Apostle: <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</q> For what is it to be led captive to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but to continue to perform and commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Or what other chief good can be given which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> cannot fulfil, except that in comparison with which, as we said above, everything else is not good? Indeed we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many things in this world are good, and chiefly, modesty, continence, sobriety, humility, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, mercy, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>: but all of these things fail to come up to that chief good, and can be done I say not by <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but even by ordinary folk; and, those by whom they are not done, are either chastised with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, or are set free by great exertions, as was said above, of penitence, and not by the daily <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. It remains then for us to admit that this saying of the Apostle is rightly applied only to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, who day after day falling under this law, which we described, of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not of crimes, are secure of their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and not precipitated into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but, as has often been said, are drawn away from the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of God to the misery of bodily thoughts, and are often deprived of the blessing of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bliss. For if they felt that by this law of their members they were bound daily to crimes, they would complain of the loss not of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> but of innocence, and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> would not say: <q>O wretched man that I am,</q> but <q>Impure,</q> or <q>Wicked man that I am,</q> and he would wish to be rid not of the body of this death, i.e., this mortal state, but of the crimes and misdeeds of this flesh. But because by reason of his state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty he felt that he was captive, i.e., led away to carnal cares and anxieties which the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death causes, he groans over this law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> under which against his will he had fallen, and at once has recourse to Christ and is saved by the present redemption of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Whatever of anxiety therefore that law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which naturally produces the thorns and thistles of mortal thoughts and cares, has caused to spring up in the ground of the Apostle's breast, that the law of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> at once plucks up. <q>For the law,</q> says he, <q>of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352278"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;8:2</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>What is the body of sin.</strong></p>

<p>This then is that body of death from which we cannot escape, pent in which those who are perfect, who have tasted <q>how gracious the Lord is,</q>  daily feel with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <q>how bad for himself and bitter it is for a man to depart from the Lord his God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352280"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse19">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:19</a></span> This is the body of death which restrains us from the heavenly vision and drags us back to earthly things, which causes men while singing Psalms and kneeling in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to have their thoughts filled with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> figures, or conversations, or business, or unnecessary actions. This is the body of death, owing to which those, who would emulate the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and who long to cling continually to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet are unable to arrive at the perfection of this good, because the body of death stands in their way, but they do the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that they would not, i.e., they are dragged down in their minds even to the things which have nothing to do with their advance and perfection in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Finally that the blessed Apostle might clearly denote that he said this of saintly and perfect men, and those like himself, he in a way points with his finger to himself and at once proceeds: <q>And so I myself,</q> i.e., I who say this, lay bare the secrets of my own not another's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. This mode of speech at any rate the Apostle is familiarly accustomed to use, whenever he wants to point specially to himself, as here: <q>I, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, myself beseech you by the mildness and modesty of Christ;</q> and again: <q>except that I myself was not burdensome to you;</q> and once more: <q>But be it so: I myself did not burden you;</q> and elsewhere: <q>I, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, myself say unto you: if you be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Christ shall profit you nothing;</q> and to the Romans: <q>For I could wish that I myself were Anathema from Christ for my brethren.</q>  But it cannot unreasonably be taken in this way, that <q>And so I myself</q> is expressly said with emphasis, i.e., I whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be an Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whom you venerate with the utmost respect, whom you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be of the highest character and perfect, and one in whom Christ speaks, though with the mind I serve the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet with the flesh I confess that I serve the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, i.e., by the occupations of my <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> condition am sometimes dragged down from heavenly to earthly things and the height of my mind is brought down to the level of care for <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> matters. And by this law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> I find that at every moment I am so taken captive that although I persist in my immovable longing around the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet in no way can I escape the power of this captivity, unless I always fly to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Saviour.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p><strong>How all the saints have confessed with truth that they were unclean and sinful.</strong></p>

<p>And therefore with daily sighs all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> grieve over this weakness of their nature and while they search into their shifting thoughts and the secrets and inmost recesses of their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, cry out in entreaty: <q>Enter not into judgment with Your servant, for in Your sight shall no man living be justified;</q> and this: <q>Who will boast that he has a chaste heart? Or who will have confidence that he is pure from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</q> and again: <q>There is not a righteous man upon earth that does good and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not;</q> and this also: <q>Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his faults?</q>  And so they have recognized that man's righteousness is weak and imperfect and always needs God's mercy, so that one of those whose iniquities and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> God purged away with the live coal of His word sent from the altar, after that marvellous vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after his view of the Seraphim on high and the revelation of heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, said: <q>Woe is me! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352283"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;6:5</a></span> And I fancy that perhaps even then he would not have felt the uncleanness of his lips, unless it had been given him to recognize the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and complete purity of perfection by the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at the sight of Whom he suddenly became aware of his own uncleanness, of which he had previously been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. For when he says: <q>Woe is me! For I am a man of unclean lips,</q> he shows that his confession that follows refers to his own lips, and not to the uncleanness of the people: <q>and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.</q> But even when in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> he confesses the uncleanness of all sinners, he embraces in his general supplication not only the mass of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> but also of the good, saying: <q>Behold You are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>: in them we have been always, and we shall be saved. We are all become as one unclean, and all our righteousnesses as filthy rags.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352284"><a href="../bible/isa064.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;64:5-6</a></span> What, I ask, could be clearer than this saying, in which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> includes not one only but all our righteousnesses and, looking round on all things that are considered unclean and disgusting, because he could find nothing in the life of men fouler or more unclean, chose to compare them to filthy rags. In vain then is the sharpness of a nagging objection raised against this perfectly clear <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as a little while back you said: <q>If no one is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, then no one is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; and if no one is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, then no one will be saved.</q>  For the puzzle of this question can be solved by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> testimony. <q>Behold,</q> he says, <q>You are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>,</q> i.e., when You rejected our <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of heart or our carelessness, and deprive us of Your aid, at once the abyss of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> swallowed us up, as if one should say to the bright substance of the sun: Behold you have set, and at once murky darkness covered us. And yet though he here says that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and have not only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> but also have always remained in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he does not altogether despair of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> but adds: <q>In them we have been always, and we shall be saved.</q> This saying: <q>Behold You are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>,</q> I will compare to that one of the Apostle's: <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</q> Again this that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> subjoins: <q>In them we have been always, and we shall be saved,</q> corresponds to the following words of the Apostle: <q>Thanks be to God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q> In the same way also this passage of the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Woe is me! For I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips,</q> seems to agree with the words quoted above: <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</q> And what follows in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. <q>And behold there flew to me one of the Seraphim, having in his hand a coal (or stone) which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. And he touched my mouth and said: Lo, with this I have touched your lips, and your iniquity is taken away and your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is purged,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352286"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;6:6-7</a></span> is just what seems to have fallen from the mouth of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who says: <q>Thanks be to God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q> You see then how all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> confess not so much in the person of the people as in their own that they are sinners, and yet by no means despair of their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but look for full justification (which they do not hope that they cannot obtain by virtue of the state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty) from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of the Lord.</p>

<p>But that no one however <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> is in this life free from trespasses and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we are told also by the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, who gave His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the form of the perfect <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and among those other sublime and sacred commands, which as they were only given to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and perfect cannot apply to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and unbelievers, He bade this to be inserted: <q>And forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352287"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> If then this is offered as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and by <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as we ought without the shadow of a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, who can be found so obstinate and impudent, so puffed up with the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> own rage, as to maintain that he is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and not only to think himself greater than <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but also to charge the Saviour Himself with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or folly, as if He either did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that some men could be free from debts, or was idly teaching those whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to stand in no need of the remedy of that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>? But since all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who altogether keep the commands of their King, say every day <q>Forgive us our debts,</q> if they speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> there is indeed no one free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but if they speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, it is equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that they are not free from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. Wherefore also that most wise Ecclesiastes reviewing in his mind all the actions and purposes of men declares without any exception: <q>that there is not a righteous man upon earth, that does good and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352288"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse21">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:21</a></span> i.e., no one ever could or ever will be found on this earth so <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, so diligent, so earnest as to be able continually to cling to that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and unique good, and not day after day to feel that he is drawn aside from it and fails. But still though he maintains that he cannot be free from wrong doing, yet none the less we must not deny that he is righteous.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p><strong>How even in the hour of prayer it is almost impossible to avoid sin.</strong></p>

<p>Whoever then ascribes sinlessness to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> must fight against no idle words but the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> which is on our side, and then only should maintain that he is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when he finds that he is not torn away from this highest good: nay rather, whoever considering his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, to say no more, finds that he has celebrated even one single service without the distraction of a single word or deed or thought, may say that he is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Further because we admit that the discursive lightness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind cannot get rid of these idle and empty things, we thus consequently confess with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that we are not without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For with whatever care a man tries to keep his heart, he can never, owing to the resistance of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the flesh, keep it according to the desire of his spirit. For however far the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind may have advanced and progressed towards a finer purity of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, so much the more will it see itself to be unclean, as it were in the mirror of its purity, because while the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> raises itself for a loftier vision and as it looks forth yearns for greater things than it performs, it is sure always to despise as inferior and worthless the things in which it is mixed up. Since a keener sight notices more; and a blameless life produces greater sorrow when found fault with; and amendment of life, and earnest striving after goodness multiplies groans and sighs. For no one can rest content with that stage to which he has advanced, and however much a man may be purified in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so much the more does he see himself to be foul, and find grounds for humiliation rather than for <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and, however swiftly he may climb to greater heights, so much more does he see above him whither he is tending. Finally that chosen Apostle <q>whom Jesus loved,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352289"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;13:23</a></span> who lay on His bosom, uttered this saying as if from the heart of the Lord: <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we deceive ourselves and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352290"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> And so if when we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we have not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that is Christ, in us, what good do we do except to prove ourselves by this very profession, criminals and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> among sinners?</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p><strong>From whom we can learn the destruction of sin and perfection of goodness.</strong></p>

<p>Lastly if you would like to investigate more thoroughly whether it is possible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to attain sinlessness, from whom can we more clearly learn this than from those who <q>have crucified the flesh with its faults and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>,</q> and to whom <q>the world is really crucified</q>?  Who though they have not only utterly eradicated all faults from their hearts, but also are trying to shut out even the thought and recollection of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet still day after day faithfully maintain that they cannot even for a single hour be free from spot of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p><strong>That although we acknowledge that we cannot be without sin, yet still we ought not to suspend ourselves from the Lord's Communion.</strong></p>

<p>Yet we ought not to suspend ourselves from the Lord's Communion because we confess ourselves sinners, but should more and more eagerly hasten to it for the healing of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and purifying of our spirit, and seek the rather a remedy for our wounds with humility of mind and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as considering ourselves unworthy to receive so great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Otherwise we cannot worthily receive the Communion even once a year, as some do, who live in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and so regard the dignity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and value of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as to think that none but <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and spotless <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should venture to receive them, and not rather that they would make us <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and pure by taking them. And these thereby fall into greater presumption and arrogance than what they seem to themselves to avoid, because at the time when they do receive them, they consider that they are worthy to receive them. But it is much better to receive them every Sunday for the healing of our infirmities, with that humility of heart, whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and confess that we can never touch those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> worthily, than to be puffed up by a foolish persuasion of heart, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that at the year's end we are worthy to receive them. Wherefore that we may be able to grasp this and hold it fruitfully, let us the more earnestly implore the Lord's mercy to help us to perform this, which is learned not like other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> arts, by some previous verbal explanation, but rather by experience and action leading the way; and which also unless it is often considered and hammered out in the Conferences of spiritual <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and anxiously sifted by daily experience and trial of it, will either become obsolete through carelessness or perish by idle forgetfulness.</p>
