<h1>Conference 24</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>CONFERENCE OF ABBOT ABRAHAM. ON MORTIFICATION.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>How we laid bare the secrets of our thoughts to Abbot Abraham.</strong></p>

<p>This twenty-fourth Conference of Abbot <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>  is by the favour of Christ produced, which concludes the traditions and decisions of all the Elders; and when by the aid of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> it has been finished, as the number <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> corresponds to that of the four and twenty Elders who are said in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apocalypse <span class="stiki" id="note352293"><a href="../bible/rev004.htm#verse4">Revelation&nbsp;4:4</a></span> to offer their crowns to the Lamb, we think that we shall have paid the debt of all our promises. And henceforth if these four and twenty Elders of ours have been crowned with any <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for the sake of their teaching, they shall with bowed heads offer it to the Lamb who was slain for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world: for He it was Who vouchsafed for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of His name to grant to them such exalted feelings and to us whatever words were needful to set forth such profound thoughts. And the merits of His gift must be referred to the Author of all good, to whom the more is owed, as the more is paid. Therefore with anxious confession we laid before this <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> the impulse of our thoughts, whereby we were urged by daily perplexities of our mind to return to our country and revisit our kinsfolk. For from this the greatest reason for our desire sprang, because we remembered that our kinsfolk were endowed with such <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and goodness that we felt sure that they would never interfere with our purpose, and we constantly reflected, that we should gain more good out of their earnestness, and should be hampered by no cares about bodily matters, and no trouble in providing food, as they would gladly minister abundantly to the supply of all our wants, and besides this we were feeding our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> on the hope of empty joys, as we thought that we should gain the greatest good from the conversion  of many, who were to be turned to the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by our example and instructions. Then besides this the very spot, where was the ancestral possession of our forefathers, and the delightful pleasantness of the neighbourhood was painted before our eyes, how pleasantly and suitably it stretched away to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, so that the recesses of the woods would not only delight the heart of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, but would also furnish him with a plentiful supply of food.  And when we explained all this to the aforesaid old man, in a straightforward way, according to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and showed by our copious tears that we could no longer resist the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the impulse, unless the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God came to our rescue by the healing which he could give, he waited for a long time in silence and at last sighed deeply and said:</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>How the old man exposed our errors.</strong></p>

<p>The feebleness of your ideas shows that you have not yet renounced worldly desires nor mortified your former <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>. For as the wandering character of your desires testifies to the sloth of your heart, this pilgrimage and absence from your kinsfolk, which you ought rather to endure with your heart, you <em>do</em> endure only with the flesh. For all these things would have been buried and altogether driven out of your hearts, if you had got hold of the right method of renunciation, and the main reason for the solitude in which we dwell. And so I see that you are labouring under that infirmity of sluggishness, which is thus described in Proverbs: <q>Every sluggard is always desiring something;</q> and again: <q>Desires kill the <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a>.</q>  For in our case too these supplies of worldly conveniences, which you have described, would not be wanting, if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that they were appropriate to our calling, or thought that we could get out of those delights and pleasures as much profit as that which is gained from this squalor of the country and bodily affliction. Nor are we so deprived of the solace of our kinsfolk, that those who delight to support us with their substance should fail us, were it not that this saying of the Saviour meets us and excludes everything that contributes to the support of this flesh, as He says: <q>He who does not leave (or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>) father and mother and children and brethren cannot be My <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352297"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;14:26</a></span> But if we were altogether deprived of the protection of our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, the services of the princes of this world would not be wanting, as they would most thankfully <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to minister to our necessities with prompt liberality. And supported by their bounty, we should be free from the care of preparing food, were it not that this curse of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> terribly frightened us. For <q>Cursed,</q> he says, <q>is the man that puts his hope in man;</q> and: <q>Put not your trust in princes.</q>  We should also at any rate place our cells on the banks of the river Nile and have water at our very doors, so as not to be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to carry it on our necks for four miles, were it not that the blessed Apostle rendered us indefatigable in enduring this labour, and cheered us by his words, saying: <q>Every one shall receive his own reward according to his labour.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352299"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:8</a></span> Nor are we <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that there are even in our country some pleasant recesses, where plenty of fruits, and pleasant gardens, and fertile ground would furnish the food we need with the slightest bodily efforts on our part, were it not that we were afraid lest that reproach might apply to us, which is directed against the rich man in the gospel: <q>Because you have received your consolation in this life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352300"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;16:25</a></span> But as we despise all these things and scorn them together with all the pleasures of this world, we delight only in this squalor, and prefer to all luxuries this dreadful and vast desert, and cannot compare any riches of a fertile soil to these barren sands, as we pursue no temporal gains of this body, but the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rewards of the spirit. For it is but little for a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> to have once made his renunciation, i.e., in the early days of his conversion to have disregarded the present world, unless he continues to renounce it daily. For to the very end of this life we must with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> say this: <q>And I have not desired the day of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352301"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse16">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:16</a></span> Wherefore also the Lord says in the gospel: <q>If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352302"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;9:23</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>Of the character of the districts which anchorites ought to seek.</strong></p>

<p>And therefore by him who is exercising anxious care over the purity of his inner man, those districts should be sought, which do not by their fruitfulness and fertility invite his mind to the trouble of cultivating them, nor drive him forth from his fixed and immovable position in his cell, and force him to go forth to some work in the open air, and so, his thoughts being as it were poured forth openly, scatter to the winds all his concentration of mind and all the keenness of his vision of his aim. And this cannot be guarded against or seen by anyone at all however careful and watchful, except one who continually keeps his body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shut up and enclosed in walls, that, like a splendid fisherman, looking out for food for himself by the apostolic art, he may eagerly and without moving catch the swarms of thoughts swimming in the calm depths of his heart, and surveying with curious eye the depths as from a high rock, may sagaciously and cunningly decide what he ought to lure to himself by his saving hook, and what he can neglect and reject as bad and nasty fishes.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>What sorts of work should be chosen by solitaries.</strong></p>

<p>Everyone therefore who constantly perseveres in this watchfulness will effectually fulfil what is very plainly expressed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Habakkuk: <q>I will stand upon my watch, and ascend upon the rock, and will look out to see what He shall say to me, and what I may answer to Him that reproves me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352303"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse1">Habakkuk&nbsp;2:1</a></span> And how difficult and tiresome this is, is very clearly shown by the experience of those who live in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Calamus or Porphyrion.  For though they are separated from all the cities and dwellings of men by a longer stretch of desert than the wilderness of Scete (since by penetrating seven or eight days' journey into the recesses of the vast wilderness, they scarcely arrive at their hiding places and cells) yet because there they are devoted to agriculture and not in the least confined to the cloister, whenever they come to these squalid districts in which we are living, or to Scete, they are annoyed by such harassing thoughts and such anxiety of mind that, as if they were beginners and men who had never given the slightest attention to the exercises of solitude, they cannot endure the life of the cells and the peace and quietness of them, and are at once driven forth and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave them, as if they were inexperienced and novices. For they have not learned to still the motions of the inner man, and to quell the tempests of their thoughts by anxious care and persevering efforts, as, toiling day after day in work in the open air, they are moving about all day long in empty space, not only in the flesh but also in heart; and pour forth their thoughts openly as the body moves hither and there. And therefore they do not notice the folly of their mind in longing for many things, nor can they put a check upon its vague discursiveness; and as they cannot bear sorrow of spirit they think that the fact of a continuance of silence is unendurable, and those who are never tired by hard work in the country, are beaten by silence and worn out by the length of their rest.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>That anxiety of heart is made worse rather than better by restlessness of body.</strong></p>

<p>Nor is it wonderful if one who lives in a cell, having his thoughts collected together as it were in a narrow cloister, is oppressed by a multitude of anxieties, which break out with the man himself from the confinement of the dwelling, and at once dash here and there like wild horses. But while they are now roaming at large from their stalls, for the moment some short and sad solace is enjoyed: but when, after the body has returned to its own cell, the whole troop of thoughts retires again to its proper home, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of chronic licence gives rise to worse pangs. Those then who are unable and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> how to struggle against the promptings of their own fancies, when they are harassed in their cell, by accidie attacking their bosom more violently than usual, if they relax their strict rule and allow themselves the liberty of going out oftener, will arouse a worse plague against themselves by means of this which they fancy is a remedy: just as men fancy that they can check the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of an inward fever by a draught of the coldest water, though it is a fact that by it its fire is inflamed rather than quenched, as a far worse attack follows after the momentary alleviation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>A comparison showing how a monk ought to keep guard over his thoughts.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk's</a> whole attention should thus be fixed on one point, and the rise and circle of all his thoughts be vigorously restricted to it; viz., to the recollection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as when a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is anxious to raise on high a vault of a round arch, must constantly draw a line round from its exact centre, and in accordance with the sure standard it gives discover by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of building all the evenness and roundness required. But if anyone tries to finish it without ascertaining its centre&mdash; though with the utmost confidence in his art and ability, it is impossible for him to keep the circumference even, without any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, or to find out simply by looking at it how much he has taken off by his mistake from the beauty of real roundness, unless he always has recourse to that test of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and by its decision corrects the inner and outer edge of his work, and so finishes the large and lofty pile to the exact point.  So also our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, unless by working round the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Lord alone as an immovably fixed centre, through all the circumstances of our works and contrivances, it either fits or rejects the character of all our thoughts by the excellent compasses, if I may so say, of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, will never by excellent skill build up the structure of that spiritual edifice of which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is the architect, nor possess that beautiful house, which the blessed David desired in his heart to show to the Lord and said: <q>I have loved the beauty of Your house and the place of the dwelling of Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>;</q>  but will without foresight raise in his heart a house that is not beautiful, and that is unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, one that will presently fall, and so will receive no <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from the reception of the blessed Inhabitant, but will be miserably destroyed by the fall of his building.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>A question why the neighbourhood of our kinsfolk is considered to interfere with us, whereas it does not interfere in the case of those living in Egypt.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: It is a very useful and needful rule that is given for the kind of works that can be done within the cells. For we have often <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the value of this not only by the example of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, based on the imitation of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but also by our own experience. But it is not sufficiently clear why we ought so thoroughly to avoid the neighbourhood of our kinsfolk, which you did not reject altogether. For if we see you, blamelessly walking in all the way of perfection, and not only dwelling in your own country but some of you having not even retired far from their own village, why should that which does not hurt you be considered bad for us?</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>The answer that all things are not suitable for all men.</strong></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: Sometimes we see bad precedents taken from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. For if a man ventures to do the same thing as another, but not with the same mind and purpose, or not with equal goodness, he will immediately fall into the snares of deception and death through the very things from which others gain the fruit of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life: As that strong armed lad matched with the warlike giant in the combat would certainly have found, if he had been clad in the heavy armour of Saul fit only for men; and that by which one of stronger age would have laid low countless hosts of foes, would only have brought certain danger to the stripling, had he not with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> discretion chosen the sort of weapons suitable to his youth, and armed himself against his foul foe not with breastplate and shield, with which he saw that others were equipped, but with those weapons with which he was able to fight. Wherefore it is right for each one of us first to consider carefully the measure of his powers and in accordance with its limits, to choose what system he pleases, because though all are good, yet all things cannot be fit for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For we do not assert that because the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite's</a> life is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is therefore suited for everybody: for by many it is felt to be not only useless, but even injurious. Nor because we are right in taking up the system of the C&oelig;nobium and the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and praiseworthy care of the brethren, do we therefore consider that it ought to be followed by everybody. So also the fruits of the care of strangers are very plentiful, but this cannot be taken up by everybody without loss of patience. Further, the systems of your country and of this must first be weighed against each other; and then the powers of men gathered from the constant occurrence of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> must be severally weighed in the opposite scales. For it may happen that what is difficult or impossible for a man of one nation in the case of others is somehow turned by ingrained habit into nature: just as some nations, separated by a wide difference of region, can bear tremendous force of cold or heat of the sun without any covering of the body, which certainly others who have no experience of that inclement sky, could not possibly endure, however strong they may be. So also do you who with the utmost efforts of mind and body are trying in this district to get the better of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of your country in many respects, diligently consider whether in those regions which, as report says, are frozen, and bound by the cold of excessive unbelief, you could endure this nakedness, if I may so term it. For to us the fact that our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life is of long standing has almost naturally imparted this <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in our purpose, and if we see that you are our equals in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and constancy, you in like manner need not shun the neighbourhood of your kinsfolk and brethren.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>That those need not fear the neighbourhood of their kinsfolk, who can emulate the mortification of Abbot Apollos.</strong></p>

<p>But that you may be able fairly to measure the amount of your strength by a certain test of strictness I will point out to you what was done by a certain old man; viz., Abbot Apollos  that if your secret scrutiny of your heart decides that you are not behind this man in purpose and goodness, you may venture on remaining in your country and living near your kinsfolk without detriment to your purpose or injury to your mode of life, and be sure that neither the feeling of nearness nor your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the district can interfere with the strictness of this <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> lot,  which not only your own will but the needs also of your pilgrimage enforce upon you in this country. When then his own brother had come to this old man, whom we have mentioned, in the dead of night, begging him to come out for a little while from his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, to help him to rescue an ox, which as he sadly complained had stuck in the mire of a swamp a little way off, because he could not possibly rescue it alone, Abbot Apollos stolidly replied to his entreaties: <q>Why did you not ask our younger brother who was nearer to you as you passed by than I?</q> and when the other, thinking that he had forgotten the death of his brother who had been long ago buried, and that he was almost weak in his mind from excessive abstinence and continual solitude, replied: <q>How could I summon one who died fifteen years ago?</q> Abbot Apollos said: <q>Don't you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I too have been dead to this world for twenty years, and that I can't from my tomb in this cell give you any assistance in what belongs to the affairs of this present life? And Christ is so far from allowing me ever so little to relax my purpose of mortification on which I have entered, for extricating your ox, that He did not even permit the very shortest intermission of it for my father's funeral, which would have been undertaken much more readily properly and piously.</q> And so do ye now search out the secrets of your breast and carefully consider whether you also can continually preserve such strictness of mind with regard to your kinsfolk, and when you find that you are like him in this mortification of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, then at last you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in the same way the neighbourhood of your kinsfolk and brothers will not hurt you, when, I mean, you hold that though they are very close to you, you are dead to them, in such a way that you suffer neither them to be benefited by your assistance, nor yourselves to be relaxed by duties towards them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>A question whether it is bad for a monk to have his wants supplied by his kinsfolk.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: On this subject you have certainly left no room for any further uncertainty. For we are sure that we cannot possibly keep up our present wretched garb, or our daily going barefoot in their neighbourhood, and that there we should not even procure with the same labour what is necessary for our sustenance, as here we are actually <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to fetch our water on our necks for three miles. For shame on our part as well as on theirs would not in the least allow us to do this before them. However how will it hurt our plan of life if we are altogether set free from anxiety on the score of preparing our food, by being supplied by them with all things, and so give ourselves up simply to reading and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that by the removal of that labour with which we are now distracted we may devote ourselves more earnestly to spiritual interests alone?</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>The answer stating what Saint Antony laid down on this matter.</strong></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: I will not give you my own opinion against this, but that of the blessed Antony, whereby he confounded the laziness of a certain brother (overcome by this luke-warmness which you describe) in such a way as also to cut the knot of your subject. For when one came as I said to the aforesaid old man, and said that the Anchorite system was not at all to be admired, declaring that it required greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> for a man to practise what belongs to perfection living among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> rather than in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, the blessed Antony asked where he lived himself, and when he said that he lived close to his relations, and boasted that by their provision he was set free from all care and anxiety of daily work, and gave himself up ceaselessly and solely to reading and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> without any distraction of spirit, once more the blessed Antony said: <q>Tell me, my good friend, whether you grieve with their griefs and misfortunes, and in the same way <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in their good fortune?</q> He confessed that he shared in them both. To whom the old man: <q>You should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> said he, <q>that in the world to come also you will be judged in the lot of those with whom in this life you have been affected by sharing in their gain or loss, or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or sorrow.</q> And not satisfied with this statement the blessed Antony entered on a still wider field of discussion, saying: <q>This mode of life and this most lukewarm condition not only strike you with that damage of which I spoke (though you do not feel it now, when somehow you say in accordance with that saying in Proverbs: 'They strike me but I am not grieved: and they mocked me but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not;' or this that is said in the Prophet: 'And strangers have devoured his strength, but he himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not' ), because day after day they ceaselessly drag down your mind to earthly things, and change it in accordance with the variations of chance; but also because they defraud you of the fruits of your hands and the due reward of your own exertions, as they do not suffer you to be supported by what these supply, or to procure your daily food for yourself with your own hands, according to the rule of the blessed Apostle, as he when giving his last charge to the heads of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ephesus, asserts that though he was occupied with the sacred duties of preaching the gospel yet he provided not only for himself, but also for those who were prevented by necessary duties with regard to his ministry, saying: 'You yourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these hands have ministered to my necessities and to the necessities of those who were with me.' But to show that he did this as a pattern to be useful to us he says elsewhere: 'We were not idle among you; neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing, but in labour and in toil we worked night and day lest we should be chargeable to any of you. Not as if we had not power; but that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you, to imitate us.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>Of the value of work and the harm of idleness.</strong></p>

<p>And so though we also might have the protection of our kinsfolk, yet we have preferred his abstinence to all riches, and have chosen to procure our daily bodily sustenance by our own exertions rather than rely on the sure provision made by our relations, having less inclination for idle meditation on <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture of which you have spoken, and that fruitless attendance to reading than to this laborious poverty. And certainly we should most gladly pursue the former, if the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had taught us by their examples that it was better for us, or the rules of the Elders had laid it down for our good. But you must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are affected by this no less than by that harm of which I spoke above, because though your body may be sound and lusty, yet you are supported by another's contributions, a thing which properly belongs only to the feeble. For certainly the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, except only that class of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who live in accordance with the Apostle's command by the daily labours of their own hands, looks for the charity of another's compassion. Wherefore it is clear that not only those who boast that they themselves are supported either by the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of their relations or the labours of their servants or the produce of their farms, but also the kings of this world are supported by charity. This at any rate is embraced in the definition of our predecessors, who have laid down that anything that is taken for the requirements of daily food which has not been procured and prepared by the labour of our own hands, ought to be referred to charity, as the Apostle teaches, who altogether forbids the help of another's bounty to the idle and says: <q>If a man does not work, neither let him eat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352311"><a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> These words the blessed Antony used against some one, and instructed us also by the example of his teaching, to shun the pernicious allurements of our relations and of all who provide the needful charity for our food as well as the delights of a pleasant home, and to prefer to all the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of this world sandy wastes horrid with the barrenness of nature, and districts overwhelmed by living incrustations, and for that reason subject to no control or dominion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so that we should not only avoid the society of men for the sake of a pathless waste, but also that the character of a fruitful soil may never entice us to the distractions of cultivating it, whereby the mind would be recalled from the chief service of the heart, and rendered useless for spiritual aims.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><strong>A story of a barber's payments, introduced for the sake of recognizing the devil's illusions.</strong></p>

<p>For as you hope that you can save others also, and are eager to return to your country with the hope of greater gain, hear also on this subject a story of Abbot Macarius, very neatly and prettily invented, which he also gave to a man in a tumult of similar desires, to cure him by a most appropriate story. <q>There was,</q> said he, <q>in a certain city a very clever barber, who used to shave everybody for three pence and by getting this poor and wretched sum for his work, out of this same amount used to procure what was required for his daily food, and after having taken all care of his body, used every day to put a hundred pence into his pocket. But while he was diligently amassing this gain, he heard that in a city a long way off each man paid the barber a shilling as his pay. And when he found this out, 'how long,' said he, 'shall I be satisfied with this beggary, so as to get with my labour a pay of three pence, when by going there I might amass riches by a large gain of shillings?' And so at once taking with him the implements of his art, and using up in the expense all that he had got together and saved during a long time, he made his way with great difficulty to that most lucrative city. And there on the day of his arrival, he received from everyone the pay for his labour in accordance with what he had heard, and at eventide seeing that he had gained a large number of shillings he went in delight to the butcher's to buy the food he wanted for his supper. And when he began to purchase it for a large sum of shillings he spent on a tiny bit of meat all the shillings that he had gained, and did not take home a surplus of even a single penny. And when he saw that his gains were thus used up every day so that he not only failed to put by anything but could scarcely get what he required for his daily food, he thought over the matter with himself and said: 'I will go back to my city, and once more, seek those very moderate profits, from which, when all my bodily wants were satisfied, a daily surplus gave a growing sum to support my old age; which, though it seemed small and trifling, yet by being constantly increased was amounting to no slight sum. In fact that gain of coppers was more profitable to me than is this nominal one of shillings from which not only is there nothing over to be laid by, but the necessities of my daily food are scarcely met.'</q> And therefore it is better for us with unbroken continuance to aim at this very slender profit in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, from which no secular cares, no worldly distractions, no <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of vainglory and vanity can detract, and which the pressure of no daily wants can lessen (for <q>a small thing that the righteous has is better than great riches of the ungodly</q> ) rather than to pursue those larger profits which even if they are procured by the most valuable conversion of many, are yet absorbed by the claims of secular life and the daily leakage of distractions. For, as Solomon says, <q>Better is a single handful with rest than both hands full with labour and vexation of mind.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352313"><a href="../bible/ecc004.htm#verse6">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;4:6</a></span> And in these allusions and inconveniences all that are at all weak are sure to be entangled, as while they are even doubtful of their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and themselves stand in need of the teaching and instruction of others, they are incited by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> tricks to convert and guide others, and as, even if they succeed in gaining any advantage from the conversion of some, they waste by their impatience and rude manners whatever they have gained. For that will happen to them which is described by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Haggai: <q>And he that gathers riches, puts them into a bag with holes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352314"><a href="../bible/hag001.htm#verse6">Haggai&nbsp;1:6</a></span> For indeed a man puts his gains into a bag with holes, if he loses by want of self control and daily distractions of mind whatever he appears to gain by the conversion of others. And so it results that while they fancy that they can make larger profits by the instruction of others, they are actually deprived of their own improvement. For <q>There are who make themselves out rich though possessing nothing, and there are who <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves amid great riches;</q> and: <q>Better is a man who serves himself in a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> station than one who gains <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for himself and wants bread.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>A question how such wrong notions can creep into us.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: Very aptly has your discussion shown the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of these illusions by this illustration: but we should like in the same way to be taught its origin and how to cure it, and we are equally anxious to learn how this deception has taken hold of us. For everybody must see that no one at all can apply remedies to ill health except one who has already diagnosed the actual origin of the disease.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>The answer on the threefold movement of the soul.</strong></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: Of all faults there is one source and origin, but different names are assigned to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and corruptions in accordance with the character of that part, or member, if I may so call it, which has been injuriously affected in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: As is sometimes also shown by the case of bodily diseases, in which though the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is one and the same, yet there is a division into different kinds of maladies in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the member affected. For when the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of a noxious moisture has seized on the body's citadel, i.e., the head, it brings about a feeling of headache, but when it affects the ears or eyes, it passes into the malady of earache or ophthalmia: when it spreads to the joints and the extremities of the hands it is called the gout in the joints or hands; but when it descends to the extremities of the feet, its name is changed and it is termed podagra: and the noxious moisture which is originally one and the same is described by as many names as there are separate members which it affects. In the same way to pass from visible to invisible things, we should hold that the tendency to each fault exists in the parts and, if I may use the expression, members of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And, as some very wise men have laid down that its powers are threefold, either what is <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>, i.e., reasonable, or <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>, i.e., irascible, or <span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9; &#x03B8;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>, i.e., subject to desire, is sure to be troubled by some assault. When then the force of noxious passion takes possession of anyone by reason of these feelings, the name of the fault is given to it in accordance with the part affected. For if the plague of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has infested its rational parts, it will produce the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of vainglory, conceit, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, presumption, strife, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. &nbsp;If it has wounded the irascible feelings, it will give birth to rage, impatience, sulkiness, accidie, pusillanimity and cruelty. If it has affected that part which is subject to desire, it will be the parent of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, fornication, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, and noxious and earthly desires.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>That the rational part of our soul is corrupt.</strong></p>

<p>And therefore if you want to discover the source and origin of this fault, you must recognize that the rational part of your mind and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is corrupt, that part namely from which the faults of presumption and vainglory for the most part spring. Further this first member, so to speak, of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must be healed by the judgment of a right discretion and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of humility, as when it is injured, while you fancy that you can not only still scale the heights of perfection but actually teach others, and hold that you are capable and sufficient to instruct others, through the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of vainglory you are carried away by these vain rovings, which your confession discloses. And these you will then be able to get rid of without difficulty, if you are established as I said in the humility of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> discretion and learn with sorrow of heart how hard and difficult a thing it is for each of us to save his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and admit with the inmost feelings of your heart that you are not only far removed from that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of teaching, but that you are actually still in need of the help of a teacher.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p><strong>How the weaker part of the soul is the first to yield to the devil's temptations.</strong></p>

<p>You should then apply to this member or part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which we have described as particularly wounded, the remedy of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humility: for as, so far as appears, it is weaker than the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in you, it is sure to be the first to yield to the assaults of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. As when some injuries come upon us, which are caused either by toil laid upon us or by a bad atmosphere, it is generally the case in the bodies of men that those which are the weaker are the first to give in and yield to those chances, and when the disease has more particularly laid hold of them, it affects the sound parts of the body also with the same mischief, so also, when the pestilent blast of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> breathes over us the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of each one of us is sure to be tempted above all by that passion, in the case of which its feebler and weaker portion does not make so stubborn a resistance to the powerful attacks of the foe, and to run the risk of being taken captive by those, in the case of which a careless watch opens an easier way to betrayal. For so Balsam  gathered that God's people could be by a sure method deceived, when he advised, that in that quarter, wherein he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were weak, the dangerous snares should be set for them, as he had no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that when a supply of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was offered to them, they would at once fall and be destroyed by fornication, because he was aware that the parts of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which were subject to desire were corrupted. So then the spiritual wickednesses tempt with crafty <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> each one of us, by particularly laying insidious snares for those affections of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in which they have seen that it is weak, as for instance, if they see that the reasonable parts of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are affected, they try to deceive us in the same way that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> tells us that king Ahab was deceived by those Syrians, who said: <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> are merciful: And so let us put sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes round our heads, and go out to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and say to him: Your servant Benhadad says: I pray you, let my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> live.</q> And thereby he was affected by no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> goodness, but by the empty praise of his clemency, and said: <q>If he still lives, he is my brother;</q> and after this fashion they can deceive us also by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of that reasonable part, and make us incur the displeasure of God owing to that from which we were hoping that we might gain a reward and receive the recompense of goodness, and to us too the same rebuke may be addressed: <q>Because you have let go from your hand a man who was worthy of death, your life shall be for his life, and your people for his people</q>  Or when the unclean spirit says: <q>I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352318"><a href="../bible/1ki022.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;22:22</a></span> he certainly spread the nets of deception by means of the reasonable feeling which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be exposed to his deadly wiles. And this also the same spirit expected in the case of our Lord, when he tempted Him in these three affections of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, wherein he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> had been taken captive, but gained nothing by his crafty wiles. For he approached that portion of his mind which was subject to desire, when he said: <q>Command that these stones be made bread;</q> the part subject to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, when he tried to incite Him to seek the power of the present life and the kingdoms of this world; the reasonable part when he said: <q>If You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> cast Yourself down from hence.</q>  And in these his deception availed nothing for this reason because he found that there was nothing damaged in Him, in accordance with the supposition which he had formed from a false idea. Wherefore no part of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> yielded when tempted by the wiles of the foe, <q>For lo,</q> He says, <q>the prince of this world comes and shall find nothing in Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352320"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;14:30</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p><strong>A question whether we should be drawn back to our country by a proper desire for greater silence.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: Among other kinds of illusions and mistakes on our part, which by the vain promise of spiritual advantages have fired us with a longing for our country (as your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has discovered by the keen insight of your mind), this stands out as the principal reason, that sometimes we are beset by our brethren and cannot possibly continue in unbroken solitude and continual silence, as we should like. And by this the course and measure of our daily abstinence, which we always want to maintain undisturbed for the chastening of our body, is sure to be interfered with on the arrival of some of the brethren. And this we certainly feel would never happen in our own country, where it is impossible to find anyone, or scarcely anyone who adopts this manner of life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p><strong>The answer on the devil's illusion, because he promises us the peace of a vaster solitude.</strong></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: Never to be resorted to by men at all is a sign of an unreasonable and ill-considered strictness, or rather of the greatest coldness. For if a man walks in this way, on which he has entered, with too slow steps, and lives according to the former man, it is right that none&mdash; I say not of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>&mdash; but of any men should visit him. But you, if you are inflamed with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of our Lord, and follow <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who indeed is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, with entire fervour of spirit, are sure to be resorted to by men, to whatever inaccessible spot you may flee, and, in proportion as the ardour of divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> brings you nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so will a larger concourse of saintly brethren flock to you. For, as the Lord says, <q>A city set on an hill cannot be hid,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352321"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;5:14</a></span> because <q>them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Me,</q> says the Lord, <q>will I <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and they that despise Me shall be contemned.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352322"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse30">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;2:30</a></span> But you ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is the subtlest device of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, this is his best concealed pitfall, into which he precipitates some wretched and heedless <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, so that, while he is promising them greater things, he takes away the requisite advantages of their daily profit, by persuading them that more remote and raster deserts should be sought, and by portraying them in their heart as if they were sown with marvellous delights. And further some unknown and non-existent spots, he feigns to be well-known and suitable and already given over to our power and able to be secured without any difficulty. The men also of that country he feigns to be docile and followers of the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that, while he is promising richer fruits for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there, he may craftily destroy our present profits. For when owing to this vain hope each one separates himself from living together with the Elders and has been deprived of all those things that he idly imagined in his heart, he rises as it were from a most profound slumber, and when awake will find nothing of those things of which he had dreamed. And so as he is hampered by larger requirements for this life and inextricable snares, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> will not even allow him to aspire to those things which he had once promised himself, and as he is liable no longer to those rare and spiritual visits of the brethren which he had formerly avoided, but to daily interruptions from worldly folk, he will never suffer him to return even to the moderate quiet and system of the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite's</a> life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p><strong>How useful is relaxation on the arrival of brethren.</strong></p>

<p>That most refreshing interlude also of relaxation and courtesy, which sometimes is wont to intervene because of the arrival of brethren, although it may seem to us tiresome and what we ought to avoid, yet how useful it is and good for our bodies as well as our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> you must patiently hear in few words. It often happens I say not to novices and weak <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> but even to those of the greatest experience and perfection, that unless the strain and tension of their mind is lessened by the relaxation of some changes, they fall either into coldness of spirit; or at any rate into a most dangerous state of bodily health. And therefore when there occur even frequent visits from the brethren they should not only be patiently put up with, but even gratefully welcomed by those who are wise and perfect; first because they stimulate us always to desire with greater eagerness the retirement of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> (for somehow while they are thought to impede our progress, they really maintain it unwearied and unbroken, and if it was never hindered by any obstacles, it would not endure to the end with unswerving perseverance), next because they give us the opportunity of refreshing the body, together with the advantages of kindness, and at the same time with a most delightful relaxation of the body confer on us greater advantage than those which we should have gained by the weariness which results from abstinence. On which matter I will briefly give a most apt illustration handed down in an old story.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p><strong>How the Evangelist John is said to have shown the value of relaxation.</strong></p>

<p>It is said that the blessed John, while he was gently stroking a partridge with his hands suddenly saw a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> approaching him in the garb of a hunter, who was astonished that a man of so great fame and <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> should demean himself to such paltry and trivial amusements, and said: <q>Can you be that John, whose great and famous <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> attracted me also with the greatest desire for your acquaintance? Why then do you occupy yourself with such poor amusements?</q> To whom the blessed John: <q>What is it,</q> said he, <q>that you are carrying in your hand?</q> The other replied: <q>a bow.</q> <q>And why,</q> said he, <q>do you not always carry it everywhere bent?</q> To whom the other replied: <q>It would not do, for the force of its stiffness would be relaxed by its being continually bent, and it would be lessened and destroyed, and when the time came for it to send stouter arrows after some beast, its stiffness would be lost by the excessive and continuous strain. and it would be impossible for the more powerful bolts to be shot.</q> <q>And, my lad,</q> said the blessed John, <q>do not let this slight and short relaxation of my mind disturb you, as unless it sometimes relieved and relaxed the rigour of its purpose by some recreation, the spirit would lose its spring owing to the unbroken strain, and would be unable when need required, implicitly to follow what was right.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p><strong>A question how we ought to understand what the gospel says <q>My yoke is easy and My burden is light.</q></strong></p>

<p>Germanus: As you have given us a remedy for all delusions, and by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> all the wiles of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by which we were harassed, have been exposed by your teaching, we beg that you will also explain to us this that is said in the gospel: <q>My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352324"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;11:30</a></span> For it seems tolerably opposed to that saying of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> where it is said: <q>For the sake of the words of Your lips I kept hard ways;</q> while even the Apostle says: <q>All who will live godly in Christ suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>.</q>  But whatever is hard and fraught with <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> cannot be easy and light.</p>

<p><strong>The answer with the explanation of the saying.</strong></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: We can prove by the easy teaching of our own experience that our Lord and Saviour's saying is perfectly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, if we approach the way of perfection properly and in accordance with Christ's will, and mortifying all our desires, and cutting off injurious likings, not only allow nothing to remain with us of this world's goods (whereby our adversary would find at his pleasure opportunities of destroying and damaging us) but actually recognize that we are not our own masters, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> make our own the Apostle's words: <q>I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352326"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> For what can be burdensome, or hard to one who has embraced with his whole heart the yoke of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is established in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humility and ever fixes his eye on the Lord's sufferings and rejoices in all the wrongs that are offered to him, saying: <q>For which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, in distresses, for Christ: for when I am weak, then am I strong</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note352327"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:10</a></span> By what loss of any common thing, I ask, will he be injured, who boasts of perfect renunciation, and voluntarily rejects for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake all the pomp of this world, and considers all and every of its desires as dung, so that he may gain <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and by continual meditation on this command of the gospel, scorns and gets rid of agitation at every loss: <q>For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world, but lose his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p><strong>Why the Lord's yoke is felt grievous and His burden heavy.</strong></p>

<p>But the fact that to us on the contrary the yoke of Christ seems neither light nor easy, must be rightly ascribed to our perverseness, as we are cast down by unbelief and want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and fight with foolish obstinacy against His command, or rather advice, who says: <q>If you will be perfect, go sell (or get rid of) all that you have, and come follow Me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352333"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21</a></span> for we keep the substance of our worldly goods. And as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> holds our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> fast in the toils of these, what remains but that, when he wants to sever us from spiritual delights, he should vex us by diminishing these and depriving us of them, contriving by his crafty wiles that when the sweetness of His yoke and lightness of His burden have become grievous to us through the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of a corrupt desire, and when we are caught in the chains of that very property and substance, which we kept for our comfort and solace, he may always torment us with the scourges of worldly cares, extorting from us ourselves that wherewith we are tortured? For <q>Each one is bound by the cords of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> and hears from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Behold all you that kindle a fire, encompassed with flames, walk in the light of your fire, and in the flames which you have kindled.</q> Since, as Solomon is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, <q>Each man shall thereby be punished, whereby he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q>  For the very pleasures which we enjoy become a torment to us, and the delights and enjoyments of this flesh, turn like executioners upon their originator, because one who is supported by his former <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and property is sure not to admit perfect humility of heart, not entire mortification of dangerous pleasures. But where all these implements of goodness give their aid, there all the trials of this present life, and whatever losses the enemy can contrive, are endured not only with the utmost patience, but with real pleasure, and again when they are wanting so dangerous a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> springs up that we are actually wounded by the deadly strokes of impatience at the slightest reproach, and it may be said to us by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah: <q>And now what have you to do in the way of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to drink the troubled water? And what have you to do with the way of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, to drink the water of the river? Your own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> shall reprove you, and your <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> shall rebuke you. Know and see that it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and a bitter thing for you to have left the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that My <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is not with you, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352335"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse18">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:18-19</a></span> How then is it that the wondrous sweetness of the Lord's yoke is felt to be bitter, but because the bitterness of our dislike injures it? How is it that the exceeding lightness of the Divine burden becomes heavy, but because in our obstinate presumption we despise Him by whom it was borne, especially as Scripture itself plainly testifies to this very thing saying: <q>For if they would walk in right paths, they would certainly have found the paths of righteousness smooth</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note352336"><a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse20">Proverbs&nbsp;2:20</a></span> It is plain, I say, that it is we, who make rough with the nasty and hard stones of our desires the right and smooth paths of the Lord; who most foolishly forsake the royal road made stony with the flints of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and trodden down by the footsteps of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and of the Lord Himself, and seek trackless and thorny places, and, blinded by the allurements of present delights, tear our way with torn legs and our wedding garment rent, through dark paths, overrun with the briars of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so as not only to be pierced by the sharp thorns of the brambles but actually laid low by the bites of deadly serpents and scorpions lurking there. For <q>there are thorns and thistles in wrong ways, but he that fears the Lord shall keep himself from them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352337"><a href="../bible/pro022.htm#verse5">Proverbs&nbsp;22:5</a></span> Of such also the Lord says elsewhere by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>My people have forgotten, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> in vain, and stumbling in their ways, in ancient paths, to walk in them in a way not trodden.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352338"><a href="../bible/jer018.htm#verse15">Jeremiah&nbsp;18:15</a></span> For according to Solomon's saying: <q>The ways of those who do not work are strewn with thorns, but the ways of the lusty are trodden down.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352339"><a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse19">Proverbs&nbsp;15:19</a></span> And thus wandering from the king's highway, they can never arrive at that metropolis, whither our course should ever be directed without swerving. And this also Ecclesiastes has pretty significantly expressed saying: <q>The labour of fools wearies those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to go to the city;</q> viz., that <q>heavenly Jerusalem, which is the mother of us all.</q>  But whoever <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> gives up this world and takes upon him Christ's yoke and learns of Him, and is trained in the daily practice of suffering wrong, for He is <q>meek and lowly of heart,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352341"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;11:29</a></span> will ever remain undisturbed by all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, and <q>all things will work together for good to him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352342"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;8:28</a></span> For as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Obadiah says the words of God are <q>good to him that walks uprightly;</q> and again: <q>For the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them; but the transgressors shall fall in them.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p><strong>Of the good which an attack of temptation brings about.</strong></p>

<p>And so by the struggle with <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> the kindly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Saviour bestows on us larger rewards of praise than if it had taken away from us all need of conflict. For it is a mark of a loftier and grander <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to remain ever unmoved when hemmed in by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> and trials, and to stand faithfully and courageously at the ramparts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the attacks of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, girt as it were with the arms of unconquered <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to triumph <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> over impatience and somehow to gain strength out of weakness, for <q>strength is made perfect in weakness.</q> <q>For behold I have made you.</q> says the Lord, <q>a pillar of iron and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings of Judah, and the princes and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> thereof, and all the people of the land. And they shall fight against you and shall not prevail: for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352344"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse18">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:18-19</a></span> Therefore according to the plain teaching of the Lord the king's highway is easy and smooth, though it may be felt as hard and rough: for those who piously and faithfully serve Him, when they have taken upon them the yoke of the Lord, and have learned of Him, that He is meek and lowly of heart, at once somehow or other lay aside the burden of earthly <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and find no labour but rest for their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, by the gift of the Lord, as He Himself testifies by <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, saying: <q>Stand on the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, which is the good way, and walk in it: and you shall find refreshment for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q> For to them at once <q>the crooked shall become straight and the rough ways plain;</q> and they shall <q>taste and see that the Lord is gracious,</q>  and when they hear Christ proclaiming in the gospel: <q>Come unto Me all you that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you,</q> they will lay aside the burden of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and realize what follows: <q>For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352346"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;11:28-30</a></span> The way of the Lord then has refreshment if it is kept to according to His law. But it is we who by troublesome distractions bring sorrows and troubles upon ourselves, while we try even with the utmost exertion and difficulty to follow the crooked and perverse ways of this world. But when in this way we have made the Lord's yoke heavy and hard to us, we at once complain in a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> spirit of the hardness and roughness of the yoke itself or of Christ who lays it upon us, in accordance with this passage: <q>The folly of man corrupts his ways, but he blames God in his heart;</q>  and as Haggai the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, when we say that <q>the way of the Lord is not right</q> the reply is aptly made to us by the Lord: <q>Is not My way right? Are not your ways rather crooked?</q>  And indeed if you will compare the sweet scented flower of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and tender purity of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> to the foul and fetid sloughs of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, the calm and security of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to the dangers and losses in which the men of this world are involved, the peace of our poverty to the gnawing vexations and anxious cares of riches, in which they are night and day consumed not without the utmost peril to life, then you will prove that the yoke of Christ is most easy and His burden most light.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p><strong>How the promise of an hundredfold in this life is made to those whose renunciation is perfect.</strong></p>

<p>Further also that recompense of reward, wherein the Lord promises an hundredfold in this life to those whose renunciation is perfect, and says: <q>And everyone that has left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for My name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold in the present time and shall inherit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352349"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;19:29</a></span> is rightly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> taken in the same sense without any disturbance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For many taking occasion by this saying, insist with crass intelligence that these things will be given carnally in the millennium, though they must certainly admit that age, which they say will be after the resurrection cannot possibly be understood as present. It is then more credible and much clearer that one, who at the persuasion of Christ has made light of any worldly affections or goods, receives from the brethren and partners of his life, who are joined to him by a spiritual tie, even in this life a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is an hundred times better: since it is certain that among <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and children and brothers, wives and relations, where either the tie is merely formed by intercourse, or the bond of union by the claims of relationship, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is tolerably short lived and easily broken. Finally even good and duteous children when they have grown up, are sometimes shut out by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> from their homes and property, and sometimes for a really good reason the tie of matrimony is severed, and a quarrelsome division destroys the property of brothers. Monks alone maintain a lasting union in intimacy, and possess all things in common, as they hold that everything that belongs to their brethren is their own, and that everything which is their own is their brethren's. If then the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is compared to those affections where the bond of union is a carnal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, certainly it is an hundred times sweeter and finer. There will indeed also be gained from conjugal continence a pleasure that is an hundred times greater than that which arises from the union of the sexes. And instead of that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, which a man experiences from the possession of a single field of house, he will enjoy a delight in riches a hundred times greater, if he passes over to the adoption of sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and possesses as his own all things which belong to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Father, and asserts in heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after the fashion of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son: <q>All things that the Father has are mine;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352350"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;16:15</a></span> and if no longer tried by that criminal anxiety in distractions and cares, but free from care and glad at heart he succeeds everywhere to his own, hearing daily the announcement made to him by the Apostle: <q>For all things are yours, whether the world, or things present, or things to come;</q> and by Solomon: <q>The faithful man has a whole world of riches.</q>  You have then that recompense of an hundredfold brought out by the greatness of the value, and the difference of the character that cannot be estimated. For if for a fixed weight of brass or iron or some still commoner metal, one had given in exchange the same weight only in gold, he would appear to have given much more than an hundredfold. And so when for the scorn of delights and earthly affections there is made a recompense of spiritual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> of a most precious <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, even if the actual amount be the same, yet it is an hundred times better and grander. And to make this plainer by frequent repetition: I used formerly to have a wife in the lustful passion of desire: I now have one in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> sanctification and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is but one, but the value of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has increased an hundredfold. But if instead of distrusting <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> you have regard to constant gentleness and patience, instead of the stress of anxiety and trouble, peace and freedom from care, instead of the fruitless and criminal vexation of this world the salutary fruits of sorrow, instead of the vanity of temporal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> the richness of spiritual delights, you will see in the change of these feelings a recompense of an hundredfold. And if we compare with the short-lived and fleeting pleasure of each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the benefits of the opposite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> the increased delights will prove that these are an hundred times better. For in counting on your fingers you transfer the number of an hundred from the left hand to the right and though you seem to keep the same arrangement of the fingers yet there is a great increase in the amount of the quantity.  For the result will be that we who seemed to bear the form of the goats on the left hand, will be removed and gain the reward of the sheep on the right hand. Now let us pass on to consider the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of those things which Christ gives back to us in this world for our scorn of worldly advantages, more particularly according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Mark who says: <q>There is no man who has left house or brethren or sisters or mother or children or lands for My sake and the gospel's sake, who shall not receive an hundred times as much now in this time: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, and in the world to come life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352353"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse29">Mark&nbsp;10:29-30</a></span> For he who for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name disregards the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of a single father or mother or child, and gives himself over to the purest <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of all who serve Christ, will receive an hundred times the amount of brethren and kinsfolk; since instead of but one he will begin to have so many fathers and brethren bound to him by a still more fervent and admirable affection. He also will be enriched with an increased possession of lands, who has given up a single house for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and possesses countless homes in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> as his own, to whatever part of the world he may retire, as to his own house. For how can he fail to receive an hundredfold, and, if it is not wrong to add somewhat to our Lord's words, more than an hundredfold, who gives up the faithless and compulsory service of ten or twenty slaves and relies on the spontaneous attendance of so many noble and free born men? And that this is so you could prove by your own experience, as since you have each left but one father and mother and home, you have gained without any effort or care, in any part of the world to which you have come, countless fathers and mothers and brethren, as well as houses and lands and most faithful servants, who receive you as their masters, and welcome, and respect, and take care of you with the utmost attention. But, I say that deservedly and confidently will the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> enjoy this service, if they have first submitted themselves and everything they have by a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> offering for the service of the brethren. For, as the Lord says, they will freely receive back that which they themselves have bestowed on others. But if a man has not first offered this with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humility to his companions, how can he calmly endure to have it offered to him by others, when he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he is burdened rather than helped by their services, because he prefers to receive attention from the brethren rather than to give it to them?</p>

<p>But all these things he will receive not with careless slackness and a lazy delight, but, in accordance with the Lord's word, <q>with <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>,</q> i.e., with the pressure of this world, and terrible distress from his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, because, as the wise man testifies: <q>He who is easy going and without trouble shall come to want.</q>  For not the <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a>, or the careless, or the delicate, or the tender take the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> by force, but the violent. Who then are the violent? Surely they are those who show a splendid <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> not to others, but to their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, who by a laudable force deprive it of all delights in things present, and are declared by the Lord's mouth to be splendid plunderers, and by rapine of this kind, violently seize upon the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. For, as the Lord says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> suffers <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and the violent take it by force.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352355"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;11:12</a></span> Those are certainly worthy of praise as violent, who do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to their own destruction, for, <q>A man,</q> as it is written, <q>that is in sorrow labours for himself and does <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to his own destruction.</q>  For our destruction is delight in this present life, and to speak more definitely, the performance of our own likes and desires, as, if a man withdraws these from his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and mortifies them, he straightway does <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and valuable <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to his own destruction, provided that he refuses to it the pleasantest of its wishes which the Divine word often rebukes by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying: <q>For in the days of your fast your own will is found;</q> and again: <q>If you turn away your foot from the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, to do your will on My <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day, and glorify him, while thou dost not your own ways, and your own will is not found, to speak a word.</q> And the great blessedness that is promised to him is at once added by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. <q>Then,</q> he says, <q>shall you be delighted in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and I will lift you up above the high places of the earth, and will feed you with the inheritance of Jacob your father. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.</q>  And therefore our Lord and Saviour, to give us an example of giving up our own wills, says: <q>I came not to do My own will, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent Me;</q> and again: <q>Not as I will, but as You will.</q>  And this good quality those men in particular show who live in the C&oelig;nobia and are governed by the rule of the Elders, who do nothing of their own choice, but their will depends upon the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Abbot. Finally to bring this discussion to a close, I ask you, do not those who faithfully serve Christ, most clearly receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> an hundredfold in this, while for His name's sake they are honoured by the greatest princes, and though they do not look for the praise of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, yet become venerated in the trials of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> whose <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> condition would perhaps have been looked down upon even by common folk, either because of their obscure birth, or because of their condition as slaves, if they had continued in their life in the world? But because of the service of Christ no one will venture to raise a <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> against their state of nobility, or to fling in their teeth the obscurity of their origin. Nay rather, through the very opprobrium of a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> condition by which others are shamed and confounded, the servants of Christ are more splendidly ennobled, as we can clearly show by the case of Abbot John who lives in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> which borders on the town of Lycus. For he sprang from obscure <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, but owing to the name of Christ has become so well known to almost all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> that the very lords of creation, who hold the reins of this world and of empire, and are a terror to all powers and kings, venerate him as their lord, and from distant countries seek his advice, and entrust to his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and merits the crown of their empire, and the state of safety, and the fortunes of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. </p>

<p>In such terms the blessed <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> discoursed on the origin of and remedy for our illusion, and exposed to our eyes the crafty thoughts which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had originated and suggested, and kindled in us the desire of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> mortification, wherewith we hope that many also may be inflamed, even though all these things have been written in a somewhat simple style. For though the dying embers of our words cover up the glowing thoughts of the greatest fathers, yet we hope that in the case of very many who try to remove the embers of our words and to fan into a flame the hidden thoughts, their coldness will be turned into heat. But, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren, I have not indeed been so puffed up by the spirit of presumption as to give forth to you this fire (which the Lord came to send upon the earth, and which He eagerly longs to kindle <span class="stiki" id="note352360"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span>) in order that by the application of this warmth I might set on fire your purpose which is already at a white heat, but in order that your authority with your children might be greater, if in addition the precepts of the greatest and most ancient fathers support what you are teaching not by the dead sound of words but by your living example. It only remains that I who have been till now tossed about by a most dangerous tempest, should be wafted to the safe harbour of silence by the spiritual gales of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.</p>
