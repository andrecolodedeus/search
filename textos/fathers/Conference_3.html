<h1>Conference 3</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>CONFERENCE OF ABBOT PAPHNUTIUS. ON THE THREE SORTS OF RENUNCIATIONS.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>Of the life and conduct of Abbot Paphnutius.</strong></p>

<p>In that <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who shine like brilliant stars in the night of this world, we have seen the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Paphnutius,  like some great luminary, shining with the brightness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of our company, I mean of those whose abode was in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Scete, where he lived to extreme old age, without ever moving from his cell, of which he had taken possession when still young, and which was five miles from the church, even to nearer districts; nor was he when worn out with years hindered by the distance from going to Church on Saturday or Sunday. But not wanting to return from thence empty handed he would lay on his shoulders a bucket of water to last him all the week, and carry it back to his cell, and even when he was past ninety would not suffer it to be fetched by the labour of younger men. He then from his earliest youth threw himself into the monastic discipline with such fervour that when he had spent only a short time in it, he was endowed with the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of submission, as well as the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all good qualities. For by the practice of humility and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> he mortified all his desires, and by this stamped out all his faults and acquired every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which the monastic system and the teaching of the ancient fathers produces, and, inflamed with desire for still further advances, he was eager to penetrate into the recesses of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, so that, with no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> companions to disturb him, he might be more readily united to the Lord, to whom he longed to be inseparably joined, even while he still lived in the society of the brethren. And there once more in his excessive fervour he outstripped the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the Anchorites, and in his eager desire for continual divine meditation avoided the sight of them: and he plunged into solitary places yet wilder and more inaccessible, and hid himself for a long while in them, so that, as the Anchorites themselves only with great difficulty caught a glimpse of him every now and then, the belief was that he enjoyed and delighted in the daily society of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and because of this remarkable characteristic of his  he was surnamed by them the Buffalo.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>Of the discourse of the same old man, and our reply to it.</strong></p>

<p>As then we were anxious to learn from his teaching, we came in some agitation to his cell towards evening. And after a short silence he began to commend our undertaking, because we had left our homes, and had visited so many countries out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the Lord, and were endeavouring with all our might to endure want and the trials of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and to imitate their severe life, which even those who had been born and bred in the same state of want and penury, could scarcely put up with; and we replied that we had come for his teaching and instruction in order that we might be to some extent initiated in the customs of so great a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and in that perfection which we had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from many evidences to exist in him, not that we might be honoured by any commendations to which we had no right, or be puffed up with any elation of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, (with which we were sometimes exercised in our own cells at the suggestion of our enemy) in consequence of any words of his. Wherefore we begged him rather to lay before us what would make us <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and contrite, and not what would flatter us and puff us up.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>The statement of Abbot Paphnutius on the three kinds of vocations, and the three sorts of renunciations.</strong></p>

<p>Then The Blessed Paphnutius: There are, said he, three kinds of vocations. And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there are three sorts of renunciations as well, which are necessary to a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, whatever his vocation may be. And we ought diligently to examine first the reason for which we said that there were three kinds of vocations, that when we are sure that we are summoned to God's service in the first stage of our vocation, we may take care that our life is in harmony with the exalted height to which we are called, for it will be of no use to have made a good beginning if we do not show forth an end corresponding to it. But if we feel that only in the last resort have we been dragged away from a worldly life, then, as it appears that we rest on a less satisfactory beginning as regards religion, so must we proportionately make the more earnest endeavours to rouse ourselves with spiritual fervour to make a better end. It is well too on every ground for us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> secondly the manner of the threefold renunciations because we shall never be able to attain perfection, if we are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it or if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, but do not attempt to carry it out in act.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>An explanation of the three callings.</strong></p>

<p>To make clear therefore the main differences between these three kinds of calling, the first is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the second comes through man, the third is from compulsion. And a calling is from God whenever some inspiration has taken possession of our heart, and even while we are asleep stirs in us at desire for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and bids us follow God and cleave to His commandments with life-giving contrition: as we read in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was called by the voice of the Lord from his native country, and all his dear relations, and his father's house; when the Lord said <q>Get you out from your country and from your kinsfolk and from your father's house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351201"><a href="../bible/gen012.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;12:1</a></span> And in this way we have heard that the blessed Antony also was called,  the occasion of whose conversion was received from God alone. For on entering a church he there heard in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the Lord saying: <q>Whoever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> not father and mother and children and wife and lands, yea and his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also, cannot be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>;</q> and <q>if you will be perfect, go sell all that you have, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and you shall have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me:</q>  And with heartfelt contrition he took this charge of the Lord as if specially aimed at him, and at once gave up everything and followed Christ, without any incitement thereto from the advice and teaching of men. The second kind of calling is that which we said took place through man; viz., when we are stirred up by the example of some of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and their advice, and thus inflamed with the desire of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: and by this we never forget that by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord we ourselves were summoned, as we were aroused by the advice and good example of the above-mentioned saint, to give ourselves up to this aim and calling; and in this way also we find in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> that it was through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were delivered from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> bondage. But the third kind of calling is that which comes from compulsion, when we have been involved in the riches and pleasures of this life, and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> suddenly come upon us and either threaten us with peril of death, or smite us with the loss and confiscation of our goods, or strike us down with the death of those dear to us, and thus at length even against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> we are driven to turn to God whom we scorned to follow in the days of our <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. And of this compulsory call we often find instances in Scripture, when we read that on account of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were given up by the Lord to their enemies; and that on account of their tyranny and savage cruelty they turned again, and cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. And it says: <q>The Lord sent them a Saviour, called Ehud, the son of Gera, the son of Jemini, who used the left hand as well as the right:</q> and again we are told, <q>they cried unto the Lord, who raised them up a Saviour and delivered them, to wit, Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</q>  And it is of such that the Psalm speaks: <q>When He slew them, then they sought Him: and they returned and came to Him early in the morning: and they remembered that God was their helper, and the most High God their redeemer.</q> And again: <q>And they cried unto the Lord when they were troubled, and He delivered them out of their distress.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>How the first of these calls is of no use to a sluggard, and the last is no hindrance to one who is in earnest.</strong></p>

<p>Of these three calls then, although the two former may seem to rest on better principles, yet sometimes we find that even by the third grade, which seems the lowest and the coldest, men have been made perfect and most earnest in spirit, and have become like those who made an admirable beginning in approaching the Lord's service, and passed the rest of their lives also in most laudable fervour of spirit: and again we find that from the higher grade very many have grown cold, and often have come to a miserable end. And just as it was no hindrance to the former class that they seemed to be converted not of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, but by force and compulsion, in as much as the loving kindness of the Lord secured for them the opportunity for repentance, so too to the latter it was of no avail that the early days of their conversion were so bright, because they were not careful to bring the remainder of their life to a suitable end. For in the case of Abbot <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,  who lived in a spot in the wilderness called Calamus,  nothing was wanting to his merits and perfect bliss, in consequence of the fact that he was driven to flee to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, which was hanging over him because of a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>; for he made such use of his compulsory conversion that with ready <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he turned it into a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> one and climbed the topmost heights of perfection. As also on the other hand; to very many, whose names I ought not to mention, it has been of no avail that they entered on the Lord's service with better beginning than this, as afterwards sloth and hardness of heart crept over them, and they fell into a dangerous state of torpor, and the bottomless pit of death, an instance of which we see clearly indicated in the call of the Apostles. For of what good was it to Judas that he had of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> embraced the highest grade of the Apostolate in the same way in which Peter and the rest of the Apostles had been summoned, as he allowed the splendid beginning of his call to terminate in a ruinous end of cupidity and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and as a cruel murderer even rushed into the betrayal of the Lord? Or what hindrance was it to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> that he was suddenly blinded, and seemed to be drawn against his will into the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as afterwards he followed the Lord with complete fervour of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and having begun by compulsion completed it by a free and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> devotion, and terminated with a magnificent end a life that was rendered <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> by such great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>? Everything therefore depends upon the end; in which one who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a noble conversion at the outset may through carelessness turn out a failure, and one who was compelled by necessity to adopt the monastic life may through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and earnestness be made perfect.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>An account of the three sorts of renunciations.</strong></p>

<p>We must now speak of the renunciations, of which tradition and the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> show us three, and which every one of us ought with the utmost <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to make complete. The first is that by which as far as the body is concerned we make light of all the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and goods of this world; the second, that by which we reject the fashions and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and former affections of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh; the third, that by which we detach our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from all present and visible things, and contemplate only things to come, and set our heart on what is invisible. And we read that the Lord charged <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to do all these three at once, when He said to him <q>Get you out from your country, and your kinsfolk, and your father's house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351208"><a href="../bible/gen012.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;12:1</a></span> First He said <q>from your country,</q> i.e., from the goods of this world, and earthly riches: secondly, <q>from your kinsfolk,</q> i.e., from this former life and habits and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which cling to us from our very birth and are joined to us as it were by ties of affinity and kinship: thirdly, <q>from your father's house,</q> i.e., from all the recollection of this world, which the sight of the eyes can afford. For of the two fathers, i.e., of the one who is to be forsaken, and of the one who is to be sought, David thus speaks in the person of God: <q>Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear: forget also your own people and your father's house:</q>  for the person who says <q>Hearken, O daughter,</q> is certainly a Father; and yet he bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that the one, whose house and people he urges should be forgotten, is none the less father of his daughter. And this happens when being dead with Christ to the rudiments of this world, we no longer, as the Apostle says, regard <q>the things which are seen, but those which are not seen, for the things which are not seen are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351210"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:18</a></span> and going forth in heart from this temporal and visible home, turn our eyes and heart towards that in which we are to remain for ever. And this we shall succeed in doing when, while we walk in the flesh, we are no longer at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Lord according to the flesh, proclaiming in deed and actions the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of that saying of the blessed Apostle <q>Our conversation is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351211"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;3:20</a></span> To these three sorts of renunciations the three books of Solomon suitably correspond. For Proverbs answers to the first renunciation, as in it the desires for carnal things and earthly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are repressed; to the second Ecclesiastes corresponds, as there everything which is done under the sun is declared to be vanity; to the third the Song of Songs, in which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> soaring above all things visible, is actually joined to the word of God by the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of heavenly things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>How we can attain perfection in each of these sorts of renunciations.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore it will not be of much advantage to us that we have made our first renunciation with the utmost devotion and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if we do not complete the second with the same <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and ardour. And so when we have succeeded in this, we shall be able to arrive at the third as well, in which we go forth from the house of our former parent, (who, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well, was our father from our very birth, after the old man, when we were <q>by nature children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, as others also,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351212"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;2:3</a></span>) and fix our whole mental gaze on things celestial.

Wherefore we should be careful to take examples of goodness from those who are few and far between, because according to that figure of which we have spoken in the gospel <q>Many are called but few</q> are said to be <q>chosen.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351223"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;22:14</a></span> A renunciation then in body alone, and a mere change of place from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> will not do us any good, if we do not succeed in achieving that renunciation in heart, which is far higher and more valuable. For of that mere bodily renunciation of which we have spoken the apostle declares as follows: <q>Though I bestow all my goods to feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and give my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profits me nothing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351224"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> And the blessed Apostle would never have said this had it not been that he foresaw by the spirit that some who had given all their goods to feed the poor would not be able to attain to evangelical perfection and the lofty heights of charity, because while <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or impatience ruled over their hearts they were not careful to purify themselves from their former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and unrestrained habits, and on that account could never attain to that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God which never fails, and these, as they fall short in this second stage of renunciation, can still less reach that third stage which is most certainly far higher. But consider too in your minds with great care the fact that he did not simply say <q>If I bestow my goods.</q> For it might perhaps be thought that he spoke of one who had not fulfilled the command of the gospel, but had kept back something for himself, as some half-hearted <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> do. But he says <q>Though I bestow all my goods to feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>,</q> i.e., even if my renunciation of those earthly riches be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>. And to this renunciation he adds something still greater: <q>And though I give my body to be burned, but have not charity, I am nothing:</q> As if he had said in other words, though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor in accordance with that command in the gospel, where we are told <q>If you will be perfect, go sell all that you have, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and you shall have treasure in heaven,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351225"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21</a></span> renouncing them so as to keep back nothing at all for myself, and though to this distribution (of my goods) I should by the burning of my flesh add <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> so as to give up my body for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and yet be impatient, or passionate or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> or <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, or excited by wrongs done by others, or seek what is mine, or indulge in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts, or not be ready and patient in bearing all that can be inflicted on me, this renunciation and the burning of the outer man will profit me nothing, while the inner man is still involved in the former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because, while in the fervour of the early days of my conversion I made light of the mere worldly substance, which is said to be not good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself but indifferent, I took no care to cast out in like manner the injurious powers of a bad heart, or to attain to that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Lord which is patient, which is <q>kind, which envies not, is not puffed up, is not soon <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, deals not perversely, seeks not her own, thinks no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> which <q>bears all things, endures all things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351226"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:4-7</a></span> and which lastly never suffers him who follows after it to fall by the deceitfulness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>Of our very own possessions in which the beauty of the soul is seen or its foulness.</strong></p>

<p>We ought then to take the utmost care that our inner man as well may cast off and make away with all those possessions of its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which it acquired in its former life: which as they continually cling to body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are our very own, and, unless we reject them and cut them off while we are still in the flesh, will not cease to accompany us after death. For as good qualities, or charity itself which is their source, may be gained in this world, and after the close of this life make the man who loves it lovely and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, so our faults transmit to that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> remembrance a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> darkened and stained with foul colours. For the beauty or ugliness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the product of its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> or its <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, the colour it takes from which either makes it so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, that it may well hear from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <q>And the king shall have pleasure in your beauty,</q>  or so black, and foul, and ugly, that it must surely acknowledge the stench of its shame, and say <q>My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness,</q>  and the Lord Himself says to it <q>Why is not the wound of the daughter of my people closed?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351229"><a href="../bible/jer008.htm#verse22">Jeremiah&nbsp;8:22</a></span> And therefore these are our very own possessions, which continually remain with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which no king and no enemy can either give or take away from us. These are our very own possessions which not even death itself can part from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but by renouncing which we can attain to perfection, and by clinging to which we shall suffer the punishment of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>Of three sorts of possessions.</strong></p>

<p>Riches and possessions are taken in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> in three different ways, i.e., as good, bad, and indifferent. Those are bad, of which it is said: <q>The rich have wanted and have suffered hunger,</q>  and <q>Woe unto you that are rich, for you have received your consolation:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351231"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse24">Luke&nbsp;6:24</a></span> and to have cast off these riches is the height of perfection; and a distinction which belongs to those poor who are commended in the gospel by the Lord's saying: <q>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351232"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;5:3</a></span> and in the Psalm: <q>This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him,</q>  and again: <q>The poor and needy shall praise your name.</q>  Those riches are good, to acquire which is the work of great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and merit, and the righteous possessor of which is praised by David who says <q>The generation of the righteous shall be blessed: <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and riches are in his house, and his righteousness remains for ever:</q>  and again <q>the ransom of a man's life are his riches.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351236"><a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse8">Proverbs&nbsp;13:8</a></span> And of these riches it is said in the Apocalypse to him who has them not and to his shame is poor and naked: <q>I will begin,</q> says he, <q>to vomit you out of my mouth. Because you say I am rich and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and have need of nothing: and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> not that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked, I counsel you to buy of me gold fire-tried, that you may be made rich, and may be clothed in white garments, and that the shame of your nakedness may not appear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351237"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse16">Revelation&nbsp;3:16-18</a></span> There are some also which are indifferent, i.e., which may be made either good or bad: for they are made either one or the other in accordance with the will and character of those who use them: of which the blessed, Apostle says <q>Charge the rich of this world not to be high-minded nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in God (who gives us abundantly all things to enjoy), to do good, to give easily, to communicate to others, to lay up in store for themselves a good foundation that they may lay hold on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351238"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:17-19</a></span> These are what the rich man in the gospel kept, and never distributed to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>&mdash;while the beggar Lazarus was lying at his gate and desiring to be fed with his crumbs; and so he was condemned to the unbearable flames and everlasting heat of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>That none can become perfect merely through the first grade of renunciation.</strong></p>

<p>In leaving then these visible goods of the world we forsake not our own <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, but that which is not ours, although we boast of it as either gained by our own exertions or inherited by us from our forefathers. For as I said nothing is our own, save this only which we possess with our heart, and which cleaves to our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and therefore cannot be taken away from us by any one. But Christ speaks in terms of censure of those visible riches, to those who clutch them as if they were their own, and refuse to share them with those in want. <q>If you have not been faithful in what is another's, who will give to you what is your own?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351240"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;16:12</a></span> Plainly then it is not only daily experience which teaches us that these riches are not our own, but this saying of our Lord also, by the very title which it gives them. But concerning visible  and worthless riches Peter says to the Lord: <q>Lo, we have left all and followed you. What shall we have therefore?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351242"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;19:27</a></span> when it is clear that they had left nothing but their miserable broken nets. And unless this expression <q>all</q> is understood to refer to that renunciation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which is really great and important, we shall not find that the Apostles had left anything of any value, or that the Lord had any reason for bestowing on them the blessing of so great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that they were allowed to hear from Him that <q>in the regeneration, when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall sit on the throne of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  If then those, who have completely renounced their earthly and visible goods, cannot for sufficient reason attain to Apostolic charity, nor climb with readiness and vigour to that third stage of renunciation which is still higher and belongs to but few, what should those think of themselves, who do not even make that first step (which is very easy) a thorough one, but keep together with their old want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, their former sordid riches, and fancy that they can boast of the mere name of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>? The first renunciation then of which we spoke is of what is not our own, and therefore is not enough of itself to confer perfection on the renunciant, unless he advances to the second, which is really and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a renunciation of what belongs to us. And when we have made sure of this by the expulsion of all our faults, we shall mount to the heights of the third renunciation also, whereby we rise above not merely all those things which are done in this world or specially belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but even that whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> around us which is esteemed so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and shall with heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> look down upon it as subject to vanity and destined soon to pass away; as we look, as the Apostle says, <q>not on those things which are seen, but on those which are not seen: for the things that are seen, are temporal, and the things which are not seen are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351244"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:18</a></span> that so we may be found worthy to hear that highest utterance, which was spoken to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: <q>and come into a land which I will show you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351245"><a href="../bible/gen012.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;12:1</a></span> which clearly shows that unless a man has made those three former renunciations with all earnestness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he cannot attain to this fourth, which is granted as a reward and privilege to one whose renunciation is perfect, that he may be found worthy to enter the land of promise which no longer bears for him the thorns and thistles of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; which after all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> have been driven out is acquired by purity of heart even in the body, and which no good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> or exertions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> efforts (can gain), but which the Lord Himself promises to show, saying <q>And come into the land which I will show to you:</q> which clearly proves that the beginning of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> results from the call of the Lord, Who says <q>Get you out from your country,</q> and that the completion of perfection and purity is His gift in the same way, as He says <q>And come into the land which I will show you,</q> i.e., not one you yourself can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or discover by your own efforts, but one which I will show not only to one who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it, but even to one who is not looking for it. And from this we clearly gather that as we hasten to the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through being stirred up by the inspiration of the Lord, so too it is under the guidance of His direction and illumination that we attain to the perfection of the highest bliss.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>A question on the free will of man and the grace of God.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: Where then is there room for <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and how is it ascribed to our efforts that we are worthy of praise, if God both begins and ends everything in us which concerns our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>The answer on the economy of Divine Grace, with free will still remaining in us.</strong></p>

<p>Paphnutius: This would fairly influence us, if in every work and practice, the beginning and the end were everything, and there were no middle in between. And so as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God creates opportunities of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in various ways, it is in our power to make use of the opportunities granted to us by heaven more or less earnestly. For just as the offer came from God Who called him <q>get you out of your country,</q> so the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> was on the part of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> who went forth; and as the fact that the saying <q>Come into the land</q> was carried into action, was the work of him who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, so the addition of the words <q>which I will show you</q> came from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God Who commanded or promised it. But it is well for us to be sure that although we practise every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with unceasing efforts, yet with all our exertions and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> we can never arrive at perfection, nor is mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> diligence and toil of itself sufficient to deserve to reach the splendid reward of bliss, unless we have secured it by means of the co-operation of the Lord, and His directing our heart to what is right. And so we ought every moment to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and say with David <q>Order my steps in your paths that my footsteps slip not:</q>  and <q>He has set my feet upon a rock and ordered my goings:</q>  that He Who is the unseen ruler of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart may vouchsafe to turn to the desire of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that will of ours, which is more readily inclined to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> either through want of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or through the delights of passion. And we read this in a verse in which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> sings very plainly: <q>Being pushed I was overturned that I might fall,</q> where the weakness of our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is shown. And <q>the Lord sustained me:</q>  again this shows that the Lord's help is always joined to it, and by this, that we may not be altogether destroyed by our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, when He sees that we have stumbled, He sustains and supports us, as it were by stretching out His hand. And again: <q>If I said my foot was moved;</q> viz., from the slippery character of the will, <q>Your mercy, O Lord, helped me.</q>  Once more he joins on the help of God to his own weakness, as he confesses that it was not owing to his own efforts but to the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the foot of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was not moved. And again: <q>According to the multitude of the sorrows which I had in my heart,</q> which sprang most certainly from my <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, <q>Your comforts have refreshed my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,</q>  i.e., by coming through Your inspiration into my heart, and laying open the view of future blessings which You have prepared for them who labour in Your name, they not only removed all anxiety from my heart, but actually conferred upon it the greatest delight. And again: <q>Had it not been that the Lord helped me, my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had almost dwelt in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q>  He certainly shows that through the depravity of this <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> he would have dwelt in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, had he not been saved by the assistance and protection of the Lord. For <q>By the Lord,</q> and not by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, <q>are a man's steps directed,</q> and <q>although the righteous fall</q> at least by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, <q>he shall not be cast away.</q> And why? Because <q>the Lord upholds him with His hand:</q>  and this is to say with the utmost clearness: None of the righteous are sufficient of themselves to acquire righteousness, unless every moment when they stumble and fall the Divine mercy supports them with His hands, that they may not utterly collapse and perish, when they have been cast down through the weakness of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><strong>That the ordering of our way comes from God.</strong></p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have never said that it was by their own efforts that they secured the direction of the way in which they walked in their course towards advance and perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but rather they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for it from the Lord, saying <q>Direct me in Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> and <q>direct my way in your sight.</q>  But someone else declares that he discovered this very fact not only by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but also by experience, and as it were from the very nature of things: <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O Lord, that the way of man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk and to direct his steps.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351254"><a href="../bible/jer010.htm#verse23">Jeremiah&nbsp;10:23</a></span> And the Lord Himself says to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: <q>I will direct him like a green fir-tree: from Me is your fruit found.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351255"><a href="../bible/hos014.htm#verse9">Hosea&nbsp;14:9</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>That knowledge of the law is given by the guidance and illumination of the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> also of the law itself they daily endeavour to gain not by diligence in reading, but by the guidance and illumination of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as they say to Him: <q>Show me Your ways, O Lord, and teach me Your paths:</q> and <q>open my eyes: and I shall see the wondrous things of Your law:</q> and <q>teach me to do Your will, for You are my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and again: <q>Who teaches man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>That the understanding, by means of which we can recognize God's commands, and the performance of a good will are both gifts from the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>Further the blessed David asks of the Lord that he may gain that very understanding, by which he can recognize God's commands  which, he well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, were written in the book of the law, and he says <q>I am Your servant: O give me understanding that I may learn Your commandments.</q>  Certainly he was in possession of understanding, which had been granted to him by nature, and also had at his fingers' ends a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God's commands which were preserved in writing in the law: and still he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> the Lord that he might learn this more thoroughly as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that what came to him by nature would never be sufficient for him, unless his understanding was enlightened by the Lord by a daily illumination from Him, to understand the law spiritually and to recognize His commands more clearly, as the <q>chosen vessel</q> also declares very plainly this which we are insisting on. <q>For it is God which works in you both to will and to do according to good will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351258"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> What could well be clearer than the assertion that both our good will and the completion of our work are fully wrought in us by the Lord?

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>That faith itself must be given us by the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>But so thoroughly did the Apostles realize that everything which concerns <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was given them by the Lord, that they even asked that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself should be granted from the Lord, saying: <q>Add to us <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note351266"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;17:5</a></span> as they did not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that it could be gained by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that it would be bestowed by the free gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Lastly the Author of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> teaches us how feeble and weak and insufficient our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would be unless it were strengthened by the aid of the Lord, when He says to Peter <q>Simon, Simon, behold <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat. But I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to my Father that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351267"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;22:31-32</a></span> And another finding that this was happening in his own case, and seeing that his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was being driven by the waves of unbelief on the rocks which would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a fearful shipwreck, asks of the same Lord an aid to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, saying <q>Lord, help mine unbelief.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351268"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse23">Mark&nbsp;9:23</a></span> So thoroughly then did those Apostles and men in the gospel realize that everything which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is brought to perfection by the aid of the Lord, and not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they could preserve their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unharmed by their own strength or <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> that they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that it might be helped or granted to them by the Lord. And if in Peter's case there was need of the Lord's help that it might not fail, who will be so presumptuous and blind as to fancy that he has no need of daily assistance from the Lord in order to preserve it? Especially as the Lord Himself has made this clear in the gospel, saying: <q>As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine, so no more can you, unless you abide in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351269"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;15:4</a></span> And again: <q>for without me you can do nothing.</q>  How foolish and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> then it is to attribute any good action to our own diligence and not to God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and assistance, is clearly shown by the Lord's saying, which lays down that no one can show forth the fruits of the Spirit without His inspiration and co-operation. For <q>every good gift and every perfect boon is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351271"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse17">James&nbsp;1:17</a></span> And Zechariah too says, <q>For whatever is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is His, and what is excellent is from Him.</q>  And so the blessed Apostle consistently says: <q>What do you have which you did not receive?

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p><strong>That temperateness and the endurance of temptations must be given to us by the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>And that all the endurance, with which we can bear the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> brought upon us, depends not so much on our own strength as on the mercy and guidance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the blessed Apostle thus declares: <q>No <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> has come upon you but such as is common to man. But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able, but will with the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> make also a way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351274"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:13</a></span> And that God fits and strengthens our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for every good work, and works in us all those things which are pleasing to Him, the same Apostle teaches: <q>May the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace who brought out of darkness the great Shepherd of the sheep, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, in the blood of the everlasting Testament, fit you in all goodness, working in you what is well-pleasing in His sight.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351275"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse20">Hebrews&nbsp;13:20-21</a></span> And that the same thing may happen to the Thessalonians he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> as follows, saying: <q>Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself and God our Father who has loved us and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, exhort your hearts, and confirm you in every good word and work.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351276"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:15-16</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p><strong>That the continual fear of God must be bestowed on us by the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>And lastly the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah, speaking in the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, clearly testifies that even the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which we can hold fast to Him, is shed upon us by the Lord: saying as follows: <q>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Me all days: and that it may be well with them and with their children after them. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them and will not cease to do them good: and I will give My <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in their hearts that they may not revolt from Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351277"><a href="../bible/jer032.htm#verse39">Jeremiah&nbsp;32:39-40</a></span> Ezekiel also says: <q>And I will give them one heart, and will put a new spirit in their bowels: and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh: that they may walk in My commandments, and keep My judgments and do them: and that they may be My people, and I may be their God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351278"><a href="../bible/eze011.htm#verse19">Ezekiel&nbsp;11:19-20</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p><strong>That the beginning of our good will and its completion comes from God.</strong></p>

<p>And this plainly teaches us that the beginning of our good will is given to us by the inspiration of the Lord, when He draws us towards the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> either by His own act, or by the exhortations of some man, or by compulsion; and that the consummation of our good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> is granted by Him in the same way: but that it is in our own power to follow up the encouragement and assistance of God with more or less <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and that accordingly we are rightly visited either with reward or with punishment, because we have been either careless or careful to correspond to His design and <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> arrangement made for us with such kindly regard. And this is clearly and plainly described in Deuteronomy. <q>When,</q> says he, <q>the Lord your God shall have brought you into the land which you are going to possess, and shall have destroyed many nations before you, the Hittite, and the Gergeshite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations much more numerous than you are and stronger than you, and the Lord your God shall have delivered them to you, you shall utterly destroy them. You shall make no league with them. Neither shall you make marriage with them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351279"><a href="../bible/deu007.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy&nbsp;7:1-3</a></span> So then Scripture declares that it is the free gift of God that they are brought into the land of promise, that many nations are destroyed before them, that nations more numerous and mightier than the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> are given up into their hands. But whether <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> utterly destroys them, or whether it preserves them alive and spares them, and whether or no it makes a league with them, and makes marriages with them or not, it declares lies in their own power. And by this testimony we can clearly see what we ought to ascribe to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and what to the design and daily assistance of the Lord, and that it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> to give us opportunities of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and prosperous undertakings and victory: but that it is ours to follow up the blessings which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives us with earnestness or indifference. And this same fact we see is plainly taught in the healing of the blind men. For the fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> passed by them, was a free gift of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> and condescension. But the fact that they cried out and said <q>Have mercy on us, Lord, you son of David,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351280"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;20:31</a></span> was an act of their own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and belief. That they received the sight of their eyes was a gift of Divine pity. But that after the reception of any blessing, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> both remain, the case of the ten <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, who were all healed alike, shows us. For when one of them through goodness of will returned thanks, the Lord looking for the nine, and praising the one, showed that He was ever anxious to help even those who were unmindful of His kindness. For even this is a gift of His visitation; viz., that he receives and commends the grateful one, and looks for and censures those who are thankless.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p><strong>That nothing can be done in this world without God.</strong></p>

<p>But it is right for us to hold with unswerving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that nothing whatever is done in this world without God. For we must acknowledge that everything is done either by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> or by His permission, i.e., we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that whatever is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is carried out by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and by His aid, and whatever is the reverse is done by His permission, when the Divine Protection is withdrawn from us for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the hardness of our hearts, and suffers the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and the shameful <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the body to lord it over us. And the words of the Apostle most assuredly teach us this, when he says: <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> God delivered them up to shameful <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>:</q> and again: <q>Because they did not like to have God in their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, God delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not convenient.</q>  And the Lord Himself says by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>But My people did not hear My voice and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> me: Wherefore I gave them up unto their own hearts' <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>. They shall walk after their own inventions.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p><strong>An objection on the power of free will.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: This passage very clearly shows the freedom of the will, where it is said <q>If My people would have hearkened unto Me,</q> and elsewhere <q>But My people would not hear My voice.</q>  For when He says <q>If they would have heard</q> He shows that the decision to yield or not to yield lay in their own power. How then is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> does not depend upon ourselves, if God Himself has given us the power either to hearken or not to hearken?</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p><strong>The answer; viz., that our free will always has need of the help of the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>Paphnutius: You have shrewdly enough noticed how it is said <q>If they would have hearkened to Me:</q> but have not sufficiently considered either who it is who speaks to one who does or does not hearken; or what follows: <q>I should soon have put down their enemies, and laid My hand on those that trouble them.</q>  Let no one then try by a false interpretation to twist that which we brought forward to prove that nothing can be done without the Lord, nor take it in support of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, in such a way as to try to take away from man the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His daily oversight, through this test: <q>But My people did not hear My voice,</q> and again: <q>If My people would have hearkened unto Me, and if <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> would have walked in My ways, etc.:</q> but let him consider that just as the power of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is evidenced by the disobedience of the people, so the daily oversight of God who declares and admonishes him is also shown. For where He says <q>If My people would have hearkened unto Me</q> He clearly implies that He had spoken to them before. And this the Lord was wont to do not only by means of the written law, but also by daily exhortations, as this which is given by Isaiah: <q>All day long have I stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and gain-saying people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351285"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;65:2</a></span> Both points then can be supported from this passage, where it says: <q>If My people would have hearkened, and if <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had walked in My ways, I should soon have put down their enemies, and laid My hand on those that trouble them.</q> For just as <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is shown by the disobedience of the people, so the government of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His assistance is made clear by the beginning and end of the verse, where He implies that He had spoken to them before, and that afterwards He would put down their enemies, if they would have hearkened unto Him. For we have no wish to do away with man's <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> by what we have said, but only to establish the fact that the assistance and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God are necessary to it every day and hour. When he had instructed us with this discourse Abbot Paphnutius dismissed us from his cell before midnight in a state of contrition rather than of liveliness; insisting on this as the chief lesson in his discourse; viz., that when we fancied that by making perfect the first renunciation (which we were endeavouring to do with all our powers), we could climb the heights of perfection, we should make the discovery that we had not yet even begun to dream of the heights to which a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> can rise, since after we had learned some few things about the second renunciation, we should find out that we had not before this even heard a word of the third stage, in which all perfection is comprised, and which in many ways far exceeds these lower ones.</p>
