<h1>Conference 4</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>CONFERENCE OF ABBOT DANIEL. ON THE LUST OF THE FLESH AND OF THE SPIRIT.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>Of the life of Abbot Daniel.</strong></p>

<p>Among the other heroes of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> we also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Abbot Daniel, who was not only the equal of those who dwelt in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Scete in every sort of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but was specially marked by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of humility. This man on account of his purity and gentleness, though in age the junior of most, was preferred to the office of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> by the blessed Paphnutius, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> in the same desert: for the blessed Paphnutius was so delighted with his excellent qualities, that, as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he was his equal in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of life, he was anxious also to make him his equal in the order of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. And since he could not bear that he should remain any longer in an inferior office, and was also anxious to provide a worthy successor to himself in his lifetime, he promoted him to the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.  He however relinquished nothing of his former customary humility, and when the other was present, never took upon himself anything from his advance to a higher order, but when Abbot Paphnutius was offering spiritual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, ever continued to act as a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in the office of his former ministry. However, the blessed Paphnutius though so great a saint as to possess the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of foreknowledge in many matters, yet in this case was disappointed of his hope of the succession and the choice he had made, for he himself passed to God no long time after him whom he had prepared as his successor.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>An investigation of the origin of a sudden change of feeling from inexpressible joy to extreme dejection of mind.</strong></p>

<p>So then we asked this blessed Daniel why it was that as we sat in the cells we were sometimes filled with the utmost <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> of heart, together with inexpressible delight and abundance of the holiest feelings, so that I will not say <em>speech</em>, but <em>feeling</em> could not follow it, and pure <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were readily breathed, and the mind being filled with spiritual fruits, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to God even in sleep could feel that its petitions rose lightly and powerfully to God: and again, why it was that for no reason we were suddenly filled with the utmost grief, and weighed down with unreasonable depression, so that we not only felt as if we ourselves were overcome with such feelings, but also our cell grew dreadful, reading palled upon us, aye and our very <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were offered up unsteadily and vaguely, and almost as if we were intoxicated: so that while we were groaning and endeavouring to restore ourselves to our former disposition, our mind was unable to do this, and the more earnestly it sought to fix again its gaze upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so was it the more vehemently carried away to wandering thoughts by shifting aberrations and so utterly deprived of all spiritual fruits, as not to be capable of being roused from this deadly slumber even by the desire of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, or by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> held out to it. To this he replied.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>His answer to the question raised.</strong></p>

<p>A threefold account of this mental dryness of which you speak has been given by the Elders. For it comes either from carelessness on our part, or from the assaults of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, or from the permission and allowance of the Lord. From carelessness on our part, when through our own faults, coldness has come upon us, and we have behaved carelessly and hastily, and owing to <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> idleness have fed on bad thoughts, and so make the ground of our heart bring forth thorns and thistles; which spring up in it, and consequently make us sterile, and powerless as regards all spiritual fruit and meditation. From the assaults of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> when, sometimes, while we are actually intent on good desires, our enemy with crafty subtlety makes his way into our heart, and without our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> we are drawn away from the best intentions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>How there is a twofold reason for the permission and allowance of God.</strong></p>

<p>But for God's permission and allowance there is a twofold reason. First, that being for a short time forsaken by the Lord, and observing with all humility the weakness of our own heart, we may not be puffed up on account of the previous purity of heart. granted to us by His visitation; and that by proving that when we are forsaken by Him we cannot possibly recover our former state of purity and delight by any groanings and efforts of our own, we may also learn that our previous <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> of heart resulted not from our own earnestness but from His gift, and that for the present time it must be sought once more from His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and enlightenment. But a second reason for this allowance, is to prove our perseverance, and steadfastness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and real desires, and to show in us, with what purpose of heart, or earnestness in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> we seek for the return of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, when He leaves us, and also in order that when we discover with what efforts we must seek for that spiritual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>&mdash; when once it is lost&mdash; and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of purity, we may learn to preserve it more carefully, when once it is secured, and to hold it with firmer grasp. For men are generally more careless about keeping whatever they think can be easily replaced.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>How our efforts and exertions are of no use without God's help.</strong></p>

<p>And by this it is clearly shown that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy always work in us what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and that when it forsakes us, the efforts of the worker are useless, and that however earnestly a man may strive, he cannot regain his former condition without His help, and that this saying is constantly fulfilled in our case: that it is <q>not of him that wills or runs but of God which has mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351287"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;9:16</a></span> And this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on the other hand sometimes does not refuse to visit with that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> inspiration of which you spoke, and with an abundance of spiritual thoughts, even the careless and indifferent; but inspires the unworthy, arouses the slumberers, and enlightens those who are blinded by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and mercifully reproves us and chastens us, shedding itself abroad in our hearts, that thus we may be stirred by the compunction which He excites, and impelled to rise from the sleep of sloth. Lastly we are often filled by His sudden visitation with sweet odours, beyond the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> composition&mdash; so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is ravished with these delights, and caught up, as it were, into an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> of spirit, and becomes oblivious of the fact that it is still in the flesh.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>How it is sometimes to our advantage to be left by God.</strong></p>

<p>But the blessed David recognizes that sometimes this departure of which we have spoken, and (as it were) desertion by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be to some extent to our advantage, so that he was unwilling to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, not that he might not be absolutely forsaken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in anything (for he was aware that this would have been disadvantageous both to himself and to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in its course towards perfection) but he rather entreated that it might be in measure and degree, saying <q>Forsake me not utterly</q>  as if to say in other words: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you forsake your <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to their advantage, in order to prove them, for in no other way could they be tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, unless they were for a little forsaken by You. And therefore I ask not that You should never forsake me, for it would not be well for me not to feel my weakness and say <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me that You have brought me low</q>  nor to have no opportunity of fighting. And this I certainly should not have, if the Divine protection shielded me incessantly and unbrokenly. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> will not dare to attack me while supported by Your defence, as he brings both against me and You this objection and complaint, which he ever slanderously brings against Your champions, <q>Does Job serve God for nought? Have you not made a fence for him and his house and all his substance round about?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351290"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse9">Job&nbsp;1:9-10</a></span> But I rather entreat that You forsake me not utterly&mdash; what the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x1F15;&#x03C9;&#x03C2; &#x03C3;&#x03C6;&#x1F79;&#x03B4;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;</span>, i.e., too much. For, first, as it is advantageous to me for You to forsake me a little, that the steadfastness of my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> may be tried, so it is dangerous if You suffer me to be forsaken excessively in proportion to my faults and what I deserve, since no power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> it is forsaken for too long a time by Your aid, can endure by its own steadfastness, and not immediately give in to the power of the enemy's side, unless You Yourself, as You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the strength of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and moderatest his struggles, <q>Suffer us not to be tempted above that we are able, but makest with the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> a way of escape that we may be able to bear it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351291"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:13</a></span> And something of this sort we read in the book of Judges was <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> designed in the matter of the extermination of the spiritual nations which were opposed to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: <q>These are the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, which the Lord left that by them He might instruct <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that they might learn to fight with their enemies,</q> and again shortly after: <q>And the Lord left them that He might try <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by them, whether they would hear the commandments of the Lord, which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, or not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351292"><a href="../bible/jdg003.htm#verse1">Judges&nbsp;3:1-4</a></span> And this conflict God reserved for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, not from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of their peace, or from a wish to hurt them, but because He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it would be good for them that while they were always oppressed by the attacks of those nations they might not cease to feel themselves in need of the aid of the Lord, and for this reason might ever continue to meditate on Him and invoke His aid, and not grow careless through lazy ease, and lose the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of resisting, and the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For again and again, men whom adversity could not overcome, have been cast down by freedom from care and by prosperity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>Of the value of the conflict which the Apostle makes to consist in the strife between the flesh and the spirit.</strong></p>

<p>This conflict too we read in the Apostle has for our good been placed in our members: <q>For the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh. But these two are opposed to each other so that you should not do what you would.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351293"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> You have here too a contest as it were implanted in our bodies, by the action and arrangement of the Lord. For when a thing exists in everybody universally and without the slightest exception, what else can you think about it except that it belongs to the substance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since the fall of the first man, as it were naturally: and when a thing is found to be congenital with everybody, and to grow with their growth, how can we help believing that it was implanted by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord, not to injure them but to help them? But the reason of this conflict; viz., of flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, he tells us is this: that you should not do what you would. And so, if we fulfil what God arranged that we should not fulfil, i.e., that we should not do what we liked, how can we help believing that it is bad for us? And this conflict implanted in us by the arrangement of the Creator is in a way useful to us, and calls and urges us on to a higher state: and if it ceased, most surely there would ensue on the other hand a peace that is fraught with danger.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>A question, how it is that in the Apostle's chapter, after he has spoken of the lusts of the flesh and spirit opposing one another, he adds a third thing; viz., man's will.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: Although some glimmer of the sense now seems clear to us, yet as we cannot thoroughly grasp the Apostle's meaning, we want you to explain this more clearly to us. For the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of three things seems to be indicated here: first, the struggle of the flesh against the spirit, secondly the desire of the spirit against the flesh, and thirdly our own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, which seems to be placed between the two, and of which it is said: <q>You should not do what you will.</q> And on this subject though as I said we can gather some hints, from what you have explained of the meaning, yet&mdash; since this conference gives the opportunity&mdash; we are anxious to have it more fully explained to us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>The answer on the understanding of one who asks rightly.</strong></p>

<p>Daniel: It belongs to the understanding to discern the distinctions and the drift of questions; and it is a main part of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to understand how <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> you are. Wherefore it is said that <q>if a fool asks questions, it will be accounted wisdom,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351294"><a href="../bible/pro017.htm#verse28">Proverbs&nbsp;17:28</a></span> because, although one who asks questions is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the answer to the question raised, yet as he wisely asks, and learns what he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, this very fact will be counted as wisdom in him, because he wisely discovers what he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of. According then to this division of yours, it seems that in this passage the Apostle mentions three things, the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh against the spirit, and of the spirit against the flesh, the mutual struggle of which against each other appears to have this as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and reason; viz., <q>that,</q> says he, <q>we should not do what we would.</q> There remains then a fourth case, which you have overlooked; viz., that we should do what we would not. Now then, we must first discover the meaning of those two desires, i.e., of the flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, and so next learn to discuss our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, which is placed between the two, and then lastly in the same way we can see what cannot belong to our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>That the word flesh is not used with one single meaning only.</strong></p>

<p>We find that the word flesh is used in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture with many different meanings: for sometimes it stands for the whole man, i.e., for that which consists of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as here <q>And the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351295"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> and <q>All flesh shall see the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of our God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351296"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse6">Luke&nbsp;3:6</a></span> Sometimes it stands for sinful and carnal men, as here <q>My spirit shall not remain in those men, because they are flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351297"><a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;6:3</a></span> Sometimes it is used for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> themselves, as here: <q>But you are not in the flesh but in the spirit,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351298"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;8:9</a></span> and again <q>Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God:</q> lastly there follows, <q>Neither shall corruption inherit incorruption.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351299"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse50">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:50</a></span> Sometimes it stands for consanguinity and relationship, as here: <q>Behold we are your bone and your flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351300"><a href="../bible/2sa005.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;5:1</a></span> and the Apostle says: <q>If by any means I may provoke to emulation them who are my flesh, and save some of them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351301"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;11:14</a></span> We must therefore inquire in which of these four meanings we ought to take the word flesh in this place, for it is clear that it cannot possibly stand as in the passage where it is said <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>,</q> and <q>All flesh shall see the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Neither can it have the same meaning as where it is said <q>My Spirit shall not remain in those men because they are flesh,</q> because the word flesh is not used here as it is there where it stands simply for a sinful man&mdash; when he says The flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. <span class="stiki" id="note351302"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> Nor is he speaking of things material, but of realities which in one and the same man struggle either at the same time or separately, with the shifting and changing of time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>What the Apostle means by flesh in this passage, and what the lust of the flesh is.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore in this passage we ought to take <q>flesh</q> as meaning not man, i.e., his material  substance, but the carnal will and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires, just as <q>spirit</q> does not mean anything material, but the good and spiritual desires of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: a meaning which the blessed Apostle has clearly given just before, where he begins: <q>But I say, walk in the spirit, and you shall not fulfil the desires of the flesh; for the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh: but these are contrary the one to the other, that you may not do what you would.</q> And since these two; viz., the desires of the flesh and of the spirit co-exist in one and the same man, there arises an internal warfare daily carried on within us, while the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh which rushes blindly towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, revels in those delights which are connected with present ease. And on the other hand the desire of the spirit is opposed to these, and wishes to be entirely absorbed in spiritual efforts, so that it actually wants to be rid of even the necessary uses of the flesh, longing to be so constantly taken up with these things as to desire to have no share of anxiety about the weakness of the flesh. The flesh delights in wantonness and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: the spirit does not even tolerate natural desires. The one wants to have plenty of sleep, and to be satiated with food: the other is nourished with <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, so as to be unwilling even to admit of sleep and food for the needful purposes of life. The one longs to be enriched with plenty of everything, the other is satisfied even without the possession of a daily supply of scanty food. The one seeks to look sleek by means of baths, and to be surrounded every day by crowds of flatterers, the other delights in dirt and filth, and the solitude of the inaccessible desert, and dreads the approach of all mortal men. The one lives on the esteem and applause of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the other glories in injuries offered to it, and in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>What is our free will, which stands in between the lust of the flesh and the spirit.</strong></p>

<p>Between these two desires then the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> stands in an intermediate position somewhat worthy of blame, and neither delights in the excesses of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor acquiesces in the sorrows of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Seeking to restrain itself from carnal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in such a way as not nevertheless to be willing to undergo the requisite suffering, and wanting to secure bodily <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> without chastising the flesh, and to acquire purity of heart without the exertion of <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, and to abound in spiritual <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> together with carnal ease, and to attain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of patience without the irritation of contradiction, and to practise the humility of Christ without the loss of worldly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, to aim at the simplicity of religion in conjunction with worldly ambition, to serve Christ not without the praise and favour of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to profess the strictness which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> demands without giving the slightest offense to anybody: in a word, it is anxious to pursue future blessings in such a way as not to lose present ones. And this <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> would never lead us to attain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> perfection, but would plunge us into a most miserable condition of lukewarmness, and make us like those who are rebuked by the Lord's remonstrance in the Apocalypse: <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your works, that you are neither hot nor cold. I would that you were hot or cold. But now you are lukewarm, and I will immediately spew you out of my mouth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351303"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse15">Revelation&nbsp;3:15-16</a></span> were it not that these contentions which rise up on both sides disturb and destroy this condition of lukewarmness. For when we give in to this <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of ours and want to let ourselves go in the direction of this slackness, at once the desires of the flesh start up, and injure us with their sinful <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and do not suffer us to continue in that state of purity in which we delight, and allure us to that cold and thorny path of pleasure which we have to dread. Again, if inflamed with fervour of spirit, we want to root out the works of the flesh, and without any regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness try to raise ourselves altogether to excessive efforts after <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the frailty of the flesh comes in, and recalls us and restrains us from that over excess of spirit which is bad for us: and so the result is that as these two desires are contradicting each other in a struggle of this kind, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, which does not like either to give itself up entirely to carnal desires, nor to throw itself into the exertions which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> calls for, is tempered as it were by a fair balance, while this struggle between the two hinders that more dangerous <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and makes a sort of equitable balance in the scales of our body, which marks out the limits of flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> most accurately, and does not allow the mind inflamed with fervour of spirit to sway to the right hand, nor the flesh to incline through the pricks of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to the left. And while this struggle goes on day after day in us to our profit, we are driven most beneficially to come to that fourth stage which we do not like, so as to gain purity of heart not by ease and carelessness, but by constant efforts and contrition of spirit; to retain our <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of the flesh by prolonged <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, hunger, thirst, and watchfulness; to acquire purpose of heart by reading, <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the wretchedness of solitude; to preserve patience by the endurance of tribulation; to serve our Maker in the midst of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> and abounding insults; to follow after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> if need be amid the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the world and its enmity; and while, with such a struggle going on in our body, we are secured from <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> carelessness, and incited to that effort which is against the grain, and to the desire for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, our proper balance is admirably secured, and on one side the languid choice of our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is tempered by fervour of spirit, and on the other the frigid coldness of the flesh is moderated by a gentle warmth, and while the desire of the spirit does not allow the mind to be dragged into unbridled licence, neither does the weakness of the flesh allow the spirit to be drawn on to unreasonable aspirations after <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, lest in the one case incentives to all kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> might arise, or in the other the earliest of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> might lift its head and wound us with a yet more fatal dart of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>: but a due equilibrium will result from this struggle, and open to us a safe and secure path of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> between the two, and teach the soldier of Christ ever to walk on the King's highway. And thus the result will be that when, in consequence of the lukewarmness arising from this sluggish will of which we have spoken, the mind has been more easily entangled in carnal desires, it is checked by the desire of the spirit, which by no means acquiesces in earthly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and again, if through over much feeling our spirit has been carried in unbounded fervour and towards ill-considered and impossible heights, it is recalled by the weakness of the flesh to sounder considerations and rising above the lukewarm condition of our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> with due proportion and even course proceeds along the way of perfection. Something of this sort we hear that the Lord ordained in the case of the building of that tower in the book of Genesis, where a confusion of tongues suddenly sprang up, and put a stop to the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> attempts of men. For there would have remained there in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, aye and against the interest of those who had begun to assail His Divine Majesty, an agreement boding no good, unless by God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> the difference of languages, raising disturbances among them, had forced them because of the variations of their words to go on to a better condition, and a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and valuable discord had recalled to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> those whom a ruinous union had driven to destruction, as when divisions arose they began to experience <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness of which when puffed up by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> plots they had hitherto <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> nothing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><strong>Of the advantage of the delay which results from the struggle between flesh and spirit.</strong></p>

<p>But from the differences which this conflict causes, there arises a delay that is so far advantageous to us, and from this struggle an adjournment that is for our good, so that while through the resistance of the material body we are hindered from carrying out those things which we have wickedly conceived with our minds, we are sometimes recalled to a better mind either by penitence springing up, or by some better thoughts which usually come to us when delay in carrying out things, and time for reflection intervene. Lastly, those who, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, are not prevented from carrying out the desires of their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> by any hindrances of the flesh, I mean devils and spiritual wickednesses, these, since they have fallen from a higher and angelical state, we see are in a worse plight than men, much in as much as (owing to the fact that opportunity is always present to gratify their desires) they are not delayed from irrevocably performing whatever <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> they have imagined because as their mind is quick to conceive it, so their substance is ready and free to carry it out; and while a short and easy method is given them of doing what they wish, no salutary second thoughts come in to amend their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> intention.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>Of the incurable depravity of spiritual wickednesses.</strong></p>

<p>For a spiritual substance and one that is not tied to any material flesh has no excuse for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought which arises within, and also shuts out forgiveness for its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it is not harassed as we are by incentives of the flesh without, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is simply inflamed by the fault of a perverse will. And therefore its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is without forgiveness and its weakness without remedy. For as it falls through the allurements of no earthly matter, so it can find no pardon or place for repentance. And from this we can clearly gather that this struggle which arises in us of the flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> against each other is not merely harmless, but actually extremely useful to us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>Of the value of the lust of the flesh against the spirit in our case.</strong></p>

<p>To begin with, because it is an immediate reproof of our sloth and carelessness, and like some energetic schoolmaster who never allows us to deviate from the line of strict discipline, and if our carelessness has ever so little exceeded the limits of due gravity which become it, it immediately excites us by the stimulus of desire, and chides us and recalls us to due moderation. Secondly, because, in the matter of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and perfect purity, when by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we see that we have been for some time kept from carnal pollution, in order that we may not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that we can no longer be disturbed by the motions of the flesh and thereby be elated and puffed up in our secret hearts as if we no longer bore about the corruption of the flesh, it humbles and checks us, and reminds us by its pricks that we are but men.  For as we ordinarily fall without much thought into other kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and those worse and more harmful, and are not so easily ashamed of committing them, so in this particular one the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is especially humbled, and by means of this illusion it is stung by the recollection of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that have been neglected, as it sees clearly that it is rendered unclean by natural emotions, of which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing while it was still more unclean through spiritual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and so coming back at once to the cure of its former sluggishness, it is warned both that it ought not to trust in the attainments of purity in the past, which it sees to be lost by ever so small a falling away from the Lord, and also that it cannot attain the gift of this purity except by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> alone, since actual experience somehow or other teaches us that if we are anxious to reach abiding perfection of heart we must constantly endeavour to obtain the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of humility.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>Of the excitements of the flesh, without the humiliation of which we should fall more grievously.</strong></p>

<p>To the fact then that the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which results from this purity would be more dangerous than all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and wickednesses, and that we should on that account gain no reward for any height of perfect <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, we may call as witnesses those powers of which we spoke before, which since it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that they experience no such fleshly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, were cast down from their high and heavenly estate in everlasting destruction simply from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of heart. And so we should be altogether hopelessly lukewarm, since we should have no warning of carelessness on our part implanted either in our body or in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, nor should we ever strive to reach the glow of perfection, or even keep to strict frugality and abstinence, were it not that this excitement of the flesh springs up and humbles us and baffles us and makes us keen and anxious about purifying ourselves from spiritual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p><strong>Of the lukewarmness of eunuchs.</strong></p>

<p>Lastly, on this account in those who are Eunuchs, we often detect the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of this lukewarmness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, because, as they are so to speak free from the needs of the flesh, they fancy that they have no need either of the trouble of bodily abstinence, or of contrition of heart; and being rendered slack by this freedom from anxiety, they make no efforts either <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to seek or to acquire perfection of heart or even purity from spiritual faults. And this condition which is the result of their state in the flesh, becomes natural, which is altogether a worse state. For he who passes from the state of coldness to that of lukewarmness is branded by the Lord's words as still more hateful.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p><strong>The question what is the difference between the carnal and natural man.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: You have, it seems to us, very clearly shown the value of the struggle which is raised between the flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, so that we can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it can in a sort of way be grasped by us; and therefore we want to have this also explained to us in the same way; viz., what is the difference between the carnal and the natural man, or how the natural man can be worse than the carnal.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p><strong>The answer concerning the threefold condition of souls.</strong></p>

<p>Daniel: There are, according to the statements of Scripture, three kinds of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; the first is the carnal, the second the natural, and the third the spiritual: which we find are thus described by the Apostle. For of the carnal he says: <q>I gave you milk to drink, not meat: for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet carnal.</q> And again: <q>For whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351305"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:2-3</a></span> Concerning the natural he also speaks as follows: <q>But the natural man perceives not the things that are of the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it is foolishness to him.</q> But concerning the spiritual: <q>But the spiritual man judges all things: and he himself is judged by no man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351306"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:14-15</a></span> And again <q>You who are spiritual instruct such ones in the spirit of meekness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351307"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;6:1</a></span> And so, though at our renunciation we ceased to be carnal, i.e., we began to separate ourselves from intercourse with those in the world, and to have nothing to do with open pollution of the flesh, we must still be careful to strive with all our might to attain immediately a spiritual condition, lest haply we flatter ourselves because we seem as far as the outer man is concerned to have renounced this world and got rid of the defilement of carnal fornication, as if by this we had reached the heights of perfection; and thence become careless and indifferent about purifying ourselves from other affections, and so being kept back between these two, become unable to reach the stage of spiritual advancement; either because we think that it is amply sufficient for our perfection if we seem to separate ourselves, as regards the outward man, from intercourse with this world and from its pleasure, or because we are free from corruption and carnal intercourse, and thus we find ourselves in that lukewarm condition which is considered the worst of all, and discover that we are spewed out of the mouth of the Lord, in accordance with these words of His: <q>I would that you were hot or cold. But now you are lukewarm and I will begin to spew you out of My mouth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351308"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse15">Revelation&nbsp;3:15-16</a></span> And not without good reason does the Lord declare that those whom he has previously received in the bowels of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and who have become shamefully lukewarm, shall be spewed out and rejected from His bosom: in as much as, though they might have yielded Him some health-giving subsistence, they preferred to be torn away from His heart: thus becoming far worse than those who had never found their way into the Lord's mouth as food, just as we turn away with loathing from that which nausea compels us to bring up. For whatever is cold is warmed when received into the mouth and is received with satisfaction and good results. But whatever has been once rejected owing to its miserable luke-warmness, we cannot&mdash; I will not say touch with the lips&mdash; but even look on from a distance without the greatest disgust. Rightly then is he said to be worse, because the carnal man, i.e., the worldly man and the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, is more readily brought to saving conversion and to the heights of perfection than one who has been professed as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, but has not, as his rule directs, laid hold on the way of perfection, and so has once for all drawn back from that fire of spiritual fervour. For the former is at last broken down by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh, and acknowledges his uncleanness, and in his compunction hastens from carnal pollution to the fountain of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> cleansing, and the heights of perfection, and in his horror at that cold state of infidelity in which he finds himself, he is kindled with the fire of the spirit and flies the more readily to perfection. For one who has, as we said, once started with a lukewarm beginning, and has begun to abuse the name of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and who has not laid hold on the way of this profession with the humility and fervour that he ought, when once he is infected by this miserable plague, and is as it were unstrung by it, can no longer of himself discern what is perfect nor learn from the admonitions of another. For he says in his heart that which the Lord tells us: <q>Because I am rich and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and want nothing;</q> and so this which follows is at once applied to him: <q>But you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351309"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse17">Revelation&nbsp;3:17</a></span> and he is so far in a worse condition than a worldly man, because he has no idea that he is wretched or blind or naked or requires cleansing, or needs to be directed and taught by any one; and on this account he receives no sound advice as he does not realise that he is weighted with the name of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and is lowered in the judgment of all, whereas, though everybody believes him to be a saint and regards him as a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he must hereafter be subjected to a stricter judgment and punishment. Lastly, why should we any longer linger over those things which we have sufficiently discovered and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by experience? We have often seen those who were cold and carnal, i.e., worldly men and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, attain spiritual warmth: but lukewarm and <q>natural</q> men never. And these too we read in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> are <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> of the Lord, so that a charge is given to spiritual and learned men to desist from warning and teaching them, and not to sow the seed of the life-giving word in ground that is barren and unfruitful and choked by noxious thorns; but that they should scorn this, and rather cultivate fallow ground, i.e., that they should transfer all their care and teaching, and their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the life-giving word to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and worldly men: as we thus read: <q>Thus says the Lord to the men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351310"><a href="../bible/jer004.htm#verse3">Jeremiah&nbsp;4:3</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p><strong>Of those who renounce the world but ill.</strong></p>

<p>In the last place I am ashamed to say how we find that a large number have made their renunciation in such a way that we find that they have altered nothing of their former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and habits, but only their state of life and worldly garb. For they are eager in amassing <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which they never had before, or else do not give up that which they had, or which is still sadder, they actually strive to augment it under this excuse; viz., that they assert that it is right that they should always support with it their relations or the brethren, or they hoard it under pretence of starting congregations which they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they can preside over as Abbots. But if only they would sincerely seek after the way of perfection, they would rather endeavour with all their might and main to attain to this: viz., that they might strip themselves not only of their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> but of all their former likings and occupations, and place themselves unreservedly and entirely under the guidance of the Elders so as to have no anxiety not merely about others, but even about themselves. But on the contrary we find that while they are eager to be set over their brethren, they are never subject to their Elders themselves, and, with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> for their starting point, while they are quite ready to teach others they take no trouble to learn themselves or to practise what they are to teach: and so it is sure to end in their becoming, as the Saviour said, <q>blind leaders of the blind</q> so that <q>both fall into the ditch.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351311"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;15:14</a></span> And this <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> though there is only one kind of it, yet takes a twofold form. One form continually puts on the appearance of seriousness and gravity, the other breaks out with unbridled freedom into silly giggling and laughing. The former delights in not talking: the latter thinks it hard to be kept to the restraint of silence, and has no scruples about talking freely on matters that are unsuitable and foolish, while it is ashamed to be thought inferior to or less well informed than others. The one on account of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> seeks clerical office, the other looks down upon it, since it fancies that it is unsuitable or beneath its former dignity and life and the deserts of its birth. And which of these two should be accounted the worse each man must consider and decide for himself. At any rate the kind of disobedience is one and the same, if a man breaks the Elder's commands whether it be owing to <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in work, or to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of ease: and it is as hurtful to upset the rules of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for the sake of sleep, as it is for the sake of vigilance, and it is just the same to transgress the Abbot's orders in order to read, as it is to slight them in order to sleep: nor is there any difference in the incentive to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> if you neglect a brother, whether it is because of your fast or because of your breakfast: except that those faults which seem to show themselves under the guise of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and in the form of spirituality are worse and less likely to be cured than those which arise openly and from carnal pleasures. For these latter, like sicknesses which are perfectly plain and visible, are grappled with and cured, while the former, since they are covered under the cloak of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, remain uncured, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> their victims to fall into a more dangerous and deadly state of ill health.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p><strong>Of those who having made light of great things busy themselves about trifles.</strong></p>

<p>For how can we show how absurd it is that we see that some men after their first enthusiasm of renunciation in which they forsook their estates and vast <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and the service of the world, and betook themselves to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, are still earnestly devoted to those things which cannot altogether be cut off, and which we cannot do without in this state of life, even though they are small and trifling things; so that in their case the anxiety about these trifles is greater than their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of all their property. And it certainly will not profit them much that they have disregarded greater riches and property, if they have only transferred their affections (on account of which they were to make light of them) to small and trifling things. For the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> of which they cannot be guilty in the matter of really valuable things, they retain with regard to commoner matters, and so show that they have not got rid of their former greed but only changed its object. For if they are too careful about their mats, baskets, blankets, books, and other trifles such as these, the same passion holds them captive as before. And they actually guard and defend their rights over them so jealously as to get <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with their brethren about them, and, what is worse, they are not ashamed to quarrel over them. And being still troubled by the bad effects of their former <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, they are not content to possess those things which the needs and requirements of the body compel a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> to have, according to the common number and measure, but here too they show the greediness of their heart, as they try to have those things which they are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to use, better got up than the others; or, exceeding all due bounds, keep as their special and peculiar property and guard from the touch of others that which ought to belong to all the brethren alike. As if the difference of metals, and not the passion of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> was what mattered; and as if it was wrong to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> about big things, while one might innocently be about trifling matters: and as if we had not given up all our precious things just in order that we might learn more readily to think nothing about trifles! For what difference does it make whether one gives way to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> in the matter of large and splendid things, or in the matter of the merest trifles, except that we ought to think a man so far worse if he has made light of great things and then is a slave to little things? And so that sort of renunciation of the world does not attain perfection of heart, because though it ranks as poverty it still keeps the mind of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>.</p>
