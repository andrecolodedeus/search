<h1>Conference 6</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>CONFERENCE OF ABBOT THEODORE. ON THE DEATH OF THE SAINTS.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>Description of the wilderness, and the question about the death of the saints.</strong></p>

<p>In the district of Palestine near the village of Tekoa which had the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of producing the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Amos, <span class="stiki" id="note351363"><a href="../bible/amo001.htm#verse1">Amos&nbsp;1:1</a></span> there is a vast desert which stretches far and wide as far as Arabia and the dead sea, into which the streams of Jordan enter and are lost, and where are the ashes of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>. In this district there lived for a long while <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the most perfect life and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, who were suddenly destroyed by an incursion of Saracen <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>:  whose bodies we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> were seized upon with the greatest veneration  both by the Bishops of the neighbourhood and by the whole populace of Arabia, and deposited among the relics of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, so that swarms of people from two towns met, and made terrible <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon each other, and in their struggle actually came to blows for the possession of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spoil, while they strove among themselves with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> as to which of them had the better claim to bury them and keep their relics&mdash; the one party boasting of their vicinity to the place of their abode, the other of the fact that they were near the place of their birth. But we were upset by this and being disturbed either on our own account or on account of some of the brethren who were in no small degree scandalized at it, inquired why men of such illustrious merits and of so great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> should be thus slain by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and why the Lord permitted such a crime to be committed against his servants, so as to give up into the hands of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men those who were the admiration of everybody: and so in our grief we came to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Theodore, a man who excelled in practical common sense. For he was living in Cell&aelig;,  a place that lies between Nitria and Scete, and is five miles distant from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Nitria, and cut off by eighty intervening miles of desert from the wilderness of Scete where we were living. And when we had made our complaint to him about the death of the men mentioned above, and expressed our surprise at the great patience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He suffered men of such worth to be killed in this way, so that those who ought to be able by the weight of their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> to deliver others from trials of this kind, could not save themselves from the hands of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men (and asked) why it was that God allowed so great a crime to be committed against his servants, then the blessed Theodore replied.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>Abbot Theodore's answer to the question proposed to him.</strong></p>

<p>This question often exercises the minds of those who have not much <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the prizes and rewards of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (which are not given in this world, but laid up for the future) are bestowed in the short space of this mortal life. But we whose hope in Christ is not only in this life, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest, as the Apostle says, we should be <q>of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> most miserable</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351367"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:19</a></span> (because as we receive none of the promises in this world we should for our unbelief lose them also in that to come) ought not wrongly to follow their ideas, lest through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> real explanation, we should hesitate and tremble and fail in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, if we find ourselves given up to such men; and should ascribe to God <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> or carelessness about the affairs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>&mdash; a thing which it is almost a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to mention&mdash; because He does not protect in their <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> men who are living an upright and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, nor requite good men with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things in this world; and so we should deserve to fall under the condemnation of those whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Zephaniah rebukes, saying <q>who say in their hearts the Lord will not do good, nor will He do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351368"><a href="../bible/zep001.htm#verse12">Zephaniah&nbsp;1:12</a></span> or at least be found among those of whom we are told that they <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> God with such complaints as this: <q>Every one that does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the sight of the Lord, and such please Him: for surely where is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of judgment?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351369"><a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse17">Malachi&nbsp;2:17</a></span> Adding further that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> which is described in the same way in what follows: <q>He labours in vain that serves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and what profit is it that we have kept His ordinances, and walked sorrowful before the Lord? Wherefore now we call the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, for they that work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> are enriched, and they have tempted <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are preserved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351370"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse14">Malachi&nbsp;3:14-15</a></span> Wherefore that we may avoid this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which is the root and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this most deadly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, we ought in the first place to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is really good, and what is bad, and so finally if we grasp the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> scriptural meaning of these words, and not the false popular one, we shall escape being deceived by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of unbelievers.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>Of the three kinds of things there are in the world; viz., good, bad, and indifferent.</strong></p>

<p>Altogether there are three kinds of things in the world; viz., good, bad, and indifferent. And so we ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is properly good, and what is bad, and what is indifferent, that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be supported by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and stand firm in all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. We must then <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that in things which are merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> there is no real good except <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, which leads us with unfeigned <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to things divine, and makes us constantly adhere to that unchanging good. And on the other hand we ought not to call anything bad, except <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone, which separates us from the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and unites us to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But those things are indifferent which can be appropriated to either side according to the fancy or wish of their owner, as for instance riches, power, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, bodily strength, good health, beauty, life itself, and death, poverty, bodily infirmities, injuries, and other things of the same sort, which can contribute either to good or to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as the character and fancy of their owner directs. For riches are often serviceable for our good, as the Apostle says, who charges <q>the rich of this world to be ready to give, to distribute to the needy, to lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that</q> by this means <q>they may lay hold on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351371"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:17-19</a></span> And according to the gospel they are a good thing for those who <q>make to themselves friends of the unrighteous <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351372"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;16:9</a></span> And again, they can be drawn in the direction of what is bad when they are amassed only for the sake of hoarding them or for a life of luxury, and are not employed to meet the wants of the poor. And that power also and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and bodily strength and good health are indifferent and available for either (good or bad) can easily be shown from the fact that many of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> enjoyed all these things and were in positions of great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and blessed with bodily strength, and yet are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have been most acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And on the contrary those who have wrongfully abused these things and perverted them for their own purposes are not without good reason punished or destroyed, as the Book of Kings shows us has often happened. And that even life and death are in themselves indifferent the birth of S. John and of Judas proves. For in the case of the one his life was so profitable to himself that we are told that his birth brought <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to others also, as we read <q>And many shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at his birth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351373"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;1:14</a></span> but of the life of the other it is said: <q>It were good for that man if he had never been born.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351374"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;26:24</a></span> Further it is said of the death of John and of all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <q>Right dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>:</q>  but of that of Judas and men like him <q>The death of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  And how useful bodily sickness sometimes may be the blessing on Lazarus, the beggar who was full of sores, shows us. For Scripture makes mention of no other good qualities or deserts of his, but it was for this fact alone; viz., that he endured want and bodily sickness with the utmost patience, that he was deemed worthy of the blessed lot of a place in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom. <span class="stiki" id="note351377"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;16:20</a></span> And with regard to want and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and injuries which everybody thinks to be bad, how useful and necessary they are is clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by this fact; viz., that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> not only never tried to avoid them, but actually either sought them with all their powers or bravely endured them, and thus became the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and obtained the reward of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, as the blessed Apostle chants: <q>For which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I delight myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, in distresses for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong, for power is made perfect in infirmity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351378"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:9-10</a></span> And therefore those who are exalted with the greatest riches and honours and powers of this world, should not be deemed to have secured their chief good out of them (for this is shown to consist only in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>) but only something indifferent, because just as to good men who use them well and properly they will be found to be useful and convenient (for they afford them opportunities for good works and fruits which shall endure to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life), so to those who wrongfully abuse their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, they are useless and out of place, and furnish occasions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>How evil cannot be forced on any one by another against his will.</strong></p>

<p>Preserving then these distinctions clear and fixed, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that there is nothing good except <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> alone, and nothing bad except <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone and separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us now carefully consider whether God ever allows <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be forced on his <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> either by Himself or by some one else. And you will certainly find that this never happens. For another can never possibly force the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> upon anyone, who does not consent and who resists, but only on one who admits it into himself through sloth and the corrupt desire of his heart. Finally, when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> having exhausted all his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> devices had tried to force upon the blessed Job this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and had not only stripped him of all his worldly goods, but also after that terrible and utterly unlooked for calamity of bereavement through the death of his seven children, had heaped upon him dreadful wounds and intolerable tortures from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he tried in vain to fasten on him the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he remained steadfast through it all, never brought himself to consent to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>An objection, how God Himself can be said to create evil.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: We often read in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture that God has created <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or brought it upon men, as is this passage: <q>There is none beside Me. I am the Lord, and there is none else: I form the light and create darkness, I make peace, and create <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351379"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;45:6-7</a></span> And again: <q>Shall there be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in a city which the Lord has not done?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351380"><a href="../bible/amo003.htm#verse6">Amos&nbsp;3:6</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>The answer to the question proposed.</strong></p>

<p>Theodore: Sometimes <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture is wont by an improper use of terms to use <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a></q> for <q>affliction;</q> not that these are properly and in their nature <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, but because they are imagined to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> by those on whom they are brought for their good. For when divine judgment is reasoning with men it must speak with the language and feelings of men. For when a doctor for the sake of health with good reason either cuts or cauterizes those who are suffering from the inflammation of ulcers, it is considered an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by those who have to bear it. Nor are the spur and the whip pleasant to a restive horse. Moreover all chastisement seems at the moment to be a bitter thing to those who are chastised, as the Apostle says: <q>Now all chastisement for the present indeed seems not to bring with it <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> but sorrow; but afterwards it will yield to them that are exercised by it most peaceable fruits of righteousness,</q> and <q>whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives: for what son is there whom the father does not correct?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351381"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;12:6-11</a></span> And so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are sometimes wont to stand for afflictions, as where we read: <q>And God repented of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which He had said that He would do to them and He did it not.</q>  And again: <q>For You, Lord, are gracious and merciful, patient and very merciful and ready to repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q>  i.e., of the sufferings and losses which You are forced to bring upon us as the reward of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that these are profitable to some men, and certainly not through any jealousy of their safety, but with an eye to their good, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> thus: <q>Add <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to them, O Lord, add <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> ones of the earth;</q>  and the Lord Himself says <q>Lo, I will bring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> upon them,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351385"><a href="../bible/jer011.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;11:11</a></span> i.e., sorrows, and losses, with which they shall for the present be chastened for their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> health, and so shall be at length driven to return and hasten back to Me whom in their prosperity they scorned. And so that these are originally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> we cannot possibly assert: for to many they conduce to their good and offer the occasions of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> bliss, and therefore (to return to the question raised) all those things, which are thought to be brought upon us as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> by our enemies or by any other people, should not be counted as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, but as things indifferent. For in the end they will not be what he thinks, who brought them upon us in his rage and fury, but what <em>he</em> makes them who endures them. And so when death has been brought upon a saint, we ought not to think that an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has happened to him but a thing indifferent; which is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man, while to the good it is rest and freedom from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. <q>For death is rest to a man whose way is hidden.</q>  And so a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man does not suffer any loss from it, because he suffers nothing strange, but by the crime of an enemy he only receives (and not without the reward of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life) that which would have happened to him in the course of nature, and pays the debt of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> death, which must be paid by an inevitable law, with the interest of a most fruitful passion, and the recompense of a great reward.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>A question whether the man who causes the death of a good man is guilty, if the good man is the gainer by his death.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: Well then, if a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man does not only suffer no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by being killed, but actually gains a reward from his suffering, how can we accuse the man who has done him no harm but good by killing him?</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>The answer to the foregoing question.</strong></p>

<p>Theodore: We are talking about the actual qualities of things good and bad, and what we call indifferent; and not about the characters of the men who do these things. Nor ought any bad or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man to go unpunished because his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deed</a> was not able to do harm to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man. For the endurance and goodness of a righteous man are of no profit to the man who is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his death or suffering, but only to him who patiently endures what is inflicted on him. And so the one is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> punished for savage cruelty, because he meant to injure him, while the other nevertheless suffers no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because in the goodness of his heart he patiently endures his <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and sufferings, and so causes all those things, which were inflicted upon him with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> intent, to turn out to his advantage, and to conduce to the bliss of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>The case of Job who was tempted by the devil and of the Lord who was betrayed by Judas: and how prosperity as well as adversity is advantageous to a good man.</strong></p>

<p>For the patience of Job did not bring any gain to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, through making him a better man by his <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, but only to Job himself who endured them bravely; nor was Judas granted freedom from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, because his act of betrayal contributed to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. For we must not regard the result of the deed, but the purpose of the doer. Wherefore we should always cling to this assertion; viz., that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot be brought upon a man by another, unless a man has admitted it by his sloth or feebleness of heart: as the blessed Apostle confirms this opinion of ours in a verse of Scripture: <q>But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all things work together for good to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351387"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;8:28</a></span> But by saying <q>All things work together for good,</q> he includes everything alike, not only things fortunate, but also those which seem to be misfortunes: through which the Apostle tells us in another place that he himself has passed, when he says: <q>By the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</q> i.e., <q>Through <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and dishonour, through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report and good report, as deceivers and yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as sorrowful but always rejoicing, as needy and yet enriching many:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351388"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:7-10</a></span> All those things then which are considered fortunate, and are called those <q>on the right hand,</q> which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostle designates by the terms <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and good report; and those too which are counted misfortunes, which he clearly means by dishonour and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report, and which he describes as <q>on the left hand,</q> become to the perfect man <q>the armour of righteousness,</q> if when they are brought upon him, he bears them bravely: because, as he fights with these, and uses those very weapons with which he seems to be attacked, and is protected by them as by bow and sword and stout shield against those who bring these things upon him, he secures the advantage of his patience and goodness, and obtains a grand triumph of steadfastness by means of those very weapons of his enemies which are hurled against him to kill him; and if only he is not elated by success or cast down by failure, but ever marches straightforward on the king's highway, and does not swerve from that state of tranquillity as it were to the right hand, when <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> overcomes him, nor let himself be driven so to speak to the left hand, when misfortunes overwhelm him, and sorrow holds sway. For <q>Much peace have they that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Your law, and to them there is no stumbling block.</q>  But of those who shift about according to the character and changes of the several chances which happen to them, we read: <q>But a fool will change like the moon.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351390"><a href="../bible/sir027.htm#verse11">Sirach&nbsp;27:11</a></span> For just as it is said of men who are perfect and wise: <q>To them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God all things work together for good,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351391"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;8:28</a></span> so of those who are weak and foolish it is declared that <q>everything is against a foolish man,</q>  for he gets no profit out of prosperity, nor does adversity make him any better. For it requires as much goodness to bear sorrows bravely, as to be moderate in prosperity: and it is quite certain that one who fails in one of these, will not bear up under the other. But a man can be more easily overcome by prosperity than by misfortunes: for these sometimes restrain men against their will and make them <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and through most salutary sorrow <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> less, and make them better: while prosperity puffs up the mind with soothing but most pernicious flatteries and when men are secure in the prospect of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> dashes them to the ground with a still greater destruction.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>Of the excellence of the perfect man who is figuratively spoken of as ambidextrous.</strong></p>

<p>Those are they then who are figuratively spoken of in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture as <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BC;&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03B4;&#x1F73;&#x03BE;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>, i.e., ambidextrous, as Ehud is described in the book of Judges <q>who used either hand as the right  hand.</q> And this power we also can spiritually acquire, if by making a right and proper use of those things which are fortunate, and which seem to be <q>on the right hand,</q> as well as of those which are unfortunate and as we call it <q>on the left hand,</q> we make them both belong to the right side, so that whatever turns up proves in our case, to use the words of the Apostle, <q>the armour of righteousness.</q> For we see that the inner man consists of two parts, and if I may be allowed the expression, two hands, nor can any of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> do without that which we call the left hand: but by means of it the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is shown, where a man by skilful use can turn both hands into right hands. And in order to make our meaning clearer, the saint has for his right hand his spiritual achievements, in which he is found when with fervent spirit he gets the better of his desires and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, when he is free from all attacks of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and without any effort or difficulty rejects and cuts off all carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when he is exalted above the earth and regards all things present and earthly as light smoke or vain shadows, and scorns them as what is about to vanish away, when with an overflowing heart he not only longs most intensely for the future but actually sees it the more clearly, when he is more effectually fed on spiritual contemplations, when he sees heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> more brightly laid open to him, when he pours forth his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to God with greater purity and readiness, when he is so inflamed with fervent of spirit as to pass with the utmost readiness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to things invisible and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, so as scarcely to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he any longer remains in the flesh. He has also a left hand, when he is entangled in the toils of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, when he is inflamed with the heat of desire for carnal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, when he is set on fire by emotion towards rage and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, when he is overcome by being puffed up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or vainglory, when he is oppressed by a sorrow that works death, when he is shaken to pieces by the contrivances and attacks of accidie, and when he has lost all spiritual warmth, and grows indifferent with a sort of lukewarmness and unreasonable grief so that not only is he forsaken by good and kindling thoughts, but actually Psalms, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, reading, and retirement in his cell all pall upon him, and all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> exercises seem by an intolerable and horrible loathing to have lost their savour. And when a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is troubled in this way, then he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he is attacked <q>on the left hand.</q> Anyone therefore who is not at all puffed up through the aid of vainglory by any of those things on the right hand which we have mentioned, and who struggles manfully against those on the left hand, and does not yield to despair and give in, but rather on the other hand seizes the armour of patience to practise himself in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>&mdash; this man can use both hands as right hands, and in each action he proves triumphant and carries off the prize of victory from that condition on the left hand as well as that on the right. Such, we read, was the reward which the blessed Job obtained who was certainly crowned (for a victory) on the right hand, when he was the father of seven sons and walked as a rich and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> man, and yet offered daily <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the Lord for their purification, in his anxiety that they might prove acceptable and dear to God rather than to himself, when his gates stood open to every stranger, when he was <q>feet to lame and eyes to blind,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351394"><a href="../bible/job029.htm#verse15">Job&nbsp;29:15</a></span> when the shoulders of the suffering were kept warm by the wool of his sheep, when he was a father to <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and a husband to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, when he did not even in his heart <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at the fall of his enemy. And again it was the same man who with still greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> triumphed over adversity on the left hand, when deprived in one moment of his seven sons he was not as a father overcome with bitter grief but as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> servant of God rejoiced in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his Creator. When instead of being a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> man he became poor, naked instead of rich, pining away instead of strong, despised and contemptible instead of famous and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, and yet preserved his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of mind unshaken, when, lastly, bereft of all his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and substance he took up his abode on the dunghill, and like some stern executioner of his own body scraped with a potsherd the matter that broke out, and plunging his fingers deep into his wounds dragged out on every side masses of worms from his limbs. And in all this he never fell into despair and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, nor murmured at all against his Creator. Moreover also so little was he overcome by such a weight of bitter <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> that the cloak which out of all his former property remained to cover his body, and which alone could be saved from destruction by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> because he was clothed with it, he rent and cast off, and covered with it his nakedness which he voluntarily endured, which the terrible robber had brought upon him. The hair of his head too, which was the only thing left untouched out of all the remains of his former <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, he shaved and cast to his tormentor, and cutting off even that which his savage foe had left to him he exulted over him and mocked him with that celestial cry of his: <q>If we have received good at the hand of the Lord, should we not also receive <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; as it has pleased the Lord, so is it done; blessed be the name of the Lord.</q>  I should also with good reason call Joseph ambidextrous, as in prosperity he was very dear to his father, affectionate to his brethren, acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in adversity was chaste, and faithful to the Lord, in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> most kind to the prisoners, forgetful of wrongs, generous to his enemies; and to his brethren who were <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of him and as far as lay in their powers, his murderers, he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> not only affectionate but actually munificent. These men then and those who are like them are rightly termed <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BC;&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03B4;&#x1F73;&#x03BE;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>, i.e., ambidextrous. For they can use either hand as the right hand, and passing through those things which the Apostle enumerates can fairly say: <q>Through the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, through <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and dishonour, through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report and good report, etc.</q> And of this right and left hand Solomon speaks as follows in the Song of songs, in the person of the bride: <q>His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351396"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse6">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:6</a></span> And while this passage shows that both are useful, yet it puts one under the head, because misfortunes ought to be subject to the control of the heart, since they are only useful for this; viz., to train us for a time and discipline us for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and make us perfect in the matter of patience. But the right hand she hopes will ever cling to her to cherish her and hold her fast in the blessed embrace of the Bridegroom, and unite her to him indissolubly. We shall then be ambidextrous, when neither abundance nor want affects us, and when the former does not entice us to the luxury of a dangerous carelessness, while the latter does not draw us to despair, and complaining; but when, giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in either case alike, we gain one and the same advantage out of good and bad fortune. And such that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> ambidextrous man, the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, testifies that he himself was, when he says: <q>For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both how to be brought low and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to abound: everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things in Him which strengthens me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351397"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse11">Philippians&nbsp;4:11-13</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>Of the two kinds of trials, which come upon us in a three-fold way.</strong></p>

<p>Well then, though we say that trial is twofold, i.e., in prosperity and in adversity, yet you must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are tried in three different ways. Often for their probation, sometimes for their improvement, and in some cases because their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> deserve it. For their probation indeed, as we read that the blessed <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Job and many of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> endured countless tribulations; or this which is said to the people in Deuteronomy by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>And you shall remember all the way through which the Lord your God has brought you for forty years through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, to afflict you and to prove you, and that the things that were in your heart might be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, whether you would keep His Commandments or no:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351398"><a href="../bible/deu008.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy&nbsp;8:2</a></span> and this which we find in the Psalms: <q>I <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> you at the waters of strife.</q>  To Job also: <q>Do you think that I have spoken for any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> than that you might be seen to be righteous?</q>  But for improvement, when God chastens his righteous ones for some small and venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or to raise them to a higher state of purity, and delivers them over to various trials, that He may purge away all their unclean thoughts, and, to use the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> word, the <q>dross,</q> which he sees to have collected in their secret parts, and may thus transmit them like pure gold, to the judgment to come, as He allows nothing to remain in them for the fire of judgment to discover when hereafter it searches them with penal torments according to this saying: <q>Many are the tribulations of the righteous.</q>  And: <q>My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord, neither be wearied while you are rebuked by Him.

We find, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that even for lighter faults some men have received the same sentence of death in this world, as that with which those men were punished who, as we said before, were the authors of a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> falling away: as happened in the case of the man who gathered sticks on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note351426"><a href="../bible/num015.htm#verse32">Numbers&nbsp;15:32</a></span> and in that of Ananias and Sapphira, who through the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief kept back some portion of their goods: not that the guilt of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was equal, but because they were the first found out in a new kind of transgression, and so it was right that as they had given to others an example of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so also they should give them an example of punishment and of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, that anyone, who should attempt to copy them, might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that (even if his punishment were postponed in this life) he would be punished in the same way that they were at the trial of the judgment hereafter. And, since in our desire to run through the different kinds of trials and punishments we seem to have wandered somewhat from our subject, on which we were saying that the perfect man will always remain steadfast in either kind of trial, now let us return to it once more.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>How the upright man ought to be like a stamp not of wax but of hard steel.</strong></p>

<p>And so the mind of the upright man ought not to be like wax or any other soft material which always yields to the shape of what presses on it, and is stamped with its form and impress and keeps it until it takes another shape by having another seal stamped upon it; and so it results that it never retains its own form but is turned and twisted about to correspond to whatever is pressed upon it. But he should rather be like some stamp of hard steel, that the mind may always keep its proper form and shape inviolate, and may stamp and imprint on everything which occurs to it the marks of its own condition, while upon it itself nothing that happens can leave any mark.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><strong>A question whether the mind can constantly continue in one and the same condition.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: But can our mind constantly preserve its condition unaltered, and always continue in the same state?</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>The answer to the point raised by the questioner.</strong></p>

<p>Theodore: It is needful that one must either, as the Apostle says, <q>be renewed in the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351427"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse23">Ephesians&nbsp;4:23</a></span> and daily advance by <q>pressing forward to those things which are before,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351428"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> or, if one neglects to do this, the sure result will be to go back, and become worse and worse. And therefore the mind cannot possibly remain in one and the same state. Just as when a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by pulling hard, is trying to force a boat against the stream of a strong current he must either stem the rush of the torrent by the force of his arms, and so mount to what is higher up, or letting his hands slacken be whirled headlong down stream. Wherefore it will be a clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of our failure if we find that we have gained nothing more, nor should we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that we have altogether gone back, whenever we find that we have not advanced upwards, because, as I said, the mind of man cannot possibly continue in the same condition, nor so long as he is in the flesh will any of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> ever reach the height of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, so that they continue unalterable. For something must either be added to them or taken away from them, and in no creature can there be such perfection, as not to be subject to the feeling of change; as we read in the book of Job: <q>What is man that he should be without spot, and he that is born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that he should appear just? Behold among His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> none is unchangeable, and the heavens are not pure in His sight.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351429"><a href="../bible/job015.htm#verse14">Job&nbsp;15:14-15</a></span> For we confess that God only is unchangeable, who alone is thus addressed by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <q>But You are the same,</q>  and who says of Himself <q>I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and I change not,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351431"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse6">Malachi&nbsp;3:6</a></span> because He alone is by nature always good, always full and perfect, and one to whom nothing can ever be added, or from whom nothing can be taken away. And so we ought always with incessant care and anxiety to give ourselves up to the acquirement of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and constantly to occupy ourselves with the practice of it, lest, if we cease to go forward, the result should immediately be a going back. For, as we said, the mind cannot continue in one and the same condition, I mean without receiving addition to or diminution of its good qualities. For to fail to gain new ones, is to lose them, because when the desire of making progress ceases, there the danger of going back is present.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>How one loses by going away from one's cell.</strong></p>

<p>And so we ought always to remain shut up in our cell. For whenever a man has strayed from it and returns fresh to it and begins again to live there he will be upset and disturbed. For if he has let it go he cannot without difficulty and pains recover that fixed purpose of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which he had gained when he remained in his cell; and as through this he has gone back, he will not think anything of the advance which he has missed, and which he would have secured if he had not allowed himself to leave his cell, but he will rather congratulate himself if he finds that he has regained that condition from which he fell away. For just as time once lost and gone cannot any more be recovered, so neither can those advantages which have been missed be restored: for whatever earnest purpose of the mind there may be afterwards, it will be the profit of the day then present, and the gain that belongs to the time that then is, and will not make up for the gain that has been once for all lost.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>How even celestial powers above are capable of change.</strong></p>

<p>But that even the powers above are, as we said, subject to change is shown by those who fell from their ranks through the fault of a corrupt will. Wherefore we ought not to think that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of those is unchangeable, who remain in the blessed condition in which they were created, simply because they were not in like manner led astray to choose the worse part. For it is one thing to have a nature incapable of change, and another thing for a man through the efforts of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and by guarding what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be kept from change. For everything that is secured or preserved by care, can also be lost by carelessness. And so we read: <q>Call no man blessed before his death,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351432"><a href="../bible/sir011.htm#verse30">Sirach&nbsp;11:30</a></span> because so long as a man is still engaged in the struggle, and if I may use the expression, still wrestling&mdash; even though he generally conquers and carries off many prizes of victory&mdash;yet he can never be free from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and from the suspicion of an uncertain issue. And therefore God alone is called unchangeable and good, as His goodness is not the result of effort, but a natural possession, and so He cannot be anything but good. No <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> then can be acquired by man without the possibility of change, but in order that when it once exists it may be continually preserved, it must be watched over with the same care and diligence with which it was acquired.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p><strong>That no one is dashed to the ground by a sudden fall.</strong></p>

<p>But we must not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that anyone slips and comes to grief by a sudden fall, but that he falls by a hopeless collapse either from being deceived by beginning his training badly, or from the good qualities of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> failing through a long course of carelessness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and so his faults gaining ground upon him little by little. For <q>loss goes before destruction, and an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought before a fall,</q>  just as no house ever falls to the ground by a sudden collapse, but only when there is some flaw of long standing in the foundation, or when by long continued neglect of its inmates, what was at first only a little drip finds its way through, and so the protecting walls are by degrees ruined, and in consequence of long standing neglect the gap becomes larger, and break away, and in time the drenching storm and rain pours in like a river: for <q>by slothfulness a building is cast down, and through the weakness of hands the house shall drop through.</q>  And that the same thing happens spiritually to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the same Solomon thus tells us in other words, when he says: <q>water dripping drives a man out of the house on a stormy day.</q>  Elegantly then does he compare carelessness of mind to a roof, and to tiles that have not been looked after, through which in the first instance only very slight drippings (so to speak) of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> make their way to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: but if these are not heeded, as being but small and trifling, then the beams of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> will decay and be carried away by a great tempest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, through which <q>on a stormy day,</q> i.e., in the time of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> attack will assail us, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be driven forth from the abode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in which, as long as it preserved all watchful diligence, it had remained as in a house that belonged to it.</p>

<p>And so when we had heard this, we were so immensely delighted with our spiritual repast, that the mental pleasure with which we were filled by this conference outweighed the sorrow which we had experienced before from the death of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. For not only were we instructed in things about which we had been puzzled, but we also learned from the raising of that question some things, which our understanding had been too small for us to ask about.</p>
