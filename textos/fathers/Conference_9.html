<h1>Conference 9</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. JOHN CASSIAN</em></strong> <p>THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT ISAAC. ON PRAYER.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><strong>Introduction to the Conference.</strong></p>

<p>What was promised in the second book of the Institutes  on continual and unceasing perseverance in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, shall be by the Lord's help fulfilled by the Conferences of this Elder, whom we will now bring forward; viz., Abbot Isaac:  and when these have been propounded I think that I shall have satisfied the commands of Pope Castor of blessed memory, and your wishes, O blessed Pope Leontius and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother Helladius, and the length of the book in its earlier part may be excused, though, in spite of our endeavour not only to compress what had to be told into a brief discourse, but also to pass over very many points in silence, it has been extended to a greater length than we intended. For having commenced with a full discourse on various regulations which we have thought it well to curtail for the sake of brevity, at the close the blessed Isaac spoke these words.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>The words of Abbot Isaac on the nature of prayer.</strong></p>

<p>The aim of every <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and the perfection of his heart tends to continual and unbroken perseverance in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and, as far as it is allowed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty, strives to acquire an immovable tranquillity of mind and a perpetual purity, for the sake of which we seek unweariedly and constantly to practise all bodily labours as well as contrition of spirit. And there is between these two a sort of reciprocal and inseparable union. For just as the crown of the building of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, so unless everything has been united and compacted by this as its crown, it cannot possibly continue strong and stable. For lasting and continual calmness in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, of which we are speaking, cannot be secured or consummated without them, so neither can those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which lay its foundations be fully gained without persistence in it. And so we shall not be able either to treat properly of the effect of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, or in a rapid discourse to penetrate to its main end, which is acquired by labouring at all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, unless first all those things which for its sake must be either rejected or secured, are singly enumerated and discussed, and, as the Parable in the gospel teaches, <span class="stiki" id="note351584"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;14:28</a></span> whatever concerns the building of that spiritual and most lofty tower, is reckoned up and carefully considered beforehand. But yet these things when prepared will be of no use nor allow the lofty height of perfection to be properly placed upon them unless a clearance of all faults be first undertaken, and the decayed and dead rubbish of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> be dug up, and the strong foundations of simplicity and humility be laid on the solid and (so to speak) living soil of our breast, or rather on that rock of the gospel, <span class="stiki" id="note351585"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;6:48</a></span> and by being built in this way this tower of spiritual <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> will rise, and be able to stand unmoved, and be raised to the utmost heights of heaven in full assurance of its stability. For if it rests on such foundations, then though heavy storms of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> break over it, though mighty torrents of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> beat against it like a battering ram, though a <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> tempest of spiritual foes dash against it and attack it, yet not only will no ruin overtake it, but the onslaught will not injure it even in the slightest degree.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>How pure and sincere prayer can be gained.</strong></p>

<p>And therefore in order that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> may be offered up with that earnestness and purity with which it ought to be, we must by all means observe these rules. First all anxiety about carnal things must be entirely got rid of; next we must leave no room for not merely the care but even the recollection of any business affairs, and in like manner also must lay aside all backbitings, vain and incessant chattering, and buffoonery; <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> above all and disturbing moroseness must be entirely destroyed, and the deadly taint of carnal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> be torn up by the roots. And so when these and such like faults which are also visible to the eyes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, are entirely removed and cut off, and when such a purification and cleansing, as we spoke of, has first taken place, which is brought about by pure simplicity and innocence, then first there must be laid the secure foundations of a deep humility, which may be able to support a tower that shall reach the sky; and next the spiritual structure of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> must be built up upon them, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> kept free from all conversation and from roving thoughts that thus it may little by little begin to rise to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to spiritual insight. For whatever our mind has been thinking of before the hour of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, is sure to occur to us while we are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> through the activity of the memory. Wherefore what we want to find ourselves like while we are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, that we ought to prepare ourselves to be before the time for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For the mind in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is formed by its previous condition, and when we are applying ourselves to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the images of the same actions and words and thoughts will dance before our eyes, and make us either <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, as in our previous condition, or gloomy, or recall our former <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and business, or make us shake with foolish laughter (which I am ashamed to speak of) at some silly joke, or smile at some action, or fly back to our previous conversation. And therefore if we do not want anything to haunt us while we are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, we should be careful before our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, to exclude it from the shrine of our heart, that we may thus fulfill the Apostle's injunction: <q>Pray without ceasing;</q> and: <q>In every place lifting up <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hands without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> or disputing.</q>  For otherwise we shall not be able to carry out that charge unless our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, purified from all stains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and given over to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as to its natural good, feed on the continual <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><strong>Of the lightness of the soul which may be compared to a wing or feather.</strong></p>

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not inaptly compared to a very fine feather or very light wing, which, if it has not been damaged or affected by being spoilt by any moisture falling on it from without, is borne aloft almost naturally to the heights of heaven by the lightness of its nature, and the aid of the slightest breath: but if it is weighted by any moisture falling upon it and penetrating into it, it will not only not be carried away by its natural lightness into any aerial flights but will actually be borne down to the depths of earth by the weight of the moisture it has received. So also our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, if it is not weighted with faults that touch it, and the cares of this world, or damaged by the moisture of injurious <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, will be raised as it were by the natural blessing of its own purity and borne aloft to the heights by the light breath of spiritual meditation; and leaving things low and earthly will be transported to those that are heavenly and invisible. Wherefore we are well warned by the Lord's command: <q>Take heed that your hearts be not weighed down by surfeiting and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> and the cares of this world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351587"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;21:34</a></span> And therefore if we want our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to reach not only the sky, but what is beyond the sky, let us be careful to reduce our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, purged from all earthly faults and purified from every stain, to its natural lightness, that so our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> may rise to God unchecked by the weight of any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><strong>Of the ways in which our soul is weighed down.</strong></p>

<p>But we should notice the ways in which the Lord points out that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is weighed down: for He did not mention <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or fornication, or <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, or rapine, which everybody <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be deadly and damnable, but surfeiting and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, and the cares or anxieties of this world: which men of this world are so far from avoiding or considering damnable that actually some who (I am ashamed to say) call themselves <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> entangle themselves in these very occupations as if they were harmless or useful. And though these three things, when literally given way to weigh down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and separate it from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and bear it down to things earthly, yet it is very easy to avoid them, especially for us who are separated by so great a distance from all converse with this world, and who do not on any occasion have anything to do with those visible cares and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> and surfeiting. But there is another surfeiting which is no less dangerous, and a spiritual <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> which it is harder to avoid, and a care and anxiety of this world, which often ensnares us even after the perfect renunciation of all our goods, and abstinence from wine and all feastings and even when we are living in solitude&mdash; and of such the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says: <q>Awake, you that are drunk but not with wine;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351588"><a href="../bible/joe001.htm#verse5">Joel&nbsp;1:5</a></span> and another: <q>Be astonished and wonder and stagger: be drunk and not with wine: be moved, but not with <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351589"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;29:9</a></span> And of this <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> the wine must consequently be what the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> calls <q>the fury of dragons</q>: and from what root the wine comes you may hear: <q>From the vineyard of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>,</q> he says, <q>is their vine, and their branches from Gomorrha.</q> Would you also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about the fruit of that vine and the seed of that branch? <q>Their grape is a grape of gall, theirs is a cluster of bitterness</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351590"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse32">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:32-33</a></span> for unless we are altogether cleansed from all faults and abstaining from the surfeit of all <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, our heart will without <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> from wine and excess of any feasting be weighed down by a <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> and surfeiting that is still more dangerous. For that worldly cares can sometimes fall on us who mix with no actions of this world, is clearly shown according to the rule of the Elders, who have laid down that anything which goes beyond the necessities of daily food, and the unavoidable needs of the flesh, belongs to worldly cares and anxieties, as for example if, when a job bringing in a penny would satisfy the needs of our body, we try to extend it by a longer toil and work in order to get twopence or threepence; and when a covering of two tunics would be enough for our use both by night and day, we manage to become the owners of three or four, or when a hut containing one or two cells would be sufficient, in the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of worldly ambition and greatness we build four or five cells, and these splendidly decorated, and larger than our needs required, thus showing the passion of worldly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> whenever we can.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><strong>Of the vision which a certain Elder saw concerning the restless work of a brother.</strong></p>

<p>And that this is not done without the prompting of devils we are taught by the surest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, for when one very highly esteemed Elder was passing by the cell of a certain brother who was suffering from this mental disease of which we have spoken, as he was restlessly toiling in his daily occupations in building and repairing what was unnecessary, he watched him from a distance breaking a very hard stone with a heavy hammer, and saw a certain <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> standing over him and together with him striking the blows of the hammer with joined and clasped hands, and urging him on with fiery incitements to diligence in the work: and so he stood still for a long while in astonishment at the force of the fierce <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> and the deceitfulness of such an illusion. For when the brother was worn out and tired and wanted to rest and put an end to his toil, he was stimulated by the spirit's prompting and urged on to resume his hammer again and not to cease from devoting himself to the work which he had begun, so that being unweariedly supported by his incitements he did not feel the harm that so great labour was doing him. At last then the old man, disgusted at such a horrid mystification by a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, turned aside to the brother's cell and saluted him, and asked <q>what work is it, brother, that you are doing?</q> and he replied: <q>We are working at this awfully hard stone, and we can hardly break it at all.</q> Whereupon the Elder replied: <q>You were right in saying ' <em>we</em> can,' for you were not alone, when you were striking it, but there was another with you whom you did not see, who was standing over you not so much to help you as urge you on with all his force.</q> And thus the fact that the disease of worldly vanity has not got hold of our hearts, will be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by no mere abstinence from those affairs which even if we want to engage in, we cannot carry out, nor by the despising of those matters which if we pursued them would make us remarkable in the front rank among spiritual <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as well as among worldly men, but only when we reject with inflexible firmness of mind whatever ministers to our power and seems to be veiled in a show of right. And in reality these things which seem trivial and of no consequence, and which we see to be permitted indifferently by those who belong to our calling, none the less by their character affect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than those more important things, which according to their condition usually intoxicate the senses of worldly people and which do not allow  a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> to lay aside earthly impurities and aspire to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on whom his attention should ever be fixed; for in his case even a slight separation from that highest good must be regarded as present death and most dangerous destruction. And when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been established in such a peaceful condition, and has been freed from the meshes of all carnal desires, and the purpose of the heart has been steadily fixed on that which is the only highest good, he will then fulfil this Apostolic precept: <q>Pray without ceasing;</q> and: <q>in every place lifting up <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hands without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and disputing:</q>  for when by this purity (if we can say so) the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are engrossed, and are re-fashioned out of their earthly condition to bear a spiritual and angelic likeness, whatever it receives, whatever it takes in hand, whatever it does, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> will be perfectly pure and sincere.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><strong>A question how it is that it is harder work to preserve than to originate good thoughts.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: If only we could keep as a lasting possession those spiritual thoughts in the same way and with the same ease with which we generally conceive their germs! For when they have been conceived in our hearts either through the recollection of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> or by the memory of some spiritual actions, or by gazing upon heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, they vanish all too soon and disappear by a sort of unnoticed flight. And when our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has discovered some other occasions for spiritual emotions, different ones again crowd in upon us, and those which we had grasped are scattered, and lightly fly away so that the mind retaining no persistency, and keeping of its own power no firm hand over <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thoughts, must be thought, even when it does seem to retain them for a while, to have conceived them at random and not of set purpose. For how can we think that their rise should be ascribed to our own will, if they do not last and remain with us? But that we may not owing to the consideration of this question wander any further from the plan of the discourse we had commenced, or delay any longer the explanation promised of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, we will keep this for its own time, and ask to be informed at once of the character of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, especially as the blessed Apostle exhorts us at no time to cease from it, saying <q>Pray without ceasing.</q> And so we want to be taught first of its character, i.e., how <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> ought <em>always</em> to be offered up, and then how we can secure this, whatever it is, and practise it without ceasing. For that it cannot be done by any light purpose of heart both daily experience and the explanation of four <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> show us, as you have laid it down that the aim of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and the height of all perfection consist in the consummation of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><strong>Of the different characters of prayer.</strong></p>

<p>Isaac: I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that all kinds of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> cannot be grasped without great purity of heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the illumination of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For there are as many of them as there can be conditions and characters produced in one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or rather in all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. And so although we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that owing to our dulness of heart we cannot see all kinds of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, yet we will try to relate them in some order, as far as our slender experience enables us to succeed. For according to the degree of the purity to which each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> attains, and the character of the state in which it is sunk owing to what happens to it, or is by its own efforts renewing itself, its very <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> will each moment be altered: and therefore it is quite clear that no one can always offer up uniform <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. For every one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> in one way when he is brisk, in another when he is oppressed with a weight of sadness or despair, in another when he is invigorated by spiritual achievements, in another when cast down by the burden of attacks, in another when he is asking pardon for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in another when he asks to obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or else <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for the destruction of some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in another when he is pricked to the heart by the thought of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of future judgment, in another when he is aglow with the hope and desire of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come, in another when he is taken up with affairs and dangers, in another when he is in peace and security, in another when he is enlightened by the revelation of heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and in another when he is depressed by a sense of barrenness in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and dryness in feeling.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><strong>Of the fourfold nature of prayer.</strong></p>

<p>And therefore, when we have laid this down with regard to the character of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, although not so fully as the importance of the subject requires, but as fully as the exigencies of time permit, and at any rate as our slender abilities admit, and our dulness of heart enables us&mdash;a still greater difficulty now awaits us; viz., to expound one by one the different kinds of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which the Apostle divides in a fourfold manner, when he says as follows: <q>I exhort therefore first of all that supplications, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, intercessions, thanksgivings be made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351593"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:1</a></span> And we cannot possibly <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this division was not idly made by the Apostle. And to begin with we must investigate what is meant by supplication, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, by intercession, and by thanksgiving. Next we must inquire whether these four kinds are to be taken in hand by him who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> all at once, i.e., are they all to be joined together in every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>&mdash;or whether they are to be offered up in turns and one by one, as, for instance, ought at one time supplications, at another <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, at another intercessions, and at another thanksgivings to be offered, or should one man present to God supplications, another <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, another intercessions, another thanksgivings, in accordance with that measure of age, to which each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is advancing by earnestness of purpose?</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>Of the order of the different kinds laid down with regard to the character of prayer.</strong></p>

<p>And so to begin with we must consider the actual force of the names and words, and discuss what is the difference between <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication and intercession; then in like manner we must investigate whether they are to be offered separately or all together; and in the third place must examine whether the particular order which is thus arranged by the Apostle's authority has anything further to teach the hearer, or whether the distinction simply is to be taken, and it should be considered that they were arranged by him indifferently in such a way: a thing which seems to me utterly absurd. For one must not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> uttered anything casually or without reason through the Apostle. And so we will, as the Lord grants us, consider them in the same order in which we began.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><strong>Of Supplications.</strong></p>

<p><q>I exhort therefore first of all that supplications be made.</q> Supplication is an imploring or petition concerning <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in which one who is sorry for his present or past <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> asks for pardon.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><strong>Of Prayer.</strong></p>

<p>Prayers are those by which we offer or vow something to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03BA;&#x1F75;</span>, i.e., a vow. For where we read in Greek <span class="greek">&#x1F30;&#x1F70;&#x03C2; &#x1F10;&#x03C5;&#x03BA;&#x1F71;&#x03C2; &#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C5; &#x03C4;&#x1FF6; &#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x1FF6; &#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03B4;&#x1F7D;&#x03C3;&#x03C9;</span>, in Latin we read: <q>I will pay my vows unto the Lord;</q>  where according to the exact force of the words it may be thus represented: <q>I will pay my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> unto the Lord.</q> And this which we find in Ecclesiastes: <q>If you vow a vow unto the Lord do not delay to pay it,</q> is written in Greek likewise: <span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x1F71;&#x03BD; &#x1F10;&#x1F7B;&#x03BE;&#x1FC3; &#x1F10;&#x03C5;&#x03C7;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x1FF6; &#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x1FF6;,</span> i.e., <q>If you pray a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> unto the Lord, do not delay to pay it,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351595"><a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;5:3</a></span> which will be fulfilled in this way by each one of us. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, when we renounce this world and promise that being dead to all worldly actions and the life of this world we will serve the Lord with full purpose of heart. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> when we promise that despising secular honours and scorning earthly riches we will cleave to the Lord in all sorrow of heart and humility of spirit. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> when we promise that we will ever maintain the most perfect purity of body and steadfast patience, or when we vow that we will utterly root out of our heart the roots of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or of sorrow that works death. And if, enervated by sloth and returning to our former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> we fail to do this we shall be guilty as regards our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and vows, and these words will apply to us: <q>It is better not to vow, than to vow and not to pay,</q> which can be rendered in accordance with the Greek: <q>It is better for you not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> than to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and not to pay.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><strong>Of Intercession.</strong></p>

<p>In the third place stand intercessions, which we are wont to offer up for others also, while we are filled with fervour of spirit, making request either for those dear to us or for the peace of the whole world, and to use the Apostle's own phrase, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <q>for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for kings and all that are in authority.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351597"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:1-2</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><strong>Of Thanksgiving.</strong></p>

<p>Then in the fourth place there stand thanksgivings which the mind in ineffable transports offers up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either when it recalls God's past benefits or when it contemplates His present ones, or when it looks forward to those great ones in the future which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has prepared for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him. And with this purpose too sometimes we are wont to pour forth richer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, while, as we gaze with pure eyes on those rewards of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> which are laid up in store hereafter, our spirit is stimulated to offer up unspeakable thanks to God with boundless <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><strong>Whether these four kinds of prayers are necessary for everyone to offer all at once or separately and in turns.</strong></p>

<p>And of these four kinds, although sometimes occasions arise for richer and fuller <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (for from the class of supplications which arises from sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and from the kind of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which flows from confidence in our offerings and the performance of our vows in accordance with a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and from the intercession which proceeds from fervour of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and from the thanksgiving which is born of the consideration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s blessings and His greatness and goodness, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that oftentimes there proceed most fervent and ardent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> so that it is clear that all these kinds of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of which we have spoken are found to be useful and needful for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so that in one and the same man his changing feelings will give utterance to pure and fervent petitions now of supplications, now of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, now of intercessions) yet the first seems to belong more especially to beginners, who are still troubled by the stings and recollection of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; the second to those who have already attained some loftiness of mind in their spiritual progress and the quest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; the third to those who fulfil the completion of their vows by their works, and are so stimulated to intercede for others also through the consideration of their weakness, and the earnestness of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; the fourth to those who have already torn from their hearts the guilty thorns of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and thus being now free from care can contemplate with a pure mind the beneficence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His compassions, which He has either granted in the past, or is giving in the present, or preparing for the future, and thus are borne onward with fervent hearts to that ardent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which cannot be embraced or expressed by the mouth of men. Sometimes however the mind which is advancing to that perfect state of purity and which is already beginning to be established in it, will take in all these at one and the same time, and like some incomprehensible and all-devouring flame, dart through them all and offer up to God inexpressible <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the purest force, which the Spirit Itself, intervening with groanings that cannot be uttered, while we ourselves understand not, pours forth to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, grasping at that hour and ineffably pouring forth in its supplications things so great that they cannot be uttered with the mouth nor even at any other time be recollected by the mind. And thence it comes that in whatever degree any one stands, he is found sometimes to offer up pure and devout <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; as even in that first and lowly station which has to do with the recollection of future judgment, he who still remains under the punishment of terror and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of judgment is so smitten with sorrow for the time being that he is filled with no less keenness of spirit from the richness of his supplications than he who through the purity of his heart gazes on and considers the blessings of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and is overcome with ineffable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and delight. For, as the Lord Himself says, he begins to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the more, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he has been forgiven the more. <span class="stiki" id="note351598"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;7:47</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><strong>Of the kinds of prayer to which we ought to direct ourselves.</strong></p>

<p>Yet we ought by advancing in life and attaining to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to aim rather at those kinds of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which are poured forth either from the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come or from fervour of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, or which at least, to speak more humbly and in accordance with the measure of beginners, arise for the acquirement of some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or the extinction of some fault. For otherwise we shall not possibly attain to those sublimer kinds of supplication of which we spoke, unless our mind has been little by little and by degrees raised through the regular course of those intercessions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p><strong>How the four kinds of supplication were originated by the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>These four kinds of supplication the Lord Himself by His own example vouchsafed to originate for us, so that in this too He might fulfil that which was said of Him: <q>which Jesus began both to do and to teach.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351599"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;1:1</a></span> For He made use of the class of <em>supplication</em> when He said: <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;</q> or this which is chanted in His Person in the Psalm: <q>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, look upon Me, why have You forsaken me,</q>  and others like it. It is <em><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a></em> where He says: <q>I have magnified You upon the earth, I have finished the work which You gave Me to do,</q> and this: <q>And for their sakes I sanctify Myself that they also may be sanctified in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351601"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;17:4,&nbsp;19</a></span> It is <em>intercession</em> when He says: <q>Father, those Whom You have given me, I will that they also may be with Me that they may see My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which You have given Me;</q> or at any rate when He says: <q>Father, forgive them for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.</q>  It is <em>thanksgiving</em> when He says: <q>I confess to You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hid these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in Your sight:</q> or at least when He says: <q>Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that You hear Me always.</q>  But though our Lord made a distinction between these four kinds of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> as to be offered separately and one by one according to the scheme which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of, yet that they can all be embraced in a perfect <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> at one and the same time He showed by His own example in that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which at the close of S. John's gospel we read that He offered up with such fullness. From the words of which (as it is too long to repeat it all) the careful inquirer can discover by the order of the passage that this is so. And the Apostle also in his Epistle to the Philippians has expressed the same meaning, by putting these four kinds of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in a slightly different order, and has shown that they ought sometimes to be offered together in the fervour of a single <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, saying as follows: <q>But in everything by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351604"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;4:6</a></span> And by this he wanted us especially to understand that in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication thanksgiving ought to be mingled with our requests.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p><strong>Of the Lord's Prayer.</strong></p>

<p>And so there follows after these different kinds of supplication a still more sublime and exalted condition which is brought about by the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of God alone and by fervent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, transporting and flinging itself into <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Him, addresses God most familiarly as its own Father with a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of its own. And that we ought earnestly to seek after this condition the formula of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a> teaches us, saying <q>Our Father.</q> When then we confess with our own mouths that the God and Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is our Father, we profess immediately that we have been called from our condition as slaves to the adoption of sons, adding next <q>Which art in heaven,</q> that, by shunning with the utmost horror all lingering in this present life, which we pass upon this earth as a pilgrimage, and what separates us by a great distance from our Father, we may the rather hasten with all eagerness to that country where we confess that our Father dwells, and may not allow anything of this kind, which would make us unworthy of this our profession and the dignity of an adoption of this kind, and so deprive us as a disgrace to our Father's inheritance, and make us incur the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and severity. To which state and condition of sonship when we have advanced, we shall immediately be inflamed with the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which belongs to good sons, so that we shall bend all our energies to the advance not of our own profit, but of our Father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, saying to Him: <q>Hallowed be Your name,</q> testifying that our desire and our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, becoming imitators of Him who said: <q>He who speaks of himself, seeks his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But He who seeks the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him who sent Him, the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and there is no unrighteousness in Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351605"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;7:18</a></span> Finally the chosen vessel being filled with this feeling wished that he could be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> from Christ <span class="stiki" id="note351606"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;9:3</a></span> if only the people belonging to Him might be increased and multiplied, and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the whole nation of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> accrue to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His Father; for with all assurance could he wish to die for Christ as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that no one perished for life.

<p><strong>Of the clause <q>Your kingdom come.</q></strong></p>

<p>The second petition of the pure heart desires that the kingdom of its Father may come at once; viz., either that whereby Christ reigns day by day in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (which comes to pass when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> rule is cast out of our hearts by the destruction of foul <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and God begins to hold sway over us by the sweet odour of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and, fornication being overcome, charity reigns in our hearts together with tranquillity, when rage is conquered; and humility, when <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is trampled under foot) or else that which is promised in due time to all who are perfect, and to all the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when it will be said to them by Christ: <q>Come you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351611"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;25:34</a></span> (as the heart) with fixed and steadfast gaze, so to speak, yearns and longs for it and says to Him <q>Your kingdom come.</q> For it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of its own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> that when He shall appear, it will presently share His lot.

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p><strong>Of the clause <q>Your will be done.</q></strong></p>

<p>The third petition is that of sons: <q>Your will be done as in heaven so on earth.</q> There can now be no grander <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> than to wish that earthly things may be made equal with things heavenly: for what else is it to say <q>Your will be done as in heaven so on earth,</q> than to ask that men may be like <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and that as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is ever fulfilled by them in heaven, so also all those who are on earth may do not their own but His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>?

For where it says <q>daily</q> it shows that without it we cannot live a spiritual life for a single day. Where it says <q>today</q> it shows that it must be received daily and that yesterday's supply of it is not enough, but at it must be given to us today also in like manner. And our daily need of it suggests to us that we ought at all times to offer up this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, because there is no day on which we have no need to strengthen the heart of our inner man, by eating and receiving it, although the expression used, <q>today</q> may be taken to apply to his present life, i.e., while we are living in this world supply us with this bread. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it will be given to those who deserve it by You hereafter, but we ask that You would grant it to us today, because unless it has been vouchsafed to a man to receive it in this life he will never be partaker of it in that.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p><strong>Of the clause: <q>Forgive us our debts, etc.</q></strong></p>

<p><q>And forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors.</q> O unspeakable mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which has not only given us a form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and taught us a system of life acceptable to Him, and by the requirements of the form given, in which He charged us always to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, has torn up the roots of both <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and sorrow, but also gives to those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> an opportunity and reveals to them a way by which they may move a merciful and kindly <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> to be pronounced over them and which somehow gives us a power by which we can moderate the sentence of our Judge, drawing Him to forgive our offenses by the example of our forgiveness: when we say to Him: <q>Forgive us as we also forgive.</q> And so without anxiety and in confidence from this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> a man may ask for pardon of his own offenses, if he has been forgiving towards his own debtors, and not towards those of his Lord. For some of us, which is very bad, are inclined to show ourselves calm and most merciful in regard to those things which are done to God's detriment, however great the crimes may be, but to be found most hard and inexorable exactors of debts to ourselves even in the case of the most trifling wrongs. Whoever then does not from his heart forgive his brother who has offended him, by this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> calls down upon himself not forgiveness but condemnation, and by his own profession asks that he himself may be judged more severely, saying: Forgive me as I also have forgiven. And if he is repaid according to his own request, what else will follow but that he will be punished after his own example with implacable <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and a sentence that cannot be remitted? And so if we want to be judged mercifully, we ought also to be merciful towards those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against us. For only so much will be remitted to us, as we have remitted to those who have injured us however spitefully. And some dreading this, when this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is chanted by all the people in church, silently omit this clause, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest they may seem by their own utterance to bind themselves rather than to excuse themselves, as they do not understand that it is in vain that they try to offer these quibbles to the Judge of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who has willed to show us beforehand how He will judge His suppliants. For as He does not wish to be found harsh and inexorable towards them, He has marked out the manner of His judgment, that just as we desire to be judged by Him, so we should also judge our brethren, if they have wronged us in anything, for <q>he shall have judgment without mercy who has shown no mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351615"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse13">James&nbsp;2:13</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p><strong>Of the clause: <q>Lead us not into temptation.</q></strong></p>

<p>Next there follows: <q>And lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>,</q> on which there arises no unimportant question, for if we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may not be suffered to be tempted, how then will our power of endurance be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, according to this text: <q>Every one who is not tempted is not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351616"><a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse11">Sirach&nbsp;34:11</a></span> and again: <q>Blessed is the man that endures <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351617"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse12">James&nbsp;1:12</a></span> The clause then, <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>,</q> does not mean this; viz., do not permit us ever to be tempted, but do not permit us when we fall into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to be overcome. For Job was tempted, but was not led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. For he did not ascribe folly to God nor <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, nor with impious mouth did he yield to that wish of the tempter toward which he was drawn. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was tempted, Joseph was tempted, but neither of them was led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> for neither of them yielded his consent to the tempter. Next there follows: <q>But deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> i.e., do not suffer us to be tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> above that we are able, but <q>make with the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> a way also of escape that we may be able to bear it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351618"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:13</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p><strong>How we ought not to ask for other things, except only those which are contained in the limits of the Lord's Prayer.</strong></p>

<p>You see then what is the method and form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> proposed to us by the Judge Himself, who is to be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to by it, a form in which there is contained no petition for riches, no thought of honours, no request for power and might, no mention of bodily health and of temporal life. For He who is the Author of Eternity would have men ask of Him nothing uncertain, nothing paltry, and nothing temporal. And so a man will offer the greatest insult to His Majesty and Bounty, if he leaves on one side these <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> petitions and chooses rather to ask of Him something transitory and uncertain; and will also incur the indignation rather than the propitiation of the Judge by the pettiness of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a></p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p><strong>Of the character of the sublimer prayer.</strong></p>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> then though it seems to contain all the fullness of perfection, as being what was originated and appointed by the Lord's own authority, yet lifts those to whom it belongs to that still higher condition of which we spoke above, and carries them on by a loftier stage to that ardent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and tried by but very few, and which to speak more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is ineffable; which transcends all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> thoughts, and is distinguished, I will not say by any sound of the voice, but by no movement of the tongue, or utterance of words, but which the mind enlightened by the infusion of that heavenly light describes in no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and confined language, but pours forth richly as from copious fountain in an accumulation of thoughts, and ineffably utters to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, expressing in the shortest possible space of time such great things that the mind when it returns to its usual condition cannot easily utter or relate. And this condition our Lord also similarly prefigured by the form of those supplications which, when he retired alone in the mountain He is said to have poured forth in silence, and when being in an agony of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> He shed forth even drops of blood, as an example of a purpose which it is hard to imitate.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p><strong>Of the different causes of conviction.</strong></p>

<p>But who is able, with whatever experience he may be endowed, to give a sufficient account of the varieties and reasons and grounds of conviction, by which the mind is inflamed and set on fire and incited to pure and most fervent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>? And of these we will now by way of specimen set forth a few, as far as we can by God's enlightenment recollect them. For sometimes a verse of any one of the Psalms gives us an occasion of ardent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> while we are singing. Sometimes the harmonious modulation of a brother's voice stirs up the minds of dullards to intense supplication. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that the enunciation and the reverence of the chanter adds greatly to the fervour of those who stand by. Moreover the exhortation of a perfect man, and a spiritual conference has often raised the affections of those present to the richest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> too that by the death of a brother or some one dear to us, we are no less carried away to full conviction. The recollection also of our coldness and carelessness has sometimes aroused in us a healthful fervour of spirit. And in this way no one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that numberless opportunities are not wanting, by which through God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the coldness and sleepiness of our minds can be shaken off.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

<p><strong>Of the different sorts of conviction.</strong></p>

<p>But how and in what way those very convictions are produced from the inmost recesses of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> it is no less difficult to trace out. For often through some inexpressible delight and keenness of spirit the fruit of a most salutary conviction arises so that it actually breaks forth into shouts owing to the greatness of its incontrollable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; and the delight of the heart and greatness of exultation makes itself heard even in the cell of a neighbour. But sometimes the mind hides itself in complete silence within the secrets of a profound quiet, so that the amazement of a sudden illumination chokes all sounds of words and the overawed spirit either keeps all its feelings to itself or loses  them and pours forth its desires to God with groanings that cannot be uttered. But sometimes it is filled with such overwhelming conviction and grief that it cannot express it except by floods of tears.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<p><strong>A question about the fact that a plentiful supply of tears is not in our own power.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: My own poor self indeed is not altogether <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this feeling of conviction. For often when tears arise at the recollection of my faults, I have been by the Lord's visitation so refreshed by this ineffable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which you describe that the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> has assured me that I ought not to despair of their forgiveness. Than which state of mind I think there is nothing more sublime if only it could be recalled at our own will. For sometimes when I am desirous to stir myself up with all my power to the same conviction and tears, and place before my eyes all my faults and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, I am unable to bring back that copiousness of tears, and so my eyes are dry and hard like some hardest flint, so that not a single tear trickles from them. And so in proportion as I congratulate myself on that copiousness of tears, just so do I mourn that I cannot bring it back again whenever I wish.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>

<p><strong>The answer on the varieties of conviction which spring from tears.</strong></p>

<p>Isaac: Not every kind of shedding of tears is produced by one feeling or one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For in one way does that weeping originate which is caused by the pricks of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> smiting our heart, of which we read: <q>I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed; I will water my couch with my tears.</q>  And again: <q>Let tears run down like a torrent day and night: give yourself no rest, and let not the apple of your eye cease.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351621"><a href="../bible/lam002.htm#verse18">Lamentations&nbsp;2:18</a></span> In another, that which arises from the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things and the desire of that future <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, owing to which even richer well-springs of tears burst forth from uncontrollable delights and boundless exultation, while our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is thirsty for the mighty Living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, <q>When shall I come and appear before the presence of God? My tears have been my meat day and night,</q>  declaring with daily crying and lamentation: <q>Woe is me that my sojourning is prolonged;</q> and: <q>Too long has my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> been a sojourner.</q>  In another way do the tears flow forth, which without any <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of deadly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet still proceed from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and the recollection of that terrible judgment, with the terror of which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was smitten and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: <q>Enter not into judgment with Your servant, for in Your sight shall no man living be justified.</q>  There is too another kind of tears, which are caused not by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of one's self but by the hardness and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others; whereby Samuel is described as having wept for Saul, and both the Lord in the gospel and Jeremiah in former days for the city of Jerusalem, the latter thus saying: <q>Oh, that my head were water and my eyes a fountain of tears! And I will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351625"><a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse1">Jeremiah&nbsp;9:1</a></span> Or also such as were those tears of which we hear in the hundred and first Psalm: <q>For I have eaten ashes for my bread, and mingled my cup with weeping.</q>  And these were certainty not caused by the same feeling as those which arise in the sixth Psalm from the person of the penitent, but were due to the anxieties of this life and its distresses and losses, by which the righteous who are living in this world are oppressed. And this is clearly shown not only by the words of the Psalm itself, but also by its title, which runs as follows in the character of that poor person of whom it is said in the gospel that <q>blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351627"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;5:3</a></span> <q>A <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the poor when he was in distress and poured forth his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>

<p><strong>How tears ought not to be squeezed out, when they do not flow spontaneously.</strong></p>

<p>From these tears those are vastly different which are squeezed out from dry eyes while the heart is hard: and although we cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that these are altogether fruitless (for the attempt to shed them is made with a good intention, especially by those who have not yet been able to attain to perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or to be thoroughly cleansed from the stains of past or present <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>), yet certainly the flow of tears ought not to be thus forced out by those who have already advanced to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, nor should the weeping of the outward man be with great labour attempted, as even if it is produced it will never attain the rich copiousness of spontaneous tears. For it will rather cast down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the suppliant by his endeavours, and humiliate him, and plunge him in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs and draw him away from the celestial heights, wherein the awed mind of one who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> should be steadfastly fixed, and will force it to relax its hold on its <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and grow sick from barren and forced tears.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>

<p><strong>The opinion of Abbot Antony on the condition of prayer.</strong></p>

<p>And that you may see the character of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> I will give you not my own opinion but that of the blessed Antony: whom we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> sometimes to have been so persistent in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that often as he was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in a transport of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, when the sunrise began to appear, we have heard him in the fervour of his spirit declaiming: Why do you hinder me, O sun, who art arising for this very purpose; viz., to withdraw me from the brightness of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light? And his also is this heavenly and more than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> utterance on the end of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: That is not, said he, a perfect <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, wherein a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> understands himself and the words which he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>. And if we too, as far as our slender ability allows, may venture to add anything to this splendid utterance, we will bring forward the marks of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which are heard from the Lord, as far as we have tried them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>

<p><strong>Of the proof of prayer being heard.</strong></p>

<p>When, while we are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, no hesitation intervenes and breaks down the confidence of our petition by a sort of despair, but we feel that by pouring forth our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> we have obtained what we are asking for, we have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> have effectually reached God. For so far will one be heard and obtain an answer, as he believes that he is regarded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that God can grant it. For this saying of our Lord cannot be retracted: <q>Whatsoever you ask when you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you shall receive, and they shall come to you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351629"><a href="../bible/mar011.htm#verse24">Mark&nbsp;11:24</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 33</h2>

<p><strong>An objection that the confidence of being thus heard as described belongs only to saints.</strong></p>

<p>Germanus: We certainly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this confidence of being heard flows from purity of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, but for us, whose heart is still smitten by the pricks of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, how can we have it, as we have no merits to plead for us, whereby we might confidently presume that our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> would be heard?</p>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>

<p><strong>Answer on the different reasons for prayer being heard.</strong></p>

<p>Isaac: That there are different reasons for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> being heard in accordance with the varied and changing condition of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> teach us. For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord's words in the case of the agreement of two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; as it is said: <q>If two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351630"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;18:19</a></span> You have another in the fullness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. <q>For,</q> He says, <q>if you have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say unto this mountain: Be removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be impossible to you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351631"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;17:19</a></span> You have it in continuance in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which the Lord's words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance in petitioning, importunity: <q>For, verily, I say unto you that if not because of his friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351632"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;11:8</a></span> You have it in the fruits of almsgiving: <q>Shut up <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> in the heart of the poor and it shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you in the time of tribulation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351633"><a href="../bible/sir029.htm#verse15">Sirach&nbsp;29:15</a></span> You have it in the purifying of life and in works of mercy, as it is said: <q>Loose the bands of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, undo the bundles that oppress;</q> and after a few words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, <q>then,</q> he says, <q>you shall call and the Lord shall hear you; you shall cry, and He shall say, Here am I.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351634"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;58:6,&nbsp;9</a></span> Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said: <q>When I was in trouble I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;</q>  and again: <q>Afflict not the stranger for if he cries unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful.</q>  You see then in how many ways the gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> for securing those things which are salutary and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For if in contemplating our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which we mentioned above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, nor that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> describes, surely we cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to persevere, and not to have the least <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that by continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked according to the mind of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He not only does not despise or reject the importunate, but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, <q>Ask and you shall receive: seek and you shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asks receives, and he that seeks finds, and to him that knocks it shall be opened;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351637"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;11:9-10</a></span> and again: <q>All things whatsoever you shall ask in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> believing you shall receive, and nothing shall be impossible to you.</q>  And therefore even if all the grounds for being heard which we have mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought from the Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though he was heard from the first day on which he began to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, he only obtained the result of his petition after one and twenty days.  Wherefore we also ought not to grow slack in the earnestness of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> we have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest perhaps the gift of the answer be in God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> delayed, or the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord's promise where He says: <q>All things, whatsoever you shall ask in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> believing, you shall receive.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351640"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;21:22</a></span> For it is well for us to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of this question is clearly solved: <q>This is,</q> he says, <q>the confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, He hears us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351641"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:16</a></span> He bids us then have a full and undoubting confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own advantage or for temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord's will. And we are also taught to put this into our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> by the Lord's Prayer, where we say <q>Your will be done,</q>&mdash; <em>Yours</em> not ours. For if we also remember these words of the Apostle that <q>we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351642"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;8:26</a></span> we shall see that we sometimes ask for things opposed to our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and that we are most providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us with greater right and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> who had been for his good allowed by the Lord's will to buffet him, might be removed, saying: <q>For which I besought the Lord thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you, for strength is made perfect in weakness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351643"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:8-9</a></span> And this feeling even our Lord expressed when He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in the character  of man which He had taken, that He might give us a form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> as other things also by His example; saying thus: <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as You will,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351645"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;26:39</a></span> though certainly His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> was not discordant with His Father's will, <q>For He had come to save what was lost and to give His life a ransom for many;</q>  as He Himself says: <q>No man takes my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351647"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;10:18</a></span> In which character there is in the thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father: <q>To do Your will: O My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I am willing.</q>  For even if we read of the Father: <q>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351649"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:16</a></span> we find none the less of the Son: <q>Who gave Himself for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351650"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;1:4</a></span> And as it is said of the One: <q>Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for all of us,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351651"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;8:32</a></span> so it is written of the other: <q>He was offered because He Himself willed it.</q>  And it is shown that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in the actual <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Lord's resurrection we are taught that there was no discord of operation. For just as the blessed Apostle declares that the Father brought about the resurrection of His body, saying: <q>And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who raised Him from the dead,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351653"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;1:1</a></span> so also the Son testifies that He Himself will raise again the Temple of His body, saying: <q>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351654"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> And therefore we being instructed by all these examples of our Lord which have been enumerated ought to end our supplications also with the same <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and always to subjoin this clause to all our petitions: <q>Nevertheless not as I will, but as You will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351655"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;26:39</a></span> But it is clear enough that one who does not  <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with attention of mind cannot observe that threefold reverence  which is usually practised in the assemblies of the brethren at the close of service.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35</h2>

<p><strong>Of prayer to be offered within the chamber and with the door shut.</strong></p>

<p>Before all things however we ought most carefully to observe the Evangelic precept, which tells us to enter into our chamber and shut the door and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to our Father, which may be fulfilled by us as follows: We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> within our chamber, when removing our hearts inwardly from the din of all thoughts and anxieties, we disclose our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in secret and in closest intercourse to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with closed doors when with closed lips and complete silence we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the searcher not of words but of hearts. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in secret when from the heart and fervent mind we disclose our petitions to God alone, so that no hostile powers are even able to discover the character of our petition. Wherefore we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in complete silence, not only to avoid distracting the brethren standing near by our whispers or louder utterances, and disturbing the thoughts of those who are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, but also that the purport of our petition may be concealed from our enemies who are especially on the watch against us while we are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>. For so we shall fulfil this injunction: <q>Keep the doors of your mouth from her who sleeps in your bosom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note351658"><a href="../bible/mic007.htm#verse5">Micah&nbsp;7:5</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 36</h2>

<p><strong>Of the value of short and silent prayer.</strong></p>

<p>Wherefore we ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> often but briefly, lest if we are long about it our crafty foe may succeed in implanting something in our heart. For that is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, as <q>the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of God is a broken spirit.</q> This is the salutary offering, these are pure drink offerings, that is the <q><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of righteousness,</q> the <q><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise,</q> these are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and fat victims, <q><a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> full of marrow,</q> which are offered by contrite and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> hearts, and which those who practise this control and fervour of spirit, of which we have spoken, with effectual power can sing: <q>Let my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be set forth in Your sight as the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>: let the lifting up of my hands be an evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</q>  But the approach of the right hour and of night warns us that we ought with fitting devotion to do this very thing, of which, as our slender ability allowed, we seem to have propounded a great deal, and to have prolonged our conference considerably, though we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we have discoursed very little when the magnificence and difficulty of the subject are taken into account.</p>

<p>With these words of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Isaac we were dazzled rather than satisfied, and after evening service had been held, rested our limbs for a short time, and intending at the first dawn again to return under promise of a fuller discussion departed, rejoicing over the acquisition of these precepts as well as over the assurance of his promises. Since we felt that though the excellence of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> had been shown to us, still we had not yet understood from his discourse its nature, and the power by which continuance in it might be gained and kept.</p>
