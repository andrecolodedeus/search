<h1>Contra Celsus, Book I</h1>

<h2>Preface.</h2>

<p>1. When false witnesses testified against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a>, He remained silent; and when unfounded charges were brought against Him, He returned no answer, believing that His whole life and conduct among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were a better refutation than any answer to the false testimony, or than any formal defence against the accusations. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, my <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Ambrosius,  why you wished me to write a reply to the false charges brought by <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and to his accusations directed against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Churches in his treatise; as if the facts themselves did not furnish a manifest refutation, and the doctrine a better answer than any writing, seeing it both disposes of the false statements, and does not leave to the accusations any credibility or validity. Now, with respect to our Lord's silence when false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> was borne against Him, it is sufficient at present to quote the words of Matthew, for the testimony of Mark is to the same effect. And the words of Matthew are as follow: <q>And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and the council sought false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against Jesus to put Him to death, but found none, although many false witnesses came forward. At last two false witnesses came and said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and after three days to build it up. And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> arose, and said to Him, Do you answer nothing to what these <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against you? But Jesus held His peace.</q>  And that He returned no answer when <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accused, the following is the statement: <q>And Jesus stood before the governor; and he asked Him, saying, Are You the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? And Jesus said to him, You say. And when He was accused of the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and elders, He answered nothing. Then said <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> unto Him, Do you not hear how many things they <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against You? And He answered him to never a word, insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</q> </p>

<p>2. It was, indeed, matter of surprise to men even of ordinary intelligence, that one who was accused and assailed by false testimony, but who was able to defend Himself, and to show that He was guilty of none of the charges (alleged), and who might have enumerated the praiseworthy <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of His own life, and His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought by divine power, so as to give the judge an opportunity of delivering a more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> judgment regarding Him, should not have done this, but should have disdained such a procedure, and in the nobleness of His nature have contemned His accusers.  That the judge would, without any hesitation, have set Him at liberty if He had offered a defence, is clear from what is related of him when he said, <q>Which of the two do you wish that I should release unto you, Barabbas or Jesus, who is called Christ?</q>  and from what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> adds, <q>For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that for <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> they had delivered Him.</q>  Jesus, however, is at all times assailed by false witnesses, and, while <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> remains in the world, is ever exposed to accusation. And yet even now He continues silent before these things, and makes no audible answer, but places His defence in the lives of His genuine <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, which are a pre-eminent testimony, and one that rises superior to all false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and refutes and overthrows all unfounded accusations and charges.</p>

<p>3. I venture, then, to say that this <q>apology</q> which you require me to compose will somewhat weaken that defence (of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>) which rests on facts, and that power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> which is manifest to those who are not altogether devoid of perception. Notwithstanding, that we may not have the appearance of being reluctant to undertake the task which you have enjoined, we have endeavoured, to the best of our ability, to suggest, by way of answer to each of the statements advanced by <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a>, what seemed to us adapted to refute them, although his arguments have no power to shake the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of any (<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>) believer. And forbid, indeed, that any one should be found who, after having been a partaker in such a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God as was (displayed) in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, could be shaken in his purpose by the arguments of <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a>, or of any such as he. For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when enumerating the innumerable causes which generally separate men from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ and from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Christ Jesus (to all of which, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that was in himself rose superior), did not set down argument among the grounds of separation. For observe that he says, firstly: <q>Who shall separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (as it is written, For Your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.) Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us.</q>  And secondly, when laying down another series of causes which naturally tend to separate those who are not firmly grounded in their religion, he says: <q>For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>.</q> </p>

<p>4. Now, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, it is proper that <em>we</em> should feel elated because afflictions, or those other causes enumerated by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, do not separate us (from Christ); but not that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and any other resembling them, (should entertain that feeling), because they were far exalted above such things when they said, <q>In all these things we are <em>more</em> than conquerors through Him that loved us,</q>  which is a stronger statement than that they are simply <q>conquerors.</q> But if it be proper for <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to entertain a feeling of elation in not being separated from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, that feeling will be entertained by them, because neither death, nor life, nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, nor principalities, nor any of the things that follow, can separate them from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>. And therefore I do not congratulate that believer in Christ whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be shaken by <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a>&mdash; who no longer shares the common life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but has long since departed&mdash; or by any apparent plausibility of argument.  For I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what rank to place him who has need of arguments written in books in answer to the charges of <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, in order to prevent him from being shaken in his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and confirm him in it. But nevertheless, since in the multitude of those who are considered <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> some such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> might be found as would have their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shaken and overthrown by the writings of <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a>, but who might be preserved by a reply to them of such a nature as to refute his statements and to exhibit the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we have deemed it right to yield to your injunction, and to furnish an answer to the treatise which you sent us, but which I do not think that any one, although only a short way advanced in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, will allow to be a <q>True Discourse,</q> as <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a> has entitled it.</p>

<p>5. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, indeed, observing that there are in Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> certain things not to be lightly esteemed, which are plausible in the eyes of the many, but which represent <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, says with regard to such: <q>Beware lest any man spoil you through <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit, after the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.</q>  And seeing that there was a kind of greatness manifest in the words of the world's wisdom, he said that the words of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were <q>according to the rudiments of the world.</q> No man of sense, however, would say that those of Celsus were <q>according to the rudiments of the world.</q> Now those words, which contained some element of deceitfulness, the apostle named <q>vain deceit,</q> probably by way of distinction from a deceit that was not <q>vain;</q> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah observing this, ventured to say to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>O Lord, You have deceived me, and I was deceived; You are stronger than I, and hast prevailed.</q>  But in the language of Celsus there seems to me to be no deceitfulness at all, not even that which is <q>vain;</q> such deceitfulness, viz., as is found in the language of those who have founded <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, and who have been endowed with no ordinary talent for such pursuits. And as no one would say that any ordinary <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in geometrical demonstrations was intended to deceive, or would describe it for the sake of exercise in such matters;  so those opinions which are to be styled <q>vain deceit,</q> and the <q>tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> and <q>according to the rudiments of the world,</q> must have some resemblance to the views of those who have been the founders of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, (if such titles are to be appropriately applied to them).</p>

<p>6. After proceeding with this work as far as the place where Celsus introduces the Jew disputing with Jesus, I resolved to prefix this preface to the beginning (of the treatise), in order that the reader of our reply to Celsus might fall in with it first, and see that this book has been composed not for those who are thorough <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, but for such as are either wholly unacquainted with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or for those who, as the apostle terms them, are <q>weak in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</q> regarding whom he says, <q>Receive him that is weak in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  And this preface must be my apology for beginning my answer to Celsus on one plan, and carrying it on on another. For my first intention was to indicate his principal objections, and then briefly the answers that were returned to them, and subsequently to make a systematic treatise of the whole discourse.  But afterwards, circumstances themselves suggested to me that I should be economical of my time, and that, satisfied with what I had already stated at the commencement, I should in the following part grapple closely, to the best of my ability, with the charges of Celsus. I have therefore to ask indulgence for those portions which follow the preface towards the beginning of the book. And if you are not impressed by the powerful arguments which succeed, then, asking similar indulgence also with respect to them, I refer you, if you still desire an argumentative solution of the objections of Celsus, to those men who are wiser than myself, and who are able by words and treatises to overthrow the charges which he brings against us. But better is the man who, although meeting with the work of Celsus, needs no answer to it at all, but who despises all its contents, since they are contemned, and with good reason, by every believer in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, through the Spirit that is in him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>The first point which Celsus brings forward, in his desire to throw discredit upon <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, is, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> entered into secret associations with each other contrary to law, saying, that <q>of associations some are public, and that these are in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; others, again, secret, and maintained in violation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.</q> And his wish is to bring into disrepute what are termed the <q><a href="../cathen/01200b.htm">love-feasts</a></q>  of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, as if they had their origin in the common danger, and were more binding than any oaths. Since, then, he babbles about the public law, alleging that the associations of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are in violation of it, we have to reply, that if a man were placed among Scythians, whose <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a>,  and having no opportunity of escape, were compelled to live among them, such an one would with good reason, for the sake of the law of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which the Scythians would regard as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>,  enter into associations contrary to their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, with those like-minded with himself; so, if <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is to decide, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> which relate to images, and an <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistical</a> <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, are <q>Scythian</q> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, or more impious even than these, if there be any such. It is not irrational, then, to form associations in opposition to existing <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, if done for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For as those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> would do well who should enter into a secret association in order to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> a tyrant who had seized upon the liberties of a state, so <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> also, when tyrannized over by him who is called the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, form leagues contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, against his power, and for the safety of those others whom they may succeed in persuading to revolt from a government which is, as it were, <q>Scythian,</q> and despotic.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>Celsus next proceeds to say, that the system of doctrine, viz., <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, upon which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> depends, was barbarous in its origin. And with an appearance of fairness, he does not reproach <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>  because of its origin among barbarians, but gives the latter credit for their ability in discovering (such) doctrines. To this, however, he adds the statement, that the Greeks are more skilful than any others in judging, establishing, and reducing to practice the discoveries of barbarous nations. Now this is our answer to his allegations, and our defence of the truths contained in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, that if any one were to come from the study of Grecian opinions and usages to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, he would not only decide that its doctrines were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but would by practice establish their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and supply whatever seemed wanting, from a Grecian point of view, to their demonstration, and thus confirm the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. We have to say, moreover, that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has a demonstration of its own, more divine than any established by Grecian dialectics. And this diviner method is called by the apostle the <q>manifestation of the Spirit and of power:</q> of <q>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,</q> on account of the prophecies, which are sufficient to produce <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in any one who reads them, especially in those things which relate to Christ; and of <q>power,</q> because of the signs and wonders which we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to have been performed, both on many other grounds, and on this, that traces of them are still preserved among those who regulate their lives by the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>After this, Celsus proceeding to speak of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> teaching and practising their favourite doctrines in secret, and saying that they do this to some purpose, seeing they escape the penalty of death which is imminent, he compares their dangers with those which were encountered by such men as Socrates for the sake of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; and here he might have mentioned Pythagoras as well, and other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. But our answer to this is, that in the case of Socrates the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> immediately afterwards repented; and no feeling of bitterness remained in their minds regarding him, as also happened in the history of Pythagoras. The followers of the latter, indeed, for a considerable time established their schools in that part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> called Magna Gr&aelig;cia; but in the case of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the Roman Senate, and the princes of the time, and the soldiery, and the people, and the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> of those who had become converts to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon their doctrine, and would have prevented (its progress), overcoming it by a confederacy of so powerful a nature, had it not, by the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, escaped the danger, and risen above it, so as (finally) to defeat the whole world in its conspiracy against it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>Let us notice also how he thinks to cast discredit upon our system of morals,  alleging that it is only common to us with other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and no venerable or new branch of instruction. In reply to which we have to say, that unless all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> had naturally impressed upon their minds sound ideas of morality, the doctrine of the punishment of sinners would have been excluded by those who bring upon themselves the righteous judgments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is not therefore matter of surprise that the same God should have sown in the hearts of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> those truths which He taught by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, in order that at the divine judgment every man may be without excuse, having the <q>requirements  of the law written upon his heart,</q>&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> obscurely alluded to by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>  in what the Greeks regard as a myth, where it represents God as having with His own finger written down the commandments, and given them to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the worshippers of the calf made him break in pieces, as if the flood of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, so to speak, had swept them away. But <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> having again hewn tables of stone, God wrote the commandments a second time, and gave them to him; the prophetic word preparing the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as it were, after the first transgression, for the writing of God a second time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>Treating of the regulations respecting <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> as being peculiar to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, Celsus establishes their correctness, saying that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do not consider those to be gods that are made with hands, on the ground that it is not in conformity with right reason (to suppose) that images, fashioned by the most worthless and depraved of workmen, and in many instances also provided by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, can be (regarded as) gods. In what follows, however, wishing to show that this is a common opinion, and one not first discovered by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, he quotes a saying of Heraclitus to this effect: <q>That those who draw near to lifeless images, as if they were gods, act in a similar manner to those who would enter into conversation with houses.</q> Respecting this, then, we have to say, that ideas were implanted in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> like the principles of morality, from which not only Heraclitus, but any other Greek or barbarian, might by reflection have deduced the same conclusion; for he states that the Persians also were of the same opinion, quoting Herodotus as his authority. We also can add to these Zeno of Citium, who in his <em>Polity</em>, says: <q>And there will be no need to build temples, for nothing ought to be regarded as sacred, or of much value, or <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, which is the work of builders and of mean men.</q> It is evident, then, with respect to this opinion (as well as others), that there has been engraven upon the hearts of men by the finger of God a sense of the duty that is required.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>After this, through the influence of some motive which is unknown to me, Celsus asserts that it is by the names of certain <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and by the use of incantations, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> appear to be possessed of (miraculous) power; hinting, I suppose, at the practices of those who expel <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> by incantations. And here he manifestly appears to malign the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For it is not by incantations that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> seem to prevail (over <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>), but by the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, accompanied by the announcement of the narratives which relate to Him; for the repetition of these has frequently been the means of driving <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> out of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, especially when those who repeated them did so in a sound and genuinely believing spirit. Such power, indeed, does the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> possess over <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, that there have been instances where it was effectual, when it was pronounced even by bad men, which Jesus Himself taught (would be the case), when He said: <q>Many shall say to Me in that day, In Your name we have cast out devils, and done many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>.</q>  Whether Celsus omitted this from intentional malignity, or from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. And he next proceeds to bring a charge against the Saviour Himself, alleging that it was by means of sorcery that He was able to accomplish the wonders which He performed; and that foreseeing that others would attain the same <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and do the same things, making a boast of doing them by help of the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He excludes such from His kingdom. And his accusation is, that if they are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> excluded, while He Himself is guilty of the same practices, He is a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man; but if He is not guilty of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in doing such things, neither are they who do the same as He. But even if it be impossible to show by what power Jesus wrought these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, it is clear that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> employ no spells or incantations, but the simple name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and certain other words in which they repose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>Moreover, since he frequently calls the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine a secret system (of belief), we must confute him on this point also, since almost the entire world is better acquainted with what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> preach than with the favourite opinions of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. For who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the statement that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and that He was crucified, and that His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> is an article of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among many, and that a general judgment is announced to come, in which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are to be punished according to their deserts, and the righteous to be duly rewarded? And yet the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the resurrection, not being understood,  is made a subject of ridicule among unbelievers. In these circumstances, to speak of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine as a <em>secret</em> system, is altogether absurd. But that there should be certain doctrines, not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the multitude, which are (revealed) after the exoteric ones have been taught, is not a peculiarity of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> alone, but also of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> systems, in which certain truths are exoteric and others esoteric. Some of the hearers of Pythagoras were content with his <em>ipse dixit</em>; while others were taught in secret those doctrines which were not deemed fit to be communicated to profane and insufficiently prepared ears. Moreover, all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> that are celebrated everywhere throughout Greece and barbarous countries, although held in secret, have no discredit thrown upon them, so that it is in vain that he endeavours to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> the secret doctrines of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, seeing he does not correctly understand its nature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>It is with a certain eloquence,  indeed, that he appears to advocate the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of those who bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by their death, in the following words: <q>And I do not maintain that if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who has adopted a system of good doctrine, is to incur danger from men on that account, he should either <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>, or feign <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, or openly deny his opinions.</q> And he condemns those who, while holding the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> views, either pretend that they do not, or deny them, saying that <q>he who holds a certain opinion ought not to feign recantation, or publicly disown it.</q> And here Celsus must be convicted of self-contradiction. For from other treatises of his it is ascertained that he was an Epicurean; but here, because he thought that he could assail <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with better effect by not professing the opinions of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, he pretends that there is a something better in man than the earthly part of his nature, which is akin to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and says that <q>they in whom this element, viz., the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is in a healthy condition, are ever seeking after their kindred nature, meaning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are ever desiring to hear something about Him, and to call it to remembrance.</q> Observe now the insincerity of his character! Having said a little before, that <q>the man who had embraced a system of good doctrine ought not, even if exposed to danger on that account from men, to disavow it, or pretend that he had done so, nor yet openly disown it,</q> he now involves himself in all manner of contradictions. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that if he acknowledged himself an Epicurean, he would not obtain any credit when accusing those who, in any degree, introduce the doctrine of Providence, and who place a God over the world. And we have heard that there were two individuals of the name of Celsus, both of whom were <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>; the earlier of the two having lived in the time of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, but this one in that of Adrian, and later.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>He next proceeds to recommend, that in adopting opinions we should follow reason and a rational guide,  since he who assents to opinions without following this course is very liable to be deceived. And he compares inconsiderate <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> to Metragyrt&aelig;, and soothsayers, and Mithr&aelig;, and Sabbadians, and to anything else that one may fall in with, and to the phantoms of Hecate, or any other <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For as among such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are frequently to be found <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, who, taking advantage of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of those who are easily deceived, lead them away whither they will, so also, he says, is the case among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. And he asserts that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who do not wish either to give or receive a reason for their belief, keep repeating, <q>Do not examine, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>!</q> and, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will save you!</q> And he alleges that such also say, <q>The wisdom of this life is bad, but that foolishness is a good thing!</q> To which we have to answer, that if it were possible for all to leave the business of life, and devote themselves to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, no other method ought to be adopted by any one, but this alone. For in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> system also it will be found that there is, not to speak at all arrogantly, at least as much of investigation into articles of belief, and of explanation of dark sayings, occurring in the prophetical writings, and of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and of countless other things, which either were narrated or enacted with a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> signification,  (as is the case with other systems). But since the course alluded to is impossible, partly on account of the necessities of life, partly on account of the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as only a very few individuals devote themselves earnestly to study,  what better method could be devised with a view of assisting the multitude, than that which was delivered by Jesus to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>? And let us inquire, with respect to the great multitude of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, who have washed away the mire of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in which they formerly wallowed, whether it were better for them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> without a reason, and (so) to have become reformed and improved in their habits, through the belief that men are chastised for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and honoured for good works or not to have allowed themselves to be converted on the strength of mere <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but (to have waited) until they could give themselves to a thorough examination of the (necessary) reasons. For it is manifest that, (on such a plan), all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, with very few exceptions, would not obtain this (amelioration of conduct) which they have obtained through a simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but would continue to remain in the practice of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> life. Now, whatever other evidence can be furnished of the fact, that it was not without divine intervention that the philanthropic scheme of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, this also must be added. For a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that even a physician of the body, who restores the sick to better health, could take up his abode in any city or country without divine permission, since no good happens to men without the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And if he who has cured the <em>bodies</em> of many, or restored them to better health, does not effect his cures without the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how much more He who has healed the <em><a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a></em> of many, and has turned them (to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>), and improved their nature, and attached them to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is over all things, and taught them to refer every action to His good pleasure, and to shun all that is displeasing to Him, even to the least of their words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, or even of the thoughts of their hearts?</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>In the next place, since our opponents keep repeating those statements about <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we must say that, considering it as a useful thing for the multitude, we admit that we teach those men to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> without reasons, who are unable to abandon all other employments, and give themselves to an examination of arguments; and our opponents, although they do not acknowledge it, yet practically do the same. For who is there that, on betaking himself to the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and throwing himself into the ranks of some <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, either by chance,  or because he is provided with a teacher of that school, adopts such a course for any other reason, except that he <em>believes</em> his particular <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> to be superior to any other? For, not waiting to hear the arguments of all the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and of all the different <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, and the reasons for condemning one system and for supporting another, he in this way elects to become a Stoic, e.g., or a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a>, or a Peripatetic, or an Epicurean, or a follower of some other school, and is thus borne, although they will not admit it, by a kind of irrational impulse to the practice, say of Stoicism, to the disregard of the others; despising either Platonism, as being marked by greater humility than the others; or Peripateticism, as more <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and as admitting with more fairness  than other systems the blessings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. And some also, alarmed at first sight  about the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, from seeing what happens in the world to the vicious and to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, have rashly concluded that there is no <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> at all, and have adopted the views of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> and Celsus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>Since, then, as reason teaches, we must repose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in some one of those who have been the introducers of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> among the Greeks or Barbarians, why should we not rather <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God who is over all things, and in Him who teaches that worship is due to God alone, and that other things are to be passed by, either as non-existent, or as existing indeed, and worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but not of worship and reverence? And respecting these things, he who not only believes, but who contemplates things with the eye of reason, will state the demonstrations that occur to him, and which are the result of careful investigation. And why should it not be more reasonable, seeing all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things are dependent upon <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> God rather than them? For who enters on a voyage, or contracts a marriage, or becomes the father of children, or casts seed into the ground, without believing that better things will result from so doing, although the contrary might and sometimes does happen? And yet the belief that better things, even agreeably to their wishes, will follow, makes all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> venture upon uncertain enterprises, which may turn out differently from what they expect. And if the hope and belief of a better future be the support of life in every uncertain enterprise, why shall not this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rather be rationally accepted by him who believes on better grounds than he who sails the sea, or tills the ground, or marries a wife, or engages in any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> pursuit, in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a God who was the Creator of all these things, and in Him who with surpassing wisdom and divine greatness of mind dared to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> this doctrine to men in every part of the world, at the cost of great danger, and of a death considered <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>, which He underwent for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; having also taught those who were persuaded to embrace His doctrine at the first, to proceed, under the peril of every danger, and of ever impending death, to all quarters of the world to ensure the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men?</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>In the next place, when Celsus says in express words, <q>If they would answer me, not as if I were asking for information, for I am acquainted with all their opinions, but because I take an equal interest in them all, it would be well. And if they will not, but will keep reiterating, as they generally do, 'Do not investigate,' etc., they must,</q> he continues, <q>explain to me at least of what nature these things are of which they speak, and whence they are derived,</q> etc. Now, with regard to his statement that he <q>is acquainted with all our doctrines,</q> we have to say that this is a boastful and daring assertion; for if he had read the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in particular, which are full of acknowledged difficulties, and of declarations that are obscure to the multitude, and if he had perused the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and the other writings of the law and of the Jewish history, and the utterances of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and had read them candidly, with a desire to enter into their meaning, he would not have expressed himself with such boldness, nor said that he <q>was acquainted with all their doctrines.</q> Even we ourselves, who have devoted much study to these writings, would not say that <q>we were acquainted with everything,</q> for we have a regard for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Not one of us will assert, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>,</q> or will be confident that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all those of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the fact that so many differences of opinion exist among the expositors of these systems. For who is so daring as to say that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all the opinions of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> or of the Peripatetics? Unless, indeed, it should be the case that he has heard this boast, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them all,</q> from some <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and senseless individuals, who do not perceive their own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and should thus <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, from having had such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as his teachers, that he was acquainted with them all. Such an one appears to me to act very much as a person would do who had visited <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (where the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <em>savans</em>, learned in their country's literature, are greatly given to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a> about those things which are regarded among them as divine, but where the vulgar, hearing certain myths, the reasons of which they do not understand, are greatly elated because of their fancied <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>), and who should <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that he is acquainted with the whole circle of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, after having been a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> alone, and without having associated with any of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or having learned the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Egyptians from any other source. And what I have said regarding the learned and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> among the Egyptians, I might have said also of the Persians; among whom there are <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, conducted on rational principles by the learned among them, but understood in a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> sense by the more superficial of the multitude.  And the same remark applies to the Syrians, and Indians, and to all those who have a literature and a mythology.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>But since Celsus has declared it to be a saying of many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that <q>the wisdom of this life is a bad thing, but that foolishness is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</q> we have to answer that he <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, not giving the words as they actually occur in the writings of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, where they run as follow: <q>If any one among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  The apostle, therefore, does not say simply that <q>wisdom is foolishness  with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> but <q>the wisdom of <em>this world</em>.</q> And again, not, <q>If any one among you seems to be wise, let him become a fool universally;</q> but, <q>let him become a fool <em>in this world</em>, that he may become wise.</q> We term, then, <q>the wisdom of this world,</q> every false system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, is brought to nought; and we call foolishness good, not without restriction, but when a man becomes foolish as to <em>this world</em>. As if we were to say that the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a>, who believes in the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and in the doctrine of its <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a>,  incurs the charge of folly with the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who discard this opinion; and with the Peripatetics, who babble about the subtleties of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>; and with the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, who call it <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> to introduce a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and to place a God over all things. Moreover, that it is in agreement with the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, of much more importance to give our assent to doctrines upon grounds of reason and wisdom than on that of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> merely, and that it was only in certain circumstances that the latter course was desired by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, in order not to leave men altogether without help, is shown by that genuine <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when he says: <q>For after that, in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the world by wisdom <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q>  Now by these words it is clearly shown that it is by the wisdom of God that God ought to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But as this result did not follow, it pleased God a second time to save them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, not by <q>folly</q> <em>universally</em>, but by such foolishness as depended on preaching. For the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> as crucified is the <q>foolishness</q> of preaching, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also perceived, when he said, <q>But we preach Christ crucified, to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness; but to them who are called, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks, Christ the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>Celsus, being of opinion that there is to be found among many nations a general relationship of doctrine, enumerates all the nations which gave rise to such and such opinions; but for some reason, unknown to me, he casts a slight upon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, not including them among the others, as having either laboured along with them, and arrived at the same conclusions, or as having entertained similar opinions on many subjects. It is proper, therefore, to ask him why he gives credence to the histories of Barbarians and Greeks respecting the antiquity of those nations of whom he speaks, but stamps the histories of this nation alone as false. For if the respective writers related the events which are found in these works in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, why should we distrust the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> alone? And if <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have recorded many things in their history from a desire to favour their own system, why should we not say the same of the historians of other countries? Or, when the Egyptians or their histories speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, are they to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on that point; but the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when saying the same things of the Egyptians, and declaring that they had suffered great <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> at their hands, and that on this account they had been punished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are to be charged with <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>? And this applies not to the Egyptians alone, but to others; for we shall find that there was a connection between the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and that this is recorded in the ancient histories of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>. And so also the Jewish historians (I avoid using the word <q><a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,</q> that I may not appear to prejudge the case) have related that the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> were enemies of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Observe at once, then, the arbitrary procedure of this individual, who believes the histories of these nations on the ground of their being learned, and condemns others as being wholly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. For listen to the statement of Celsus: <q>There is,</q> he says, <q>an authoritative account from the very beginning, respecting which there is a constant agreement among all the most learned nations, and cities, and men.</q> And yet he will not call the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a learned nation in the same way in which he does the Egyptians, and <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and Indians, and Persians, and Odrysians, and Samothracians, and Eleusinians.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>How much more impartial than Celsus is Numenius the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a>, who has given many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of being a very eloquent man, and who has carefully tested many opinions, and collected together from many sources what had the appearance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for, in the first book of his treatise <em>On the Good</em>, speaking of those nations who have adopted the opinion that God is incorporeal, he enumerates the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also among those who hold this view; not showing any reluctance to use even the language of their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in his treatise, and to give it a metaphorical signification. It is said, moreover, that Hermippus has recorded in his first book, <em>On Lawgivers</em>, that it was from the Jewish people that Pythagoras derived the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which he introduced among the Greeks. And there is extant a work by the historian Hecat&aelig;us, treating  of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in which so high a character is bestowed upon that nation for its learning, that Herennius Philo, in his treatise on the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, has doubts in the first place, whether it is really the composition of the historian; and says, in the second place, that if really his, it is probable that he was carried away by the plausible nature of the Jewish history, and so yielded his assent to their system.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p>I must express my surprise that Celsus should class the Odrysians, and Samothracians, and Eleusinians, and Hyperboreans among the most ancient and learned nations, and should not deem the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> worthy of a place among such, either for their learning or their antiquity, although there are many treatises in circulation among the Egyptians, and Ph&oelig;nicians, and Greeks, which testify to their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as an ancient people, but which I have considered it unnecessary to quote. For any one who chooses may read what <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Flavius Josephus</a> has recorded in his two books, <em>On the Antiquity</em>  <em>of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em>, where he brings together a great collection of writers, who bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the antiquity of the Jewish people; and there exists the <em>Discourse to the Greeks</em> of <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> the younger,  in which with very great learning he enumerates those historians who have treated of the antiquity of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation and of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. It seems, then, to be not from a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but from a spirit of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, that Celsus makes these statements, his object being to asperse the origin of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, which is connected with <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>. Nay, he styles the Galactophagi of Homer, and the Druids of the Gauls, and the Get&aelig;, most learned and ancient tribes, on account of the resemblance between their traditions and those of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, although I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether any of their histories survive; but the Hebrews alone, as far as in him lies, he deprives of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> both of antiquity and learning. And again, when making a list of ancient and learned men who have conferred benefits upon their contemporaries (by their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>), and upon posterity by their writings, he excluded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> from the number; while of Linus, to whom Celsus assigns a foremost place in his list, there exists neither <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> nor discourses which produced a change for the better among any tribes; whereas a whole nation, dispersed throughout the entire world, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Consider, then, whether it is not from open malevolence that he has expelled <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> from his catalogue of learned men, while asserting that Linus, and Mus&aelig;us, and Orpheus, and Pherecydes, and the Persian Zoroaster, and Pythagoras, discussed these topics, and that their opinions were deposited in books, and have thus been preserved down to the present time. And it is intentionally also that he has omitted to take notice of the myth, embellished chiefly by Orpheus, in which the gods are described as affected by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weaknesses and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>In what follows, Celsus, assailing the Mosaic history, finds fault with those who give it a tropical and allegorical signification. And here one might say to this great man, who inscribed upon his own work the title of a <em>True Discourse</em>, <q>Why, good sir, do you make it a boast to have it recorded that the gods should engage in such adventures as are described by your learned poets and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and be guilty of abominable intrigues, and of engaging in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against their own fathers, and of cutting off their secret parts, and should dare to commit and to suffer such enormities; while <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who gives no such accounts respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor even regarding the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and who relates <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of far less atrocity regarding men (for in his writings no one ever ventured to commit such crimes as Kronos did against Uranus, or Zeus against his father, or that of the father of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and gods, who had intercourse with his own daughter), should be considered as having deceived those who were placed under his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and to have led them into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>?</q> And here Celsus seems to me to act somewhat as Thrasymachus the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> did, when he would not allow Socrates to answer regarding <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as he wished, but said, <q>Take care not to say that utility is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or duty, or anything of that kind.</q> For in like manner Celsus assails (as he thinks) the Mosaic histories, and finds fault with those who understand them allegorically, at the same time bestowing also some praise upon those who do so, to the effect that they are more impartial (than those who do not); and thus, as it were, he prevents by his cavils those who are able to show the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> state of the case from offering such a defence as they would wish to offer. </p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p>And challenging a comparison of book with book, I would say, <q>Come now, good sir, take down the poems of Linus, and of Mus&aelig;us, and of Orpheus, and the writings of Pherecydes, and carefully compare these with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>&mdash; histories with histories, and ethical discourses with <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and commandments&mdash; and see which of the two are the better fitted to change the character of the hearer on the very spot, and which to harden  him in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; and observe that your series of writers display little concern for those readers who are to peruse them at once unaided,  but have composed their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> (as you term it) for those who are able to comprehend its metaphorical and allegorical signification; whereas <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, like a distinguished orator who meditates some figure of Rhetoric, and who carefully introduces in every part language of twofold meaning, has done this in his five books: neither affording, in the portion which relates to morals, any handle to his Jewish subjects for committing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; nor yet giving to the few individuals who were endowed with greater wisdom, and who were capable of investigating his meaning, a treatise devoid of material for speculation. But of your learned poets the very writings would seem no longer to be preserved, although they would have been carefully treasured up if the readers had perceived any benefit (likely to be derived from them); whereas the works of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> have stirred up many, who were even aliens to the manners of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to the belief that, as these writings testify, the first who enacted these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and delivered them to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, was the God who was the Creator of the world. For it became the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, after laying down <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for its government, to confer upon His words a power which might subdue all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in every part of the earth.  And this I maintain, having as yet entered into no investigation regarding Jesus, but still demonstrating that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who is far inferior to the Lord, is, as the <em>Discourse</em> will show, greatly superior to your wise poets and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p>After these statements, Celsus, from a secret desire to cast discredit upon the Mosaic account of the creation, which teaches that the world is not yet ten thousand years old, but very much under that, while concealing his wish, intimates his agreement with those who hold that the world is uncreated. For, maintaining that there have been, from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, many conflagrations and many deluges, and that the flood which lately took place in the time of Deucalion is comparatively modern, he clearly demonstrates to those who are able to understand him, that, in his opinion, the world was uncreated. But let this assailant of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> tell us by what arguments he was compelled to accept the statement that there have been many conflagrations and many cataclysms, and that the flood which occurred in the time of Deucalion, and the conflagration in that of Ph&aelig;thon, were more recent than any others. And if he should put forward the dialogues of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> (as evidence) on these subjects, we shall say to him that it is allowable for us also to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there resided in the pure and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who ascended above all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, and united himself to the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and who made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> divine things with far greater clearness than <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, or those other wise men (who lived) among the Greeks and Romans, a spirit which was divine. And if he demands of us our reasons for such a belief, let him first give grounds for his own unsupported assertions, and then we shall show that this view of ours is the correct one.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p>And yet, against his will, Celsus is entangled into testifying that the world is comparatively modern, and not yet ten thousand years old, when he says that the Greeks consider those things as ancient, because, owing to the deluges and conflagrations, they have not beheld or received any memorials of older events. But let Celsus have, as his authorities for the myth regarding the conflagrations and inundations, those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who, in his opinion, are the most learned of the Egyptians, traces of whose wisdom are to be found in the worship of irrational animals, and in arguments which prove that such a worship of God is in conformity with reason, and of a secret and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> character. The Egyptians, then, when they boastfully give their own account of the divinity of animals, are to be considered wise; but if any Jew, who has signified his adherence to the law and the lawgiver, refer everything to the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he is, in the opinion of Celsus and those like him, deemed inferior to him who degrades the Divinity not only to the level of rational and mortal animals, but even to that of irrational also!&mdash; a view which goes far beyond the mythical doctrine of transmigration, according to which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> falls down from the summit of heaven, and enters into the body of brute beasts, both tame and savage! And if the Egyptians related fables of this kind, they are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to convey a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> meaning by their enigmas and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; but if <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> compose and leave behind him histories and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for an entire nation, they are to be considered as empty fables, the language of which admits of no allegorical meaning!</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p>The following is the view of Celsus and the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>: <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> having,</q> he says, <q>learned the doctrine which is to be found existing among wise nations and eloquent men, obtained the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of divinity.</q> Now, in answer to this we have to say, that it may be allowed him that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did indeed hear a somewhat ancient doctrine, and transmitted the same to the Hebrews; that if the doctrine which he heard was false, and neither <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> nor venerable, and if notwithstanding, he received it and handed it down to those under his authority, he is liable to censure; but if, as you assert, he gave his adherence to opinions that were wise and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> his people by means of them, what, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, has he done deserving of condemnation? Would, indeed, that not only <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, but Aristotle, whose sentiments regarding <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> are not so impious (as those of the former), and the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who assert that God is a body, had heard such a doctrine! Then the world would not have been filled with opinions which either disallow or enfeeble the action of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, or introduce a corrupt corporeal principle, according to which the god of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> is a body, with respect to whom they are not afraid to say that he is capable of change, and may be altered and transformed in all his parts, and, generally, that he is capable of corruption, if there be any one to corrupt him, but that he has the good fortune to escape corruption, because there is none to corrupt. Whereas the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, which preserves the immutability and unalterableness of the divine nature, is stigmatized as impious, because it does not partake of the profanity of those whose notions of God are marked by impiety, but because it says in the supplication addressed to the Divinity, <q>You are the same,</q>  it being, moreover, an article of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that God has said, <q>I change not.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p>After this, Celsus, without condemning <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> as practised by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, asserts that this usage was derived from the Egyptians; thus believing the Egyptians rather than <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who says that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was the first among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who practised the rite. And it is not <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> alone who mentions the name of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, assigning to him great intimacy with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but many also of those who give themselves to the practice of the conjuration of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, employ in their spells the expression <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,</q> pointing out by the very name the friendship (that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>) between that just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And yet, while making use of the phrase <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,</q> they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is! And the same remark applies to Isaac, and Jacob, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; which names, although confessedly Hebrew, are frequently introduced by those Egyptians who profess to produce some wonderful result by means of their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The rite of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, however, which began with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and was discontinued by Jesus, who desired that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should not practise it, is not before us for explanation; for the present occasion does not lead us to speak of such things, but to make an effort to refute the charges brought against the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by Celsus, who thinks that he will be able the more easily to establish the falsity of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, if, by assailing its origin in <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, he can show that the latter also is untrue.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p>After this, Celsus next asserts that <q>Those herdsmen and shepherds who followed <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> as their leader, had their minds deluded by vulgar deceits, and so supposed that there was one God.</q> Let him show, then, how, after this irrational departure, as he regards it, of the herdsmen and shepherds from the worship of many gods, he himself is able to establish the multiplicity of deities that are found among the Greeks, or among those other nations that are called Barbarian. Let him establish, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of Mnemosyne, the mother of the Muses by Zeus; or of Themis, the parent of the Hours; or let him prove that the ever naked Graces can have a real, substantial <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But he will not be able to show, from any actions of theirs, that these fictitious representations  of the Greeks, which have the appearance of being invested with bodies, are (really) gods. And why should the fables of the Greeks regarding the gods be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, any more than those of the Egyptians for example, who in their language <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of a Mnemosyne, mother of the nine Muses; nor of a Themis, parent of the Hours; nor of a Euphrosyne, one of the Graces; nor of any other of these names? How much more manifest (and how much better than all these inventions!) is it that, convinced by what we see, in the admirable order of the world, we should worship the Maker of it as the one Author of one effect, and which, as being wholly in harmony with itself, cannot on that account have been the work of many makers; and that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the whole heaven is not held together by the movements of many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, for one is enough, which bears the whole of the non-wandering  sphere from east to west, and embraces within it all things which the world requires, and which are not self-existing! For all are parts of the world, while God is no part of the whole. But God cannot be imperfect, as a part is imperfect. And perhaps profounder consideration will show, that as God is not a part, so neither is He properly the whole, since the whole is composed of parts; and reason will not allow us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the God who is over all is composed of parts, each one of which cannot do what all the other parts can.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p>After this he continues: <q>These herdsmen and shepherds concluded that there was but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, named either the Highest, or Adonai, or the Heavenly, or Sabaoth, or called by some other of those names which they delight to give this world; and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing beyond that.</q> And in a subsequent part of his work he says, that <q>It makes no difference whether the God who is over all things be called by the name of Zeus, which is current among the Greeks, or by that, e.g., which is in use among the Indians or Egyptians.</q> Now, in answer to this, we have to remark that this involves a deep and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> subject&mdash; that, viz., respecting the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of names: it being a question whether, as Aristotle thinks, names were bestowed by arrangement, or, as the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> hold, by nature; the first words being imitations of things, agreeably to which the names were formed, and in conformity with which they introduce certain principles of etymology; or whether, as <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> teaches (differing in this from the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>), names were given by nature,&mdash; the first men having uttered certain words varying with the circumstances in which they found themselves. If, then, we shall be able to establish, in reference to the preceding statement, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of powerful names, some of which are used by the learned among the Egyptians, or by the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> among the Persians, and by the Indian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> called Brahmans, or by the Saman&aelig;ans, and others in different countries; and shall be able to make out that the so-called magic is not, as the followers of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> and Aristotle suppose, an altogether uncertain thing, but is, as those skilled in it prove, a consistent system, having words which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to exceedingly few; then we say that the name Sabaoth, and Adonai, and the other names treated with so much reverence among the Hebrews, are not applicable to any ordinary <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, but belong to a secret theology which refers to the Framer of all things. These names, accordingly, when pronounced with that attendant train of circumstances which is appropriate to their nature, are possessed of great power; and other names, again, current in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> tongue, are efficacious against certain <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who can only do certain things; and other names in the Persian language have corresponding power over other spirits; and so on in every individual nation, for different purposes. And thus it will be found that, of the various <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> upon the earth, to whom different localities have been assigned, each one bears a name appropriate to the several dialects of place and country. He, therefore, who has a nobler idea, however small, of these matters, will be careful not to apply differing names to different things; lest he should resemble those who mistakenly apply the name of God to lifeless matter, or who drag down the title of <q>the Good</q> from the First Cause, or from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and excellence, and apply it to blind Plutus, and to a healthy and well-proportioned mixture of flesh and blood and bones, or to what is considered to be noble birth. </p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p>And perhaps there is a danger as great as that which degrades the name of <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> or of <q>the Good,</q> to improper objects, in changing the name of God according to a secret system, and applying those which belong to inferior beings to greater, and <em><a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> versa</em>. And I do not dwell on this, that when the name of Zeus is uttered, there is heard at the same time that of the son of Kronos and Rhea, and the husband of Hera, and brother of Poseidon, and father of Athene, and Artemis, who was guilty of incest with his own daughter Persephone; or that Apollo immediately suggests the son of Leto and Zeus, and the brother of Artemis, and half-brother of Hermes; and so with all the other names invented by these wise men of Celsus, who are the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of these opinions, and the ancient theologians of the Greeks. For what are the grounds for deciding that he should on the one hand be properly called Zeus, and yet on the other should not have Kronos for his father and Rhea for his mother? And the same argument applies to all the others that are called gods. But this charge does not at all apply to those who, for some <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> reason, refer the word Sabaoth, or Adonai, or any of the other names to the (<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>) God. And when one is able to philosophize about the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of names, he will find much to say respecting the titles of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whom one is called Michael, and another Gabriel, and another Raphael, appropriately to the duties which they discharge in the world, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things. And a similar <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of names applies also to our Jesus, whose name has already been seen, in an unmistakeable manner, to have expelled myriads of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and bodies (of men), so great was the power which it exerted upon those from whom the spirits were driven out. And while still upon the subject of names, we have to mention that those who are skilled in the use of incantations, relate that the utterance of the same incantation in its proper language can accomplish what the spell professes to do; but when translated into any other tongue, it is observed to become inefficacious and feeble. And thus it is not the things signified, but the qualities and peculiarities of words, which possess a certain power for this or that purpose. And so on such grounds as these we defend the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, when they struggle even to death to avoid calling God by the name of Zeus, or to give Him a name from any other language. For they either use the common name&mdash; God&mdash; indefinitely, or with some such addition as that of the <q>Maker of all things,</q> <q>the Creator of heaven and earth</q>&mdash; He who sent down to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> those good men, to whose names that of God being added, certain mighty works are wrought among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And much more besides might be said on the subject of names, against those who think that we ought to be indifferent as to our use of them. And if the remark of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in the <em>Philebus</em> should surprise us, when he says, <q>My <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, O Protagoras, about the names of the gods is no small one,</q> seeing Philebus in his discussion with Socrates had called pleasure a <q>god,</q> how shall we not rather approve the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who apply none of the names used in the mythologies to the Creator of the world? And now enough on this subject for the present.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p>But let us see the manner in which this Celsus, who professes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything, brings a false accusation against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when he alleges that <q>they worship <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and are addicted to sorcery, in which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was their instructor.</q> Now, in what part of the writings of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> he found the lawgiver laying down the worship of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, let him tell, who professes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all about <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>; and let him show also how sorcery can exist among those who have accepted the Mosaic law, and read the injunction, <q>Neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them.</q>  Moreover, he promises to show afterwards <q>how it was through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were deceived and led into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</q> Now, if he had discovered that the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> regarding Christ was the effect of their not having heard the prophecies about Him, he would show with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> how the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> fell into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. But without any wish whatever that this should appear, he views as Jewish <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> what are no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> at all. And Celsus having promised to make us acquainted, in a subsequent part of his work, with the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, proceeds in the first place to speak of our Saviour as having been the leader of our generation, in so far as we are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>,  and says that <q>a few years ago he began to teach this doctrine, being regarded by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> Now, with respect to this point&mdash; His prior <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> a few years ago&mdash; we have to remark as follows. Could it have come to pass without divine assistance, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, desiring during these years to spread abroad His words and teaching, should have been so successful, that everywhere throughout the world, not a few <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, Greeks as well as Barbarians, learned as well as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, adopted His doctrine, so that they struggled, even to death in its defence, rather than deny it, which no one is ever related to have done for any other system? I indeed, from no wish to flatter  <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but from a desire thoroughly to examine the facts, would say that even those who are engaged in the healing of numbers of sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, do not attain their object&mdash; the cure of the body&mdash; without divine help; and if one were to succeed in delivering <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from a flood of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and excesses, and acts of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and from a contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and were to show, as evidence of such a result, one hundred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> improved in their natures (let us suppose the number to be so large), no one would reasonably say that it was without divine assistance that he had implanted in those hundred individuals a doctrine capable of removing so many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. And if any one, on a candid consideration of these things, shall admit that no improvement ever takes place among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> without divine help, how much more confidently shall he make the same assertion regarding Jesus, when he compares the former lives of many converts to His doctrine with their after conduct, and reflects in what acts of licentiousness and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> they formerly indulged, until, as Celsus, and they who think with him, allege, <q>they were deceived,</q> and accepted a doctrine which, as these individuals assert, is destructive of the life of men; but who, from the time that they adopted it, have become in some way meeker, and more religious, and more consistent, so that certain among them, from a desire of exceeding <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and a wish to worship God with greater purity, abstain even from the permitted indulgences of (lawful) <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

<p>Any one who examines the subject will see that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> attempted and successfully accomplished works beyond the reach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power. For although, from the very beginning, all things opposed the spread of His doctrine in the world, &mdash; both the princes of the times, and their chief captains and generals, and all, to speak generally, who were possessed of the smallest influence, and in addition to these, the rulers of the different cities, and the soldiers, and the people&mdash;yet it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> victorious, as being the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which is such that it cannot be hindered; and becoming more powerful than all such adversaries, it made itself master of the whole of Greece, and a considerable portion of Barbarian lands, and convened countless numbers of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to His religion. And although, among the multitude of converts to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the simple and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> necessarily outnumbered the more intelligent, as the former class always does the latter, yet Celsus, unwilling to take note of this, thinks that this philanthropic doctrine, which reaches to every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> under the sun, is vulgar,  and on account of its vulgarity and its want of reasoning power, obtained a hold only over the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. And yet he himself admits that it was not the simple alone who were led by the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to adopt His religion; for he acknowledges that there were among them some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of moderate intelligence, and gentle disposition, and possessed of understanding, and capable of comprehending allegories.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<p>And since, in imitation of a rhetorician training a pupil, he introduces a Jew, who enters into a personal discussion with Jesus, and speaks in a very childish manner, altogether unworthy of the grey hairs of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, let me endeavour, to the best of my ability, to examine his statements, and show that he does not maintain, throughout the discussion, the consistency due to the character of a Jew. For he represents him disputing with Jesus, and confuting Him, as he thinks, on many points; and in the first place, he accuses Him of having <q>invented his birth from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>,</q> and upbraids Him with being <q>born in a certain Jewish village, of a poor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of the country, who gained her subsistence by spinning, and who was turned out of doors by her husband, a carpenter by trade, because she was convicted of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; that after being driven away by her husband, and wandering about for a time, she disgracefully gave birth to Jesus, an illegitimate child, who having hired himself out as a servant in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> on account of his poverty, and having there acquired some miraculous powers, on which the Egyptians greatly <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves, returned to his own country, highly elated on account of them, and by means of these proclaimed himself a God.</q> Now, as I cannot allow anything said by unbelievers to remain unexamined, but must investigate everything from the beginning, I give it as my opinion that all these things worthily harmonize with the predictions that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>

<p>For birth is an aid towards an individual's becoming famous, and distinguished, and talked about; viz., when a man's <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> happen to be in a position of rank and influence, and are possessed of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and are able to spend it upon the education of their son, and when the country of one's birth is great and illustrious; but when a man having all these things against him is able, notwithstanding these hindrances, to make himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and to produce an impression on those who hear of him, and to become distinguished and visible to the whole world, which speaks of him as it did not do before, how can we help admiring such a nature as being both noble in itself, and devoting itself to great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and possessing a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> which is not by any means to be despised? And if one were to examine more fully the history of such an individual, why should he not seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what manner, after being reared up in frugality and poverty, and without receiving any complete education, and without having studied systems and opinions by means of which he might have acquired confidence to associate with multitudes, and play the demagogue, and attract to himself many hearers, he nevertheless devoted himself to the teaching of new opinions, introducing among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> a doctrine which not only subverted the customs of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, while preserving due respect for their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but which especially overturned the established observances of the Greeks regarding the Divinity? And how could such a person&mdash; one who had been so brought up, and who, as his <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a> admit, had learned nothing great from men&mdash; have been able to teach, in a manner not at all to be despised, such doctrines as he did regarding the divine judgment, and the punishments that are to overtake <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and the rewards that are to be conferred upon <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; so that not only rustic and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> individuals were won by his words, but also not a few of those who were distinguished by their wisdom, and who were able to discern the hidden meaning in those more common doctrines, as they were considered, which were in circulation, and which secret meaning enwrapped, so to speak, some more recondite signification still? The Seriphian, in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who reproaches Themistocles after he had become celebrated for his military skill, saying that his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> was due not to his own merits, but to his good fortune in having been born in the most illustrious country in Greece, received from the good-natured Athenian, who saw that his native country did contribute to his renown, the following reply: <q>Neither would I, had I been a Seriphian, have been so distinguished as I am, nor would you have been a Themistocles, even if you had had the good fortune to be an Athenian!</q> And now, our Jesus, who is reproached with being born in a village, and that not a Greek one, nor belonging to any nation widely esteemed, and being despised as the son of a poor labouring <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and as having on account of his poverty left his native country and hired himself out in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and being, to use the instance already quoted, not only a Seriphian, as it were, a native of a very small and undistinguished island, but even, so to speak, the meanest of the Seriphians, has yet been able to shake  the whole inhabited world not only to a degree far above what Themistocles the Athenian ever did, but beyond what even Pythagoras, or <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, or any other wise man in any part of the world whatever, or any prince or general, ever succeeded in doing. </p>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>

<p>Now, would not any one who investigated with ordinary care the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of these facts, be struck with amazement at this man's victory?&mdash; with his complete success in surmounting by his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> all causes that tended to bring him into disrepute, and with his superiority over all other illustrious individuals in the world? And yet it is a rare thing for distinguished men to succeed in acquiring a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for several things at once. For one man is admired on account of his wisdom, another for his military skill, and some of the Barbarians for their marvellous powers of incantation, and some for one quality, and others for another; but not many have been admired and acquired a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for many things at the same time; whereas this man, in addition to his other merits, is an object of admiration both for his wisdom, and for his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and for his powers of government. For he persuaded some to withdraw themselves from their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and to secede to him, not as a tyrant would do, nor as a robber, who arms  his followers against men; nor as a rich man, who bestows help upon those who come to him; nor as one of those who confessedly are deserving of censure; but as a teacher of the doctrine regarding the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things, and of the worship which belongs to Him, and of all moral precepts which are able to secure the favour of the Supreme God to him who orders his life in conformity therewith. Now, to Themistocles, or to any other man of distinction, nothing happened to prove a hindrance to their <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>; whereas to this man, besides what we have already enumerated, and which are enough to cover with dishonour the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a man even of the most noble nature, there was that apparently <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> death of crucifixion, which was enough to efface his previously acquired <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and to lead those who, as they who disavow his doctrine assert, were formerly deluded by him to abandon their delusion, and to pass condemnation upon their deceiver.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>

<p>And besides this, one may well wonder how it happened that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>&mdash; if, as the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> say, they did not see Him after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the dead, and were not persuaded of His divinity&mdash; were not afraid to endure the same sufferings with their Master, and to expose themselves to danger, and to leave their native country to teach, according to the desire of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the doctrine delivered to them by Him. For I think that no one who candidly examines the facts would say that these men devoted themselves to a life of danger for the sake of the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, without profound belief which He had wrought in their minds of its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not only teaching them to conform to His precepts, but others also, and to conform, moreover, when manifest destruction to life impended over him who ventured to introduce these new opinions into all places and before all audiences, and who could retain as his friend no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being who adhered to the former opinions and usages. For did not the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> see, when they ventured to prove not only to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from their prophetic Scriptures that this is He who was spoken of by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but also to the other <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> nations, that He who was crucified yesterday or the day before underwent this death voluntarily on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>&mdash;that this was analogous to the case of those who have died for their country in order to remove pestilence, or barrenness, or tempests? For it is probable that there is in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things, for certain <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> reasons which are difficult to be understood by the multitude, such a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that one just man, dying a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> death for the common good, might be the means of removing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits, which are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of plagues, or barrenness, or tempests, or similar calamities. Let those, therefore, who would disbelieve the statement that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died on the cross on behalf of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, say whether they also refuse to accept the many accounts current both among Greeks and Barbarians, of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have laid down their lives for the public advantage, in order to remove those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which had fallen upon cities and countries? Or will they say that such events actually happened, but that no credit is to be attached to that account which makes this so-called man to have died to ensure the destruction of a mighty <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit, the ruler of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, who had held in subjection the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> upon earth? And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, seeing this and much more (which, it is probable, they learned from Jesus in private), and being filled, moreover, with a divine power (since it was no mere poetical virgin that endowed them with strength and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom and understanding of God), exerted all their efforts <q>to become distinguished among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> not only among the Argives, but among all the Greeks and Barbarians alike, and <q>so bear away for themselves a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> renown.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>

<p>But let us now return to where the Jew is introduced, speaking of the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and saying that <q>when she was pregnant she was turned out of doors by the carpenter to whom she had been <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, as having been guilty of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and that she bore a child to a certain soldier named Panthera;</q> and let us see whether those who have blindly concocted these fables about the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> of the Virgin with Panthera, and her rejection by the carpenter, did not invent these stories to overturn His miraculous conception by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: for they could have falsified the history in a different manner, on account of its extremely miraculous character, and not have admitted, as it were against their will, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born of no ordinary <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> marriage. It was to be expected, indeed, that those who would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the miraculous birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> would invent some <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. And their not doing this in a credible manner, but (their) preserving the fact that it was not by Joseph that the Virgin conceived Jesus, rendered the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> very palpable to those who can understand and detect such inventions. Is it at all agreeable to reason, that he who dared to do so much for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, in order that, as far as in him lay, all the Greeks and Barbarians, who were looking for divine condemnation, might depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and regulate their entire conduct in a manner pleasing to the Creator of the world, should not have had a miraculous birth, but one the vilest and most disgraceful of all? And I will ask of them as Greeks, and particularly of Celsus, who either holds or not the sentiments of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and at any rate quotes them, whether He who sends <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> down into the bodies of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, degraded Him who was to dare such mighty acts, and to teach so many men, and to reform so many from the mass of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in the world, to a birth more disgraceful than any other, and did not rather introduce Him into the world through a lawful marriage? Or is it not more in conformity with reason, that every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for certain <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> reasons (I speak now according to the opinion of Pythagoras, and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and Empedocles, whom Celsus frequently names), is introduced into a body, and introduced according to its deserts and former actions? It is probable, therefore, that this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also, which conferred more benefit by its residence in the flesh than that of many men (to avoid prejudice, I do not say <q>all</q>), stood in need of a body not only superior to others, but invested with all excellent qualities.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33</h2>

<p>Now if a particular <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for certain <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> reasons, is not deserving of being placed in the body of a wholly irrational being, nor yet in that of one purely rational, but is clothed with a monstrous body, so that reason cannot discharge its functions in one so fashioned, which has the head disproportioned to the other parts, and altogether too short; and another receives such a body that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a little more rational than the other; and another still more so, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body counteracting to a greater or less degree the reception of the reasoning principle; why should there not be also some <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which receives an altogether miraculous body, possessing some qualities common to those of other men, so that it may be able to pass through life with them, but possessing also some quality of superiority, so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be able to remain untainted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? And if there be any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the doctrine of the physiognomists, whether Zopyrus, or Loxus, or Polemon, or any other who wrote on such a subject, and who profess to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in some wonderful way that all bodies are adapted to the habits of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, must there have been for that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which was to dwell with miraculous power among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and work mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, a body produced, as Celsus thinks, by an act of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> between Panthera and the Virgin?! Why, from such unhallowed intercourse there must rather have been brought forth some fool to do injury to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>&mdash;a teacher of licentiousness and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; and not of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and righteousness, and the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>!</p>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>

<p>But it was, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also predicted, from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> that there was to be born, according to the promised sign, one who was to give His name to the fact, showing that at His birth God was to be with man. Now it seems to me appropriate to the character of a Jew to have quoted the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Isaiah, which says that Immanuel was to be born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. This, however, Celsus, who professes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything, has not done, either from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or from an unwillingness (if he had read it and voluntarily passed it by in silence) to furnish an argument which might defeat his purpose. And the prediction runs thus: <q>And the Lord spoke again unto Ahaz, saying, Ask you a sign of the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; ask it either in the depth or in the height above. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord . And he said, Hear now, O house of David; is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call His name Immanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.</q>  And that it was from intentional <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> that Celsus did not quote this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, is clear to me from this, that although he makes numerous quotations from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew, as of the star that appeared at the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and other miraculous occurrences, he has made no mention at all of this. Now, if a Jew should split words, and say that the words are not, <q>Lo, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>,</q> but, <q>Lo, a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q>  we reply that the word <q>Olmah</q>&mdash; which the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> have rendered by <q>a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>,</q> and others by <q>a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></q>&mdash; occurs, as they say, in Deuteronomy, as applied to a <q>virgin,</q> in the following connection: <q>If a damsel that is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> be <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; then you shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and you shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel,  because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he humbled his neighbour's wife.</q>  And again: <q>But if a man find a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> damsel in a field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die: but unto the damsel  you shall do nothing; there is in her no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> worthy of death.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 35</h2>

<p>But that we may not seem, because of a Hebrew word, to endeavour to persuade those who are unable to determine whether they ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it or not, that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> spoke of this man being born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, because at his birth these words, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us,</q> were uttered, let us make good our point from the words themselves. The Lord is related to have spoken to Ahaz thus: <q>Ask a sign for yourself from the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either in the depth or height above;</q>  and afterwards the sign is given, <q>Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive, and bear a son.</q>  What kind of sign, then, would that have been&mdash; a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> giving birth to a child? And which of the two is the more appropriate as the mother of Immanuel (i.e., <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us</q>)&mdash;whether a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who has had intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and who has conceived after the manner of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, or one who is still a pure and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> virgin? Surely it is appropriate only to the latter to produce a being at whose birth it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us.</q> And should he be so captious as to say that it is to Ahaz that the command is addressed, <q>Ask for yourself a sign from the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> we shall ask in return, who in the times of Ahaz bore a son at whose birth the expression is made use of, <q>Immanuel,</q> i.e., <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us?</q> And if no one can be found, then manifestly what was said to Ahaz was said to the house of David, because it is written that the Saviour was born of the house of David according to the flesh; and this sign is said to be <q>in the depth or in the height,</q> since <q>He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things.</q>  And these arguments I employ as against a Jew who believes in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Let Celsus now tell me, or any of those who think with him, with what meaning the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> utters either these statements about the future, or the others which are contained in the prophecies? Is it with any foresight of the future or not? If with a foresight of the future, then the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were divinely inspired; if with no foresight of the future, let him explain the meaning of one who speaks thus boldly regarding the future, and who is an object of admiration among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> because of his prophetic powers.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36</h2>

<p>And now, since we have touched upon the subject of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, what we are about to advance will be useful not only to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they spoke by divine inspiration, but also to the more candid among the Greeks. To these we say that we must necessarily admit that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, if they were to be kept together under that system of law which had been given them, and were to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Creator of the world, as they had learned, and to be without pretexts, so far as the law was concerned, for apostatizing to the <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. And we establish this necessity in the following manner. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>,</q> as it is written in the law of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> itself, <q>shall hearken unto observers of times, and <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>;</q>  but to that people it is said: <q>But as for you, the Lord your God has not suffered you so to do.</q>  And to this is subjoined the promise: <q>A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> shall the Lord your God raise up unto you from among your brethren.</q>  Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> employ modes of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> either by oracles or by omens, or by birds, or by ventriloquists, or by those who profess the art of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, or by Chaldean genealogists&mdash; all which practices were forbidden to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>&mdash; this people, if they had no means of attaining a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of futurity, being led by the passion common to humanity of ascertaining the future would have despised their own <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as not having in them any particle of divinity; and would not have accepted any <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, nor committed their words to writing, but would have spontaneously betaken themselves to the divining usages of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, or attempted to establish some such practices among themselves. There is therefore no absurdity in their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> having uttered predictions even about events of no importance, to soothe those who desire such things, as when Samuel prophesies regarding three she-asses which were lost,  or when mention is made in the third book of Kings respecting the sickness of a king's son.  And why should not those who desired to obtain auguries from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> be severely rebuked by the administrators of the law among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?&mdash; as Elijah is found rebuking Ahaziah, and saying, <q>Is it because there is not a God in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that you go to inquire of Baalzebub, god of Ekron?</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 37</h2>

<p>I think, then, that it has been pretty well established not only that our Saviour was to be born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, but also that there were <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who uttered not merely general predictions about the future&mdash;as, e.g., regarding Christ and the kingdoms of the world, and the events that were to happen to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and those nations which were to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and many other things concerning Him&mdash;but also prophecies respecting particular events; as, for instance, how the asses of Kish, which were lost, were to be discovered, and regarding the sickness which had fallen upon the son of the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and any other recorded circumstance of a similar kind. But as a further answer to the Greeks, who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, we have to say that the Creator has shown, by the generation of several kinds of animals, that what He has done in the instance of one animal, He could do, if it pleased Him, in that of others, and also of man himself. For it is ascertained that there is a certain female animal which has no intercourse with the male (as writers on animals say is the case with vultures), and that this animal, without sexual intercourse, preserves the succession of race. What incredibility, therefore, is there in supposing that, if God wished to send a divine teacher to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, He caused Him to be born in some manner different from the common!  Nay, according to the Greeks themselves, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were not born of a man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For if the world has been created, as many even of the Greeks are pleased to admit, then the first men must have been produced not from sexual intercourse, but from the earth, in which spermatic elements <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>; which, however, I consider more incredible than that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born like other men, so far as regards the half of his birth. And there is no absurdity in employing Grecian histories to answer Greeks, with the view of showing that we are not the only <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have recourse to miraculous narratives of this kind. For some have thought fit, not in regard to ancient and heroic narratives, but in regard to events of very recent occurrence, to relate as a possible thing that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> was the son of Amphictione, Ariston being prevented from having marital intercourse with his wife until she had given birth to him with whom she was pregnant by Apollo. And yet these are veritable fables, which have led to the invention of such stories concerning a man whom they regarded as possessing greater wisdom and power than the multitude, and as having received the beginning of his corporeal substance from better and diviner elements than others, because they thought that this was appropriate to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who were too great to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings. And since Celsus has introduced the Jew disputing with Jesus, and tearing in pieces, as he imagines, the fiction of His birth from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, comparing the Greek fables about Dana&euml;, and Melanippe, and Auge, and Antiope, our answer is, that such language becomes a buffoon, and not one who is writing in a serious tone.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38</h2>

<p>But, moreover, taking the history, contained in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew, of our Lord's descent into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, he refuses to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the miraculous circumstances attending it, viz., either that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> gave the divine intimation, or that our Lord's quitting <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and residing in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was an event of any significance; but he invents something altogether different, admitting somehow the miraculous works done by Jesus, by means of which He induced the multitude to follow Him as the Christ. And yet he desires to throw discredit on them, as being done by help of magic and not by divine power; for he asserts <q>that he (Jesus), having been brought up as an illegitimate child, and having served for hire in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and then coming to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of certain miraculous powers, returned from thence to his own country, and by means of those powers proclaimed himself a god.</q> Now I do not understand how a magician should exert himself to teach a doctrine which persuades us always to act as if God were to judge every man for his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; and should have trained his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, whom he was to employ as the ministers of his doctrine, in the same belief. For did the latter make an impression upon their hearers, after they had been so taught to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; or was it without the aid of these? The assertion, therefore, that they did no <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> at all, but that, after yielding their belief to arguments which were not at all convincing, like the wisdom of Grecian dialectics,  they gave themselves up to the task of teaching the new doctrine to those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> among whom they happened to take up their abode, is altogether absurd. For in what did they place their confidence when they taught the doctrine and disseminated the new opinions? But if they indeed wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, then how can it be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that magicians exposed themselves to such hazards to introduce a doctrine which forbade the practice of magic?</p>

<h2>Chapter 39</h2>

<p>I do not think it necessary to grapple with an argument advanced not in a serious but in a scoffing spirit, such as the following: <q>If the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was beautiful, then the god whose nature is not to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a corruptible body, had intercourse with her because she was beautiful;</q> or, <q>It was improbable that the god would entertain a passion for her, because she was neither rich nor of royal rank, seeing no one, even of her neighbours, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her.</q> And it is in the same scoffing spirit that he adds: <q>When <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by her husband, and turned out of doors, she was not saved by divine power, nor was her story <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Such things,</q> he says, <q>have no connection with the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> In what respect does such language differ from that of those who pour abuse on others on the public streets, and whose words are unworthy of any serious attention?</p>

<h2>Chapter 40</h2>

<p>After these assertions, he takes from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Matthew, and perhaps also from the other <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, the account of the dove alighting upon our Saviour at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by John, and desires to throw discredit upon the statement, alleging that the narrative is a fiction. Having completely disposed, as he imagined, of the story of our Lord's birth from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, he does not proceed to deal in an orderly manner with the accounts that follow it; since passion and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> observe no order, but <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and vindictive men <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> those whom they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, as the feeling comes upon them, being prevented by their passion from arranging their accusations on a careful and orderly plan. For if he had observed a proper arrangement, he would have taken up the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and, with the view of assailing it, would. have objected to the first narrative, then passed on to the second, and so on to the others. But now, after the birth from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, this Celsus, who professes to be acquainted with all our history, attacks the account of the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the form of a dove at the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. He then, after that, tries to throw discredit upon the prediction that our Lord was to come into the world. In the next place, he runs away to what immediately follows the narrative of the birth of Jesus&mdash; the account of the star, and of the wise men who came from the east to worship the child. And you yourself may find, if you take the trouble, many confused statements made by Celsus throughout his whole book; so that even in this account he may, by those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to observe and require an orderly method of arrangement, be convicted of great rashness and boasting, in having inscribed upon his work the title of <em>A True Discourse</em>,&mdash; a thing which is never done by a learned <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says, that it is not an indication of an intelligent man to make strong assertions respecting those matters which are somewhat uncertain; and the celebrated Chrysippus even, who frequently states the reasons by which he is decided, refers us to those whom we shall find to be abler speakers than himself. This man, however, who is wiser than those already named, and than all the other Greeks, agreeably to his assertion of being acquainted with everything, inscribed upon his book the words, <em>A True Discourse</em>!</p>

<h2>Chapter 41</h2>

<p>But, that we may not have the appearance of intentionally passing by his charges through inability to refute them, we have resolved to answer each one of them separately according to our ability, attending not to the connection and sequence of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the things themselves, but to the arrangement of the subjects as they occur in this book. Let us therefore notice what he has to say by way of impugning the bodily appearance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to our Saviour in the form of a dove. And it is a Jew who addresses the following language to Him whom we acknowledge to be our Lord Jesus: <q>When you were bathing,</q> says the Jew, <q>beside John, you say that what had the appearance of a bird from the air alighted upon you.</q> And then this same Jew of his, continuing his interrogations, asks, <q>What credible <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> beheld this appearance? Or who heard a voice from heaven declaring you to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? What <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is there of it, save your own assertion, and the statement of another of those individuals who have been punished along with you?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 42</h2>

<p>Before we begin our reply, we have to remark that the endeavour to show, with regard to almost any history, however <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that it actually occurred, and to produce an intelligent conception regarding it, is one of the most difficult undertakings that can be attempted, and is in some instances an impossibility. For suppose that some one were to assert that there never had been any Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, chiefly on account of the impossible narrative interwoven therewith, about a certain Achilles being the son of a sea-goddess Thetis and of a man Peleus, or Sarpedon being the son of Zeus, or Ascalaphus and Ialmenus the sons of Ares, or &AElig;neas that of Aphrodite, how should we prove that such was the case, especially under the weight of the fiction attached, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how, to the universally prevalent opinion that there was really a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in Ilium between Greeks and Trojans? And suppose, also, that some one disbelieved the story of &OElig;dipus and Jocasta, and of their two sons Eteocles and Polynices, because the sphinx, a kind of half-virgin, was introduced into the narrative, how should we demonstrate the reality of such a thing? And in like manner also with the history of the Epigoni, although there is no such marvellous event interwoven with it, or with the return of the Heracleid&aelig;, or countless other historical events. But he who deals candidly with histories, and would wish to keep himself also from being imposed upon by them, will exercise his judgment as to what statements he will give his assent to, and what he will accept figuratively, seeking to discover the meaning of the authors of such inventions, and from what statements he will withhold his belief, as having been written for the gratification of certain individuals. And we have said this by way of anticipation respecting the whole history related in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> concerning Jesus, not as inviting men of acuteness to a simple and unreasoning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but wishing to show that there is need of candour in those who are to read, and of much investigation, and, so to speak, of insight into the meaning of the writers, that the object with which each event has been recorded may be discovered.</p>

<h2>Chapter 43</h2>

<p>We shall therefore say, in the first place, that if he who disbelieves the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the form of a dove had been described as an Epicurean, or a follower of Democritus, or a Peripatetic, the statement would have been in keeping with the character of such an objector. But now even this Celsus, wisest of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, did not perceive that it is to a Jew, who believes more incredible things contained in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> than the narrative of the appearance of the dove, that he attributes such an objection! For one might say to the Jew, when expressing his disbelief of the appearance, and thinking to assail it as a fiction, <q>How are you able to prove, sir, that the Lord spoke to Adam, or to Eve, or to Cain, or to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, or to Isaac, or to Jacob, those words which He is recorded to have spoken to these men?</q> And, to compare history with history, I would say to the Jew, <q>Even your own Ezekiel writes, saying, 'The heavens were opened, and I saw a vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.'  After relating which, he adds, 'This was the appearance of the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord; and He said to me,'</q>  etc. Now, if what is related of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> be false, since we cannot, as you suppose, clearly prove it to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it being seen or heard by Himself alone, and, as you appear to have observed, also by one of those who were punished, why should we not rather say that Ezekiel also was dealing in the marvellous when he said, <q>The heavens were opened,</q> etc.? Nay, even Isaiah asserts, <q>I saw the Lord of hosts sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and the seraphim stood round about it: the one had six wings, and the other had six wings.</q>  How can we tell whether he really saw them or not? Now, O Jew, you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> these visions to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and to have been not only shown to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> by a diviner Spirit, but also to have been both spoken and recorded by the same. And who is the more worthy of belief, when declaring that the heavens were opened before him, and that he heard a voice, or beheld the Lord of Sabaoth sitting upon a throne high and lifted up&mdash;whether Isaiah and Ezekiel or Jesus? Of the former, indeed, no work has been found equal to those of the latter; whereas the good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> have not been confined solely to the period of His tabernacling in the flesh, but up to the present time His power still produces conversion and amelioration of life in those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God through Him. And a manifest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that these things are done by His power, is the fact that, although, as He Himself said, and as is admitted, there are not labourers enough to gather in the harvest of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, there really is nevertheless such a great harvest of those who are gathered together and conveyed into the everywhere existing threshing-floors and Churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44</h2>

<p>And with these arguments I answer the Jew, not disbelieving, I who am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, Ezekiel and Isaiah, but being very desirous to show, on the footing of our common belief, that this man is far more worthy of credit than they are when He says that He beheld such a sight, and, as is probable, related to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the vision which He saw, and told them of the voice which He heard. But another party might object, that not all those who have narrated the appearance of the dove and the voice from heaven heard the accounts of these things from Jesus, but that that Spirit which taught <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the history of events before his own time, beginning with the creation, and descending down to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> his father, taught also the writers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the miraculous occurrence which took place at the time of Jesus' <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And he who is adorned with the spiritual gift,  called the <q>word of wisdom,</q> will explain also the reason of the heavens opening, and the dove appearing, and why the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> appeared to Jesus in the form of no other living thing than that of a dove. But our present subject does not require us to explain this, our purpose being to show that Celsus displayed no sound judgment in representing a Jew as disbelieving, on such grounds, a fact which has greater probability in its favour than many events in which he firmly reposes confidence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 45</h2>

<p>And I remember on one occasion, at a disputation held with certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were reputed learned men, having employed the following argument in the presence of many judges: <q>Tell me, sirs,</q> I said, <q>since there are two individuals who have visited the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, regarding whom are related marvellous works surpassing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power&mdash; <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, viz., your own legislator, who wrote about himself, and Jesus our teacher, who has left no writings regarding Himself, but to whom testimony is borne by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>&mdash; what are the grounds for deciding that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> as speaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, although the Egyptians <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> him as a sorcerer, and as appearing to have wrought his mighty works by jugglery, while Jesus is not to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> because you are His accusers? And yet there are nations which bear testimony in favour of both: the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who do not deny the prophetic mission of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but proving from that very source the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the statement regarding Jesus, accept as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> the miraculous circumstances related of Him by His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Now, if you ask us for the reasons of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Jesus, give yours first for believing in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who lived before Him, and then we shall give you ours for accepting the latter. But if you draw back, and shirk a demonstration, then we, following your own example, decline for the present to offer any demonstration likewise. Nevertheless, admit that you have no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to offer for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and then listen to our defence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> derived from the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And now observe what is almost incredible! It is shown from the declarations concerning Jesus, contained in the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that both <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 46</h2>

<p>For the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are full of marvels similar to those recorded of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, viz., regarding the dove and the voice from heaven. And I think the wonders wrought by Jesus are a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit's</a> having then appeared in the form of a dove, although Celsus, from a desire to cast discredit upon them, alleges that He performed only what He had learned among the Egyptians. And I shall refer not only to His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but, as is proper, to those also of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of Jesus. For they could not without the help of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and wonders have prevailed on those who heard their new doctrines and new teachings to abandon their national usages, and to accept their instructions at the danger to themselves even of death. And there are still preserved among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> traces of that <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which appeared in the form of a dove. They expel <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, and perform many cures, and foresee certain events, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>. And although Celsus, or the Jew whom he has introduced, may treat with mockery what I am going to say, I shall say it nevertheless&mdash;that many have been converted to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as if against their will, some sort of spirit having suddenly transformed their minds from a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the doctrine to a readiness to die in its defence, and having appeared to them either in a waking vision or a dream of the night. Many such instances have we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, which, if we were to commit to writing,  although they were seen and witnessed by ourselves, we should afford great occasion for ridicule to unbelievers, who would <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that we, like those whom they suppose to have invented such things, had ourselves also done the same. But God is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of our conscientious desire, not by false statements, but by testimonies of different kinds, to establish the divinity of the doctrine of Jesus. And as it is a Jew who is perplexed about the account of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> having descended upon Jesus in the form of a dove, we would say to him, <q>Sir, who is it that says in Isaiah, 'And now the Lord has sent me and His Spirit.'</q>  In which sentence, as the meaning is doubtful&mdash; viz., whether the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> sent Jesus, or the Father sent both Christ and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>&mdash; the latter is correct. For, because the Saviour was sent, afterwards the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was sent also, that the prediction of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> might be fulfilled; and as it was necessary that the fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to posterity, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> for that reason committed the result to writing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 47</h2>

<p>I would like to say to Celsus, who represents the Jew as accepting somehow John as a Baptist, who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Jesus, that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of John the Baptist, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is related by one who lived no great length of time after John and Jesus. For in the 18th book of his <em>Antiquities</em>  <em>of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em>, <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to John as having been a Baptist, and as promising purification to those who underwent the rite. Now this writer, although not believing in Jesus as the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, in seeking after the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple, whereas he ought to have said that the conspiracy against Jesus was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these calamities befalling the people, since they <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> Christ, who was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, says nevertheless&mdash; being, although against his will, not far from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash; that these disasters happened to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as a punishment for the death of <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the Just</a>, who was a brother of Jesus (called Christ),&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> having put him to death, although he was a man most distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.  <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a genuine <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, says that he regarded this James as a <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>, not so much on account of their relationship by blood, or of their being brought up together, as because of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and doctrine.  If, then, he says that it was on account of James that the desolation of Jerusalem was made to overtake the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, how should it not be more in accordance with reason to say that it happened on account (of the death) of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, of whose divinity so many Churches are witnesses, composed of those who have been convened from a flood of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and who have joined themselves to the Creator, and who refer all their actions to His good pleasure.</p>

<h2>Chapter 48</h2>

<p>Although the Jew, then, may offer no defence for himself in the instances of Ezekiel and Isaiah, when we compare the opening of the heavens to Jesus, and the voice that was heard by Him, to the similar cases which we find recorded in Ezekiel and Isaiah, or any other of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, we nevertheless, so far as we can, shall support our position, maintaining that, as it is a matter of belief that in a <em>dream</em> impressions have been brought before the minds of many, some relating to divine things, and others to future events of this life, and this either with clearness or in an enigmatic manner&mdash;a fact which is manifest to all who accept the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>; so how is it absurd to say that the mind which could receive impressions in a <em>dream</em> should be impressed also in a waking vision, for the benefit either of him on whom the impressions are made, or of those who are to hear the account of them from him? And as in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> we fancy that we hear, and that the organs of hearing are actually impressed, and that we see with our eyes&mdash; although neither the bodily organs of sight nor hearing are affected, but it is the mind alone which has these sensations&mdash; so there is no absurdity in believing that similar things occurred to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when it is recorded that they witnessed occurrences of a rather wonderful kind, as when they either heard the words of the Lord or beheld the heavens opened. For I do not suppose that the visible heaven was actually opened, and its physical structure divided, in order that Ezekiel might be able to record such an occurrence. Should not, therefore, the same be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> of the Saviour by every intelligent hearer of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>?&mdash; although such an occurrence may be a stumbling-block to the simple, who in their simplicity would set the whole world in movement, and split in sunder the compact and mighty body of the whole heavens. But he who examines such matters more profoundly will say, that there being, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> calls it, a kind of general divine perception which the blessed man alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to discover, according to the saying of Solomon, <q>You shall find the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  and as there are various forms of this perceptive power, such as a faculty of vision which can naturally see things that are better than bodies, among which are ranked the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> and seraphim; and a faculty of hearing which can perceive voices which have not their being in the air; and a sense of taste which can make use of living bread that has come down from heaven, and that gives life unto the world; and so also a sense of smelling, which scents such things as leads <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to say that he is a sweet savour of Christ unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  and a sense of touch, by which John says that he <q>handled with his hands of the Word of life;</q> &mdash; the blessed <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> having discovered this divine perception, and seeing and hearing in this divine manner, and tasting likewise, and smelling, so to speak, with no sensible organs of perception, and laying hold on the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that a healing effluence from it comes upon them, saw in this manner what they record as having seen, and heard what they say they heard, and were affected in a similar manner to what they describe when eating the roll of a book that was given them.  And so also Isaac smelled the savour of his son's divine garments,  and added to the spiritual blessing these words: <q>See, the savour of my son is as the savour of a full field which the Lord blessed.</q>  And similarly to this, and more as a matter to be understood by the mind than to be perceived by the senses, Jesus touched the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>,  to cleanse him, as I think, in a twofold sense&mdash;freeing him not only, as the multitude heard, from the visible <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> by visible contact, but also from that other <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, by His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine touch. It is in this way, accordingly, that John testifies when he says, <q>I beheld the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon Him. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not; but He that sent me to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with water, the same said to me, Upon whom you will see the Spirit descending, and abiding on Him, the same is He that baptizes with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And I saw, and bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that this is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q>  Now it was to Jesus that the heavens were opened; and on that occasion no one except John is recorded to have seen them opened. But with respect to this opening of the heavens, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, foretelling to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that it would happen, and that they would see it, says, <q>Verily, verily, I say unto you, You shall see the heavens opened, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God ascending and descending upon the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</q>  And so <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was carried away into the third heaven, having previously seen it opened, since he was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Jesus. It does not, however, belong to our present object to explain why <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>Whether in the body, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; or whether out of the body, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not: God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>.</q>  But I shall add to my argument even those very points which Celsus imagines, viz., that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Himself related the account of the opening of the heavens, and the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> upon Him at the Jordan in the form of a dove, although the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> does not assert that He said that He saw it. For this great man did not perceive that it was not in keeping with Him who commanded His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> on the occasion of the vision on the mount, <q>Tell what you have seen to no man, until the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be risen from the dead,</q>  to have related to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> what was seen and heard by John at the Jordan. For it may be observed as a trait of the character of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that He on all occasions avoided unnecessary talk about Himself; and on that account said, <q>If I speak of Myself, My <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q>  And since He avoided unnecessary talk about Himself, and preferred to show by acts rather than words that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for that reason said to Him, <q>If You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, tell us plainly.</q>  And as it is a Jew who, in the work of Celsus, uses the language to Jesus regarding the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the form of a dove, <q>This is your own testimony, unsupported save by one of those who were sharers of your punishment, whom you adduce,</q> it is necessary for us to show him that such a statement is not appropriately placed in the mouth of a Jew. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> do not connect John with Jesus, nor the punishment of John with that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And by this instance, this man who boasts of universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is convicted of not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what words he ought to ascribe to a Jew engaged in a disputation with Jesus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 49</h2>

<p>After this he wilfully sets aside, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not why, the strongest evidence in confirmation of the claims of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, viz., that His coming was predicted by the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and those who succeeded as well as preceded that legislator&mdash; from inability, as I think, to meet the argument that neither the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> nor any other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Christ was the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. But perhaps he was unacquainted with the prophecies relating to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For no one who was acquainted with the statements of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that many <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold the advent of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, would have ascribed to a Jew sentiments which it would have better befitted a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> or a Sadducee to utter; nor would the Jew in the dialogue have expressed himself in language like the following: <q>But my <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> once declared in Jerusalem, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> will come as the Judge of the righteous and the Punisher of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</q> Now it is not one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> merely who predicted the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But although the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, who receive the books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> alone, would say that there were contained in them predictions regarding Christ, yet certainly not in Jerusalem, which is not even mentioned in the times of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, was the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> uttered. It were indeed to be desired, that all the accusers of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> were equally <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> with Celsus, not only of the facts, but of the bare letter of Scripture, and would so direct their assaults against it, that their arguments might not have the least available influence in shaking, I do not say the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but the little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of unstable and temporary <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. A Jew, however, would not admit that any <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> used the expression, <q>The '<a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>' will come;</q> for the term which they employ is, <q>The 'Christ of God?' will come.</q> And many a time indeed do they directly interrogate us about the <q><a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> saying that no such being exists, or was made the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. We do not of course assert that the <q><a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></q> is not the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; but we assert that he most inappropriately attributes to the Jewish disputant, who would not allow that He was, such language as, <q>My <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> once declared in Jerusalem that the '<a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>' will come.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 50</h2>

<p>In the next place, as if the only event predicted were this, that He was to be <q>the Judge of the righteous and the Punisher of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>,</q> and as if neither the place of His birth, nor the sufferings which He was to endure at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nor His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> which He was to perform, had been made the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, he continues: <q>Why should it be you alone, rather than innumerable others, who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> after the prophecies were published, to whom these predictions are applicable?</q> And desiring, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how, to suggest to others the possibility of the notion that they themselves were the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> referred to by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, he says that <q>some, carried away by enthusiasm, and others having gathered a multitude of followers, give out that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has come down from heaven.</q> Now we have not ascertained that such occurrences are admitted to have taken place among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. We have to remark then, in the first place, that many of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have uttered predictions in all kinds of ways  regarding Christ; some by means of dark sayings, others in allegories or in some other manner, and some also in express words. And as in what follows he says, in the character of the Jew addressing the converts from his own nation, and repeating emphatically and malevolently, that <q>the prophecies referred to the events of his life may also suit other events as well,</q> we shall state a few of them out of a greater number; and with respect to these, any one who chooses may say what he thinks fitted to ensure a refutation of them, and which may turn away intelligent <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 51</h2>

<p>Now the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> speaks, respecting the place of the Saviour's birth&mdash; that the Ruler was to come forth from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>&mdash; in the following manner: <q>And you <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, house of Ephrata, are not the least among the thousands of Judah: for out of you shall He come forth unto Me who is to be Ruler in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and His goings forth have been of old, from everlasting.</q>  Now this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> could not suit any one of those who, as Celsus' Jew says, were fanatics and mob-leaders, and who gave out that they had come from heaven, unless it were clearly shown that He had been born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, or, as another might say, had come forth from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> to be the leader of the people. With respect to the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, if any one desires, after the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Micah and after the history recorded in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, to have additional evidence from other sources, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, in conformity with the narrative in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> regarding His birth, there is shown at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> the cave  where He was born, and the manger in the cave where He was wrapped in swaddling-clothes. And this sight is greatly talked of in surrounding places, even among the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it being said that in this cave was born that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who is worshipped and reverenced by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.  Moreover, I am of opinion that, before the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> of the people, on account of the distinctness and clearness of this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, taught that in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> the Christ was to be born. And this opinion had prevailed also extensively among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; for which reason it is related that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, on inquiring at the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> of the people, heard from them that the Christ was to be born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, <q>whence David was.</q> It is stated also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John, that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> declared that the Christ was to be born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, <q>whence David was.</q>  But after our Lord's coming, those who busied themselves with overthrowing the belief that the place of His birth had been the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> from the beginning, withheld such teaching from the people; acting in a similar manner to those individuals who won over those soldiers of the guard stationed around the tomb who had seen Him arise from the dead, and who instructed these eye-witnesses to report as follows: <q>Say that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, while we slept, came and stole Him away. And if this come to the governor's ears, we shall persuade him, and secure you.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 52</h2>

<p>Strife and prejudice are powerful instruments in leading men to disregard even those things which are abundantly clear; so that they who have somehow become familiar with certain opinions, which have deeply imbued their minds, and stamped them with a certain character, will not give them up. For a man will abandon his habits in respect to other things, although it may be difficult for him to tear himself from them, more easily than he will surrender his opinions. Nay, even the former are not easily put aside by those who have become accustomed to them; and so neither houses, nor cities, nor villages, nor intimate acquaintances, are willingly forsaken when we are prejudiced in their favour. This, therefore, was a reason why many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at that time disregarded the clear testimony of the prophecies, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which Jesus wrought, and of the sufferings which He is related to have endured. And that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is thus affected, will be manifest to those who observe that those who have once been prejudiced in favour of the most contemptible and paltry traditions of their ancestors and fellow citizens, with difficulty lay them aside. For example, no one could easily persuade an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> to despise what he had learned from his fathers, so as no longer to consider this or that irrational animal as a god, or not to guard against eating, even under the penalty of death, of the flesh of such an animal. Now, if in carrying our examination of this subject to a considerable length, we have enumerated the points respecting <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> regarding it, we consider that we were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to do this, by way of defence against those who would assert that if the prophecies current among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> regarding Jesus were so clear as we represent them, why did they not at His coming give in their adhesion to His doctrine, and betake themselves to the better life pointed out by Him? Let no one, however, bring such a reproach against <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, since he may see that reasons of no light weight are assigned by those who have learned to state them, for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Jesus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 53</h2>

<p>And if we should ask for a second <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, which may appear to us to have a clear reference to Jesus, we would quote that which was written by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> very many years before the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when he makes Jacob, on his departure from this life, to have uttered predictions regarding each of his sons, and to have said of Judah along with the others: <q>The ruler will not fail from Judah, and the governor from his loins, until that which is reserved for him come.</q>  Now, any one meeting with this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, which is in reality much older than <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, so that one who was not a believer might suspect that it was not written by him, would be surprised that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> should be able to predict that the princes of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, seeing there are among them twelve tribes, should be born of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, and should be the rulers of the people; for which reason also the whole nation are called <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, deriving their name from the ruling tribe. And, in the second place, one who candidly considers the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, would be surprised how, after declaring that the rulers and governors of the people were to proceed from the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, he should determine also the limit of their rule, saying that <q>the ruler should not fail from Judah, nor the governor from his loins, until there should come that which was reserved for him, and that He is the expectation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q>  For He came for whom these things were reserved, viz., the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the ruler of the promises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And manifestly He is the only one among those who preceded, and, I might make bold to say, among those also who followed Him, who was the expectation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; for converts from among all the Gentile nations have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on God through Him, and that in conformity with the prediction of Isaiah, that in His name the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> had hoped: <q>In Your name shall the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> hope.</q>  And this man said also to those who are in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, as every man is a captive to the chains of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <q>Come forth;</q> and to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, <q>Come into the light:</q> these things also having been thus foretold: <q>I have given You for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to inherit the desolate heritage; saying to the prisoners, Go forth; and to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves.</q>  And we may see at the appearing of this man, by means of those who everywhere throughout the world have reposed a simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him, the fulfilment of this prediction: <q>They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all the beaten tracks.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 54</h2>

<p>And since Celsus, although professing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all about the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, reproaches the Saviour because of His sufferings, saying that He received no assistance from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or was unable to aid Himself; we have to state that His sufferings were the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, along with the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of them; because it was for the benefit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> that He should die on their account,  and should suffer stripes because of His condemnation. It was predicted, moreover, that some from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> would come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him (among whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are not included); and it had been declared that He would be seen in a form which is deemed dishonourable among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The words of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> run thus: <q>Lo, my Servant shall have understanding, and shall be exalted and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and raised exceedingly high. In like manner, many shall be astonished at You; so Your form shall be in no <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> among the sons of men. Lo, many nations shall marvel because of Him; and kings shall close their mouths: because they, to whom no message about Him was sent, shall see Him; and they who have not heard of Him, shall have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him.</q>  <q>Lord, who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report? And to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed? We have reported, as a child before Him, as a root in a thirsty ground. He has no form nor <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and we beheld Him, and He had not any form nor beauty: but His appearance was without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and deficient more than that of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. He was a man under suffering, and who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to bear sickness: because His countenance was averted, He was treated with disrespect, and was made of no account. This man bears our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and suffers pain on our behalf; and we regarded Him as in trouble, and in suffering, and as ill-treated. But He was wounded for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him; by His stripes we were healed. We all, like sheep, wandered from the way. A man wandered in his way, and the Lord delivered Him on account of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and He, because of His <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> treatment, opens not His mouth. As a sheep was He led to slaughter; and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He opens not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away. And who shall describe His generation? Because His life is taken away from the earth; because of the iniquities of My people was He led unto death.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 55</h2>

<p>Now I remember that, on one occasion, at a disputation held with certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who were reckoned wise men, I quoted these prophecies; to which my Jewish opponent replied, that these predictions bore reference to the whole people, regarded as <em>one individual</em>, and as being in a state of dispersion and suffering, in order that many proselytes might be gained, on account of the dispersion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> among numerous <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> nations. And in this way he explained the words, <q>Your form shall be of no <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>;</q> and then, <q>They to whom no message was sent respecting him shall see;</q> and the expression, <q>A man under suffering.</q> Many arguments were employed on that occasion during the discussion to prove that these predictions regarding one particular person were not rightly applied by them to the whole nation. And I asked to what character the expression would be appropriate, <q>This man bears our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and suffers pain on our behalf;</q> and this, <q>But He was wounded for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and bruised for our iniquities;</q> and to whom the expression properly belonged, <q>By His stripes were we healed.</q> For it is manifest that it is they who had been sinners, and had been healed by the Saviour's sufferings (whether belonging to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation or converts from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>), who use such language in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who foresaw these events, and who, under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, applied these words to a person. But we seemed to press them hardest with the expression, <q>Because of the iniquities of My people was He led away unto death.</q> For if the people, according to them, are the subject of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, how is the man said to be led away to death because of the iniquities of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless he be a different person from that people of God? And who is this person save <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, by whose stripes they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him are healed, when <q>He had spoiled the principalities and powers (that were over us), and had made a show of them openly on His cross?</q>  At another time we may explain the several parts of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, leaving none of them unexamined. But these matters have been treated at greater length, necessarily as I think, on account of the language of the Jew, as quoted in the work of Celsus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 56</h2>

<p>Now it escaped the notice of Celsus, and of the Jew whom he has introduced, and of all who are not <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in Jesus, that the prophecies speak of two advents of Christ: the former characterized by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> suffering and humility, in order that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, being with men, might make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way that leads to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and might leave no man in this life a ground of excuse, in saying that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not of the judgment to come; and the latter, distinguished only by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and divinity, having no element of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity intermingled with its divine greatness. To quote the prophecies at length would be tedious; and I deem it sufficient for the present to quote a part of the <a href="../bible/psa044.htm">forty-fifth Psalm</a>, which has this inscription, in addition to others, <q>A Psalm for the Beloved,</q> where God is evidently addressed in these words: <q>Grace is poured into Your lips: therefore God will bless You for ever and ever. Gird Your sword on Your thigh, O mighty One, with Your beauty and Your majesty. And stretch forth, and ride prosperously, and reign, because of Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and meekness, and righteousness; and Your right hand shall lead You marvellously. Your arrows are pointed, O mighty One; the people will fall under You in the heart of the enemies of the King.</q>  But attend carefully to what follows, where He is called God: <q>For Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Your kingdom. You have loved righteousness, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity: therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above Your fellows.</q>  And observe that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, speaking familiarly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose <q>throne is for ever and ever,</q> and <q>a sceptre of righteousness the sceptre of His kingdom,</q> says that this God has been anointed by a God who was His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and anointed, because more than His fellows He had loved righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity. And I remember that I pressed the Jew, who was deemed a learned man, very hard with this passage; and he, being perplexed about it, gave such an answer as was in keeping with his Judaistic views, saying that the words, <q>Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Your kingdom,</q> are spoken of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things; and these, <q>You have loved righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity, therefore Your God has anointed You,</q> etc., refer to the Messiah. </p>

<h2>Chapter 57</h2>

<p>The Jew, moreover, in the treatise, addresses the Saviour thus: <q>If you say that every man, born according to the decree of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, in what respect should you differ from another?</q> In reply to whom we say, that every man who, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> expresses it, is no longer under <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, as a schoolmaster, but who chooses good for its own sake, is <q>a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>;</q> but this man is distinguished far and wide above every man who is called, on account of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, seeing He is, as it were, a kind of source and beginning of all such. The words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> are as follow: <q>For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</q>  But, according to the Jew of Celsus, <q>countless individuals will convict Jesus of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, alleging that those predictions which were spoken of him were intended of them.</q> We are not aware, indeed, whether Celsus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of any who, after coming into this world, and having desired to act as Jesus did, declared themselves to be also the <q>sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> or the <q>power</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But since it is in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that we examine each passage, we shall mention that there was a certain Theudas among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> before the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who gave himself out as some great one, after whose death his deluded followers were completely dispersed. And after him, in the days of the census, when Jesus appears to have been born, one Judas, a <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilean</a>, gathered around him many of the Jewish people, saying he was a wise man, and a teacher of certain new doctrines. And when he also had paid the penalty of his rebellion, his doctrine was overturned, having taken hold of very few <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> indeed, and these of the very humblest condition. And after the times of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus the Samaritan</a> also wished to persuade the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> that he was the Christ predicted by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; and he appears to have gained over some to his views. But it is not absurd, in quoting the extremely wise observation of that <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a> named in the book of Acts, to show how those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> above mentioned were strangers to the promise, being neither <q>sons of God</q> nor <q>powers</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas Christ Jesus was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a>, in the passage referred to, said: <q>If this counsel or this work be of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, it will come to nought</q> (as also did the designs of those men already mentioned after their death); <q>but if it be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you cannot overthrow this doctrine, lest haply you be found even to fight against God.</q>  There was also Simon the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> magician, who wished to draw away certain by his magical arts. And on that occasion he was successful; but now-a-days it is impossible to find, I suppose, thirty of his followers in the entire world, and probably I have even overstated the number. There are exceedingly few in Palestine; while in the rest of the world, through which he desired to spread the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his name, you find it nowhere mentioned. And where it is found, it is found quoted from the Acts of the Apostles; so that it is to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that he owes this mention of himself, the unmistakeable result having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that Simon was in no respect divine.</p>

<h2>Chapter 58</h2>

<p>After these matters this Jew of Celsus, instead of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, says that <q>Chaldeans are spoken of by Jesus as having been induced to come to him at his birth, and to worship him while yet an infant as a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to have made this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> the tetrarch; and that the latter sent and slew all the infants that had been born about the same time, thinking that in this way he would ensure his death among the others; and that he was led to do this through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that, if Jesus lived to a sufficient age, he would obtain the throne.</q> See now in this instance the blunder of one who cannot distinguish between <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> and Chaldeans, nor perceive that what they profess is different, and so has falsified the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narrative. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, moreover, why he has passed by in silence the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which led the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> to come, and why he has not stated, according to the scriptural account, that it was a star seen by them in the east. Let us see now what answer we have to make to these statements. The star that was seen in the east we consider to have been a new star, unlike any of the other well-known planetary bodies, either those in the firmament above or those among the lower orbs, but partaking of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of those celestial bodies which appear at times, such as comets, or those meteors which resemble beams of wood, or beards, or wine jars, or any of those other names by which the Greeks are accustomed to describe their varying appearances. And we establish our position in the following manner.</p>

<h2>Chapter 59</h2>

<p>It has been observed that, on the occurrence of great events, and of mighty changes in terrestrial things, such stars are wont to appear, indicating either the removal of dynasties or the breaking out of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, or the happening of such circumstances as may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> commotions upon the earth. But we have read in the <em>Treatise on Comets</em> by Ch&aelig;remon the Stoic, that on some occasions also, when <em>good</em> was to happen, comets made their appearance; and he gives an account of such instances. If, then, at the commencement of new dynasties, or on the occasion of other important events, there arises a comet so called, or any similar celestial body, why should it be matter of wonder that at the birth of Him who was to introduce a new doctrine to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> His teaching not only to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but also to Greeks, and to many of the barbarous nations besides, a star should have arisen? Now I would say, that with respect to comets there is no <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in circulation to the effect that such and such a comet was to arise in connection with a particular kingdom or a particular time; but with respect to the appearance of a star at the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Balaam recorded by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to this effect: <q>There shall arise a star out of Jacob, and a man shall rise up out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  And now, if it shall be deemed necessary to examine the narrative about the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, and the appearance of the star at the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the following is what we have to say, partly in answer to the Greeks, and partly to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 60</h2>

<p>To the Greeks, then, I have to say that the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, being on familiar terms with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, and invoking them for such purposes as their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and wishes extend to, bring about such results only as do not appear to exceed the superhuman power and strength of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, and of the spells which invoke them, to accomplish; but should some greater manifestation of divinity be made, then the powers of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> are overthrown, being unable to resist the light of divinity. It is probable, therefore, that since at the birth of Jesus <q>a multitude of the heavenly host,</q> as Luke records, and as I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, <q>praised <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men,</q> the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> on that account became feeble, and lost their strength, the falsity of their sorcery being manifested, and their power being broken; this overthrow being brought about not only by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> having visited the terrestrial regions on account of the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, but also by the power of Jesus Himself, and His innate divinity. The <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, accordingly, wishing to produce the customary results, which formerly they used to perform by means of certain spells and sorceries, sought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the reason of their failure, conjecturing the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be a great one; and beholding a divine sign in the heaven, they desired to learn its signification. I am therefore of opinion that, possessing as they did the prophecies of Balaam, which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also records, inasmuch as Balaam was celebrated for such predictions, and finding among them the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> about the star, and the words, <q>I shall show him to him, but not now; I deem him <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, although he will not be near,</q>  they conjectured that the man whose appearance had been foretold along with that of the star, had actually come into the world; and having predetermined that he was superior in power to all <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and to all common appearances and powers, they resolved to offer him homage. They came, accordingly, to <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, persuaded that some king had been born; but not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> over what kingdom he was to reign, and being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> also of the place of his birth, bringing gifts, which they offered to him as one whose nature partook, if I may so speak, both of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of a mortal man&mdash;gold, viz., as to a king; myrrh, as to one who was mortal; and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, as to a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and they brought these offerings after they had learned the place of His birth. But since He was a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Saviour of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, raised far above all those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> which minister to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> rewarded the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> for their worship of Him, by making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them that they were not to go back to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, but to return to their own homes by another way.</p>

<h2>Chapter 61</h2>

<p>That <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> conspired against the Child (although the Jew of Celsus does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this really happened), is not to be wondered at. For <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is in a certain sense blind, and would desire to defeat <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, as if it were stronger than it. And this being <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> condition, he both <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that a king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had been born, and yet cherished a purpose contradictory of such a belief; not seeing that the Child is assuredly either a king and will come to the throne, or that he is not to be a king, and that his death, therefore, will be to no purpose. He desired accordingly to kill Him, his mind being agitated by contending <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> on account of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and being instigated by the blind and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who from the very beginning plotted against the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, imagining that He was and would become some mighty one. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, however, perceiving the course of events, intimated to Joseph, although Celsus may not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it, that he was to withdraw with the Child and His mother into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, while <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> slew all the infants that were in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> and the surrounding borders, in the hope that he would thus destroy Him also who had been born King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For he saw not the sleepless guardian power that is around those who deserve to be protected and preserved for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of whom Jesus is the first, superior to all others in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and excellence, who was to be a King indeed, but not in the sense that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> supposed, but in that in which it became God to bestow a kingdom,&mdash; for the benefit, viz., of those who were to be under His sway, who was to confer no ordinary and unimportant blessings, so to speak, upon His subjects, but who was to train them and to subject them to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And Jesus, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this well, and denying that He was a king in the sense that the multitude expected, but declaring the superiority of His kingdom, says: <q>If My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: but now is My kingdom not of this world.</q>  Now, if Celsus had seen this, he would not have said: <q>But if, then, this was done in order that you might not reign in his stead when you had grown to man's estate; why, after you did reach that estate, do you not become a king, instead of you, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, wandering about in so mean a condition, hiding yourself through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and leading a miserable life up and down?</q> Now, it is not dishonourable to avoid exposing one's self to dangers, but to guard carefully against them, when this is done, not through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, but from a desire to benefit others by remaining in life, until the proper time come for one who has assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to die a death that will be useful to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. And this is plain to him who reflects that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash;a point of which we have spoken to the best of our ability in the preceding pages.</p>

<h2>Chapter 62</h2>

<p>And after such statements, showing his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> even of the number of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, he proceeds thus: <q>Jesus having gathered around him ten or eleven <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of notorious character, the very wickedest of tax-gatherers and sailors, fled in company with them from place to place, and obtained his living in a shameful and importunate manner.</q> Let us to the best of our power see what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> there is in such a statement. It is manifest to us all who possess the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narratives, which Celsus does not appear even to have read, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> selected twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and that of these Matthew alone was a tax-gatherer; that when he calls them indiscriminately sailors, he probably means James and John, because they left their ship and their father Zebedee, and followed Jesus; for Peter and his brother Andrew, who employed a net to gain their necessary subsistence, must be classed not as sailors, but as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> describes them, as fishermen. The Lebes  also, who was a follower of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, may have been a tax-gatherer; but he was not of the number of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, except according to a statement in one of the copies of Mark's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.  And we have not ascertained the employments of the remaining <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, by which they earned their livelihood before becoming <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Jesus. I assert, therefore, in answer to such statements as the above, that it is clear to all who are able to institute an intelligent and candid examination into the history of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that it was by help of a divine power that these men taught <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and succeeded in leading others to embrace the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it was not any power of speaking, or any orderly arrangement of their message, according to the arts of Grecian dialectics or rhetoric, which was in them the effective <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of converting their hearers. Nay, I am of opinion that if Jesus had selected some individuals who were wise according to the apprehension of the multitude, and who were fitted both to think and speak so as to please them, and had used such as the ministers of His doctrine, He would most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> have been suspected of employing artifices, like those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who are the leaders of certain <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, and consequently the promise respecting the divinity of His doctrine would not have manifested itself; for had the doctrine and the preaching consisted in the persuasive utterance and arrangement of words, then <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also, like that of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the world in their opinions, would have been through the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and not through the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now, who is there on seeing fishermen and tax-gatherers, who had not acquired even the merest elements of learning (as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> relates of them, and in respect to which Celsus believes that they speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, inasmuch as it is their own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which they record), discoursing boldly not only among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Jesus, but also preaching Him with success among other nations, would not inquire whence they derived this power of persuasion, as theirs was certainly not the common method followed by the multitude? And who would not say that the promise, <q>Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q>  had been accomplished by Jesus in the history of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> by a sort of divine power? And to this also, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, referring in terms of commendation, as we have stated a little above, says: <q>And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should not stand in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  For, according to the predictions in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, foretelling the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>the Lord gave the word in great power to them who preached it, even the King of the powers of the Beloved,</q>  in order that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> might be fulfilled which said, <q>His words shall run very swiftly.</q>  And we see that <q>the voice of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> has gone forth into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.</q>  On this account are they who hear the word powerfully proclaimed filled with power, which they manifest both by their dispositions and their lives, and by struggling even to death on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; while some are altogether empty, although they profess to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God through Jesus, inasmuch as, not possessing any divine power, they have the appearance only of being converted to the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And although I have previously mentioned a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> declaration uttered by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, I shall nevertheless quote it again, as appropriate to the present occasion, as it confirms both the divine manifestation of our Saviour's foreknowledge regarding the preaching of His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and the power of His word, which without the aid of teachers gains the mastery over those who yield their assent to persuasion accompanied with divine power; and the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> referred to are, <q>The harvest is plenteous, but the labourers are few; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth labourers into His harvest.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 63</h2>

<p>And since Celsus has termed the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> men of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> notoriety, saying that they were tax-gatherers and sailors of the vilest character, we have to remark, with respect to this charge, that he seems, in order to bring an accusation against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> accounts only where he pleases, and to express his disbelief of them, in order that he may not be forced to admit the manifestations of Divinity related in these same books; whereas one who sees the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by which the writers are influenced, ought, from their narration of things of inferior importance, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also the account of divine things. Now in the general Epistle of Barnabas, from which perhaps Celsus took the statement that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were notoriously <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, it is recorded that <q>Jesus selected His own <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who were more guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than all other evildoers.</q>  And in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke, Peter says to Jesus, <q>Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful man.</q>  Moreover, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who himself also at a later time became an apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, says in his Epistle to Timothy, <q>This is a faithful saying, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.</q>  And I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how Celsus should have forgotten or not have thought of saying something about <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the founder, after Jesus, of the Churches that are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He saw, probably, that anything he might say about that apostle would require to be explained, in consistency with the fact that, after being a persecutor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, and a bitter opponent of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, who went so far even as to deliver over the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to death, so great a change afterwards passed over him, that he preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from Jerusalem round about to <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>, and was ambitious to carry the glad tidings where he needed not to build upon another man's foundation, but to places where the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Christ had not been proclaimed at all. What absurdity, therefore, is there, if Jesus, desiring to manifest to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> the power which He possesses to heal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, should have selected notorious and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, and should have raised them to such a degree of moral excellence, that they became a pattern of the purest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to all who were converted by their instrumentality to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Christ?</p>

<h2>Chapter 64</h2>

<p>But if we were to reproach those who have been converted with their former lives, then we would have occasion to accuse Ph&aelig;do also, even after he became a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>; since, as the history relates, he was drawn away by Socrates from a house of bad fame  to the pursuits of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Nay, even the licentious life of Polemo, the successor of Xenocrates, will be a subject of reproach to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; whereas even in these instances we ought to regard it as a ground of praise, that reasoning was enabled, by the persuasive power of these men, to convert from the practice of such <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> those who had been formerly entangled by them. Now among the Greeks there was only one Ph&aelig;do, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not if there were a second, and one Polemo, who betook themselves to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, after a licentious and most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> life; while with Jesus there were not only at the time we speak of, the twelve <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but many more at all times, who, becoming a band of temperate men, speak in the following terms of their former lives: <q>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and pleasures, living in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kindness and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God our Saviour towards man appeared, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which He shed upon us richly,</q>  we became such as we are. For <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent forth His Word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions,</q>  as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> taught in the book of Psalms. And in addition to what has been already said, I would add the following: that Chrysippus, in his treatise on the <em>Cure of the Passions</em>, in his endeavours to restrain the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not pretending to determine what opinions are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> ones, says that according to the principles of the different <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> are those to be cured who have been brought under the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and continues: <q>And if pleasure be an end, then by it must the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> be healed; and if there be three kinds of chief blessings, still, according to this doctrine, it is in the same way that those are to be freed from their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> who are under their dominion;</q> whereas the assailants of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> do not see in how many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> have been brought under restraint, and the flood of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> checked, and savage manners softened, by means of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. So that it well became those who are ever boasting of their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the public good, to make a public acknowledgement of their thanks to that doctrine which by a new method led men to abandon many <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and to bear their testimony at least to it, that even though not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it has at all events been productive of benefit to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 65</h2>

<p>And since Jesus, in teaching His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> not to be guilty of rashness, gave them the precept, <q>If they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you in this city, flee into another; and if they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you in the other, flee again into a third,</q>  to which teaching He added the example of a consistent life, acting so as not to expose Himself to danger rashly, or unseasonably, or without good grounds; from this Celsus takes occasion to bring a malicious and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> accusation&mdash;the Jew whom he brings forward saying to Jesus, <q>In company with your <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> you go and hide yourself in different places.</q> Now similar to what has thus been made the ground of a <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> charge against Jesus and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, do we say was the conduct recorded of Aristotle. This <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, seeing that a court was about to be summoned to try him, on the ground of his being guilty of impiety on account of certain of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> tenets which the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> regarded as impious, withdrew from Athens, and fixed his school in Chalcis, defending his course of procedure to his friends by saying, <q>Let us depart from Athens, that we may not give the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> a handle for incurring guilt a second time, as formerly in the case of Socrates, and so prevent them from committing a second act of impiety against <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.</q> He further says, <q>that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went about with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and obtained His livelihood in a disgraceful and importunate manner.</q> Let him show wherein lay the disgraceful and importunate element in their manner of subsistence. For it is related in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, that there were certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who had been healed of their diseases, among whom also was Susanna, who from their own possessions afforded the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the means of support. And who is there among <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, that, when devoting himself to the service of his acquaintances, is not in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of receiving from them what is needful for his wants? Or is it only in them that such acts are proper and becoming; but when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> do the same, they are accused by Celsus of obtaining their livelihood by disgraceful importunity?</p>

<h2>Chapter 66</h2>

<p>And in addition to the above, this Jew of Celsus afterwards addresses Jesus: <q>What need, moreover, was there that you, while still an infant, should be conveyed into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>? Was it to escape being murdered? But then it was not likely that a God should be afraid of death; and yet an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came down from heaven, commanding you and your friends to flee, lest you should be captured and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>! And was not the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who had already sent two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> on your account, able to keep you, His only Son, there in safety?</q> From these words Celsus seems to think that there was no element of divinity in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, but that His body was not even such as is described in the fables of Homer; and with a taunt also at the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> which was shed upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, he adds that it was not</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Ichor, such as flows in the veins of the blessed gods.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>We now, believing Jesus Himself, when He says respecting His divinity, <q>I am the way, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life,</q>  and employs other terms of similar import; and when He says respecting His being clothed with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, <q>And now you seek to kill Me, a man that has told you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q>  conclude that He was a kind of compound being. And so it became Him who was making provision for His sojourning in the world as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, not to expose Himself unseasonably to the danger of death. And in like manner it was necessary that He should be taken away by His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, acting under the instructions of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven, who communicated to them the divine will, saying on the first occasion, <q>Joseph, you son of David, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not to take unto you Mary your wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>;</q>  and on the second, <q>Arise, and take the young Child, and His mother, and flee into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and be there until I bring you word: for <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> will seek the young Child to destroy Him.</q>  Now, what is recorded in these words appears to me to be not at all marvellous. For in either passage of Scripture it is stated that it was in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> spoke these words; and that in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may have certain things pointed out to them to do, is an event of frequent occurrence to many individuals,&mdash; the impression on the mind being produced either by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or by some other thing. Where, then, is the absurdity in believing that He who had once become incarnate, should be led also by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> guidance to keep out of the way of dangers? Not indeed from any impossibility that it should be otherwise, but from the moral fitness that ways and means should be made use of to ensure the safety of Jesus. And it was certainly better that the Child Jesus should escape the snare of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and should reside with His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> until the death of the conspirator, than that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> should hinder the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> in his wish to put the Child to death, or that the fabled poetic helmet of Hades should have been employed, or anything of a similar kind done with respect to Jesus, or that they who came to destroy Him should have been smitten with blindness like the people of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>. For the sending of help to Him in a very miraculous and unnecessarily public manner, would not have been of any service to Him who wished to show that as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to whom <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> was borne by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He possessed within that form which was seen by the eyes of men some higher element of divinity,&mdash; that which was properly the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>&mdash; the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wisdom of God&mdash; He who is called the Christ. But this is not a suitable occasion for discussing the composite nature of the incarnate Jesus; the investigation into such a subject being for <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, so to speak, a sort of private question.</p>

<h2>Chapter 67</h2>

<p>After the above, this Jew of Celsus, as if he were a Greek who loved learning, and were well instructed in Greek literature, continues: <q>The old mythological fables, which attributed a divine origin to Perseus, and Amphion, and &AElig;acus, and Minos, were not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by us. Nevertheless, that they might not appear unworthy of credit, they represented the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of these personages as great and wonderful, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> beyond the power of man; but what have you done that is noble or wonderful either in deed or in word? You have made no manifestation to us, although they challenged you in the temple to exhibit some unmistakeable sign that you were the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> In reply to which we have to say: Let the Greeks show to us, among those who have been enumerated, any one whose <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> have been marked by a utility and splendour extending to after generations, and which have been so great as to produce a belief in the fables which represented them as of divine descent. But these Greeks can show us nothing regarding those men of whom they speak, which is even inferior by a great degree to what Jesus did; unless they take us back to their fables and histories, wishing us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them without any reasonable grounds, and to discredit the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> accounts even after the clearest evidence. For we assert that the whole habitable world contains evidence of the works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of those Churches of God which have been founded through Him by those who have been converted from the practice of innumerable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.  And the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> can still remove distractions from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and expel <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and also take away diseases; and produce a marvellous meekness of spirit and complete change of character, and a humanity, and goodness, and gentleness in those individuals who do not feign themselves to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for the sake of subsistence or the supply of any mortal wants, but who have honestly accepted the doctrine concerning God and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the judgment to come.</p>

<h2>Chapter 68</h2>

<p>But after this, Celsus, having a suspicion that the great works performed by Jesus, of which we have named a few out of a great number, would be brought forward to view, affects to grant that those statements may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which are made regarding His cures, or His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, or the feeding of a multitude with a few loaves, from which many fragments remained over, or those other stories which Celsus thinks the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> have recorded as of a marvellous nature; and he adds: <q>Well, let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that these were actually wrought by you.</q> But then he immediately compares them to the tricks of jugglers, who profess to do more wonderful things, and to the feats performed by those who have been taught by Egyptians, who in the middle of the market-place, in return for a few obols, will impart the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their most venerated arts, and will expel <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> from men, and dispel diseases, and invoke the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of heroes, and exhibit expensive banquets, and tables, and dishes, and dainties having no real <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and who will put in motion, as if alive, what are not really living animals, but which have only the appearance of life. And he asks, <q>Since, then, these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can perform such feats, shall we of necessity conclude that they are 'sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,' or must we admit that they are the proceedings of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men under the influence of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit?</q> You see that by these expressions he allows, as it were, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of magic. I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, if he is the same who wrote several books against it. But, as it helped his purpose, he compares the (<a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>) related of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to the results produced by magic. There would indeed be a resemblance between them, if Jesus, like the dealers in magical arts, had performed His works only for show; but now there is not a single juggler who, by means of his proceedings, invites his spectators to reform their manners, or trains those to the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God who are amazed at what they see, nor who tries to persuade them so to live as men who are to be justified  by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And jugglers do none of these things, because they have neither the power nor the will, nor any desire to busy themselves about the reformation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, inasmuch as their own lives are full of the grossest and most notorious <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But how should not He who, by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which He did, induced those who beheld the excellent results to undertake the reformation of their characters, manifest Himself not only to His genuine <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but also to others, as a pattern of most <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life, in order that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> might devote themselves to the work of instructing men in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the others, after being more fully instructed by His word and character than by His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, as to how they were to direct their lives, might in all their conduct have a constant reference to the good pleasure of the universal God? And if such were the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, how could any one with reason compare Him with the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a>, and not, on the contrary, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, according to the promise, that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who appeared in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> to do good to our race?</p>

<h2>Chapter 69</h2>

<p>After this, Celsus, confusing together the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine and the opinions of some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, and bringing them forward as charges that were applicable to all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the divine word, says: <q>Such a body as yours could not have belonged to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Now, in answer to this, we have to say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, on entering into the world, assumed, as one born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, and one which was capable of suffering a natural death. For which reason, in addition to others, we say that He was also a great wrestler;  having, on account of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, been tempted in all respects like other men, but no longer as men, with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as a consequence, but being altogether without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is distinctly clear to us that <q>He did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither was guile found in His mouth; and as one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q>  God delivered Him up as pure for all who had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Then Celsus says: <q>The body of god would not have been so generated as you, O Jesus, were.</q> He saw, besides, that if, as it is written, it had been born, His body somehow might be even more divine than that of the multitude, and in a certain sense a body of god. But he disbelieves the accounts of His conception by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and believes that He was begotten by one Panthera, who corrupted the Virgin, <q>because a god's body would not have been so generated as you were.</q> But we have spoken of these matters at greater length in the preceding pages.</p>

<h2>Chapter 70</h2>

<p>He asserts, moreover, that <q>the body of a god is not nourished with such food (as was that of Jesus),</q> since he is able to prove from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narratives both that He partook of food, and food of a particular kind. Well, be it so. Let him assert that He ate the passover with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, when He not only used the words, <q>With desire have I desired to eat this passover with you,</q> but also actually partook of the same. And let him say also, that He experienced the sensation of thirst beside the well of Jacob, and drank of the water of the well. In what respect do these facts militate against what we have said respecting the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His body? Moreover, it appears indubitable that after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> He ate a piece of fish; for, according to our view, He assumed a (<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>) body, as one born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. <q>But,</q> objects Celsus, <q>the body of a god does not make use of such a voice as that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, nor employ such a method of persuasion as he.</q> These are, indeed, trifling and altogether contemptible objections. For our reply to him will be, that he who is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> among the Greeks to be a god, viz., the Pythian and Didymean Apollo, makes use of such a voice for his Pythian priestess at Delphi, and for his prophetess at Miletus; and yet neither the Pythian nor Didymean is charged by the Greeks with not being a god, nor any other Grecian deity whose worship is established in one place. And it was far better, surely, that a god should employ a voice which, on account of its being uttered with power, should produce an indescribable sort of persuasion in the minds of the hearers.</p>

<h2>Chapter 71</h2>

<p>Continuing to pour abuse upon Jesus as one who, on account of his impiety and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> opinions, was, so to speak, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he asserts that <q>these tenets of his were those of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and God-<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> sorcerer.</q> And yet, if the name and the thing be properly examined, it will be found an impossibility that man should be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing God loves all existing things, and <q><a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> nothing of what He has made,</q> for He created nothing in a spirit of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. And if certain expressions in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> convey such an impression, they are to be interpreted in accordance with the general principle by which Scripture employs such language with regard to God as if He were subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affections. But what reply need be made to him who, while professing to bring foreward credible statements, thinks himself bound to make use of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> against Jesus, as if He were a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> sorcerer? Such is not the procedure of one who seeks to make good his case, but of one who is in an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and unphilosophic state of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, inasmuch as the proper course is to state the case, and candidly to investigate it; and, according to the best of his ability, to bring forward what occurs to him with regard to it. But as the Jew of Celsus has, with the above remarks, brought to a close his charges against Jesus, so we also shall here bring to a termination the contents of our first book in reply to him. And if God bestow the gift of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which destroys all <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, agreeably to the words of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Cut them off in your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q>  we shall begin, in what follows, the consideration of the second appearance of the Jew, in which he is represented by Celsus as addressing those who have become converts to Jesus.</p>
