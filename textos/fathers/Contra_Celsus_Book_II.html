<h1>Contra Celsus, Book II</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>The first book of our answer to the treatise of Celsus, entitled <em>A True Discourse</em>, which concluded with the representation of the Jew addressing Jesus, having now extended to a sufficient length, we intend the present part as a reply to the charges brought by him against those who have been converted from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.  And we call attention, in the first place, to this special question, viz., why Celsus, when he had once resolved upon the introduction of individuals upon the stage of his book, did not represent the Jew as addressing the converts from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> rather than those from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, seeing that his discourse, if directed to us, would have appeared more likely to produce an impression.  But probably this claimant to universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is appropriate in the matter of such representations; and therefore let us proceed to consider what he has to say to the converts from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>. He asserts that <q>they have forsaken the law of their fathers, in consequence of their minds being led captive by Jesus; that they have been most ridiculously deceived, and that they have become deserters to another name and to another mode of life.</q> Here he has not observed that the Jewish converts have not deserted the law of their fathers, inasmuch as they live according to its prescriptions, receiving their very name from the poverty of the law, according to the literal acceptation of the word; for Ebion signifies <q>poor</q> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,  and those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who have received Jesus as Christ are called by the name of <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>. Nay, Peter himself seems to have observed for a considerable time the Jewish observances enjoined by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, not having yet learned from Jesus to ascend from the law that is regulated according to the letter, to that which is interpreted according to the spirit,&mdash; a fact which we learn from the Acts of the Apostles. For on the day after the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of God appeared to Cornelius, suggesting to him <q>to send to Joppa, to Simon surnamed Peter,</q> Peter <q>went up into the upper room to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> about the sixth hour. And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready he fell into a trance, and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth; wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean. And the voice spoke unto him again the second time, What God has cleansed, call not common.</q>  Now observe how, by this instance, Peter is represented as still observing the Jewish customs respecting clean and unclean animals. And from the narrative that follows, it is manifest that he, as being yet a Jew, and living according to their traditions, and despising those who were beyond the pale of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, stood in need of a vision to lead him to communicate to Cornelius (who was not an Israelite according to the flesh), and to those who were with him, the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Moreover, in the Epistle to the Galatians, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> states that Peter, still from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, ceased upon the arrival of James to eat with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and <q>separated himself from them, fearing them that were of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>;</q>  and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and Barnabas also, followed the same course. And certainly it was quite consistent that those should not abstain from the observance of Jewish usages who were sent to minister to the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, when they who <q>seemed to be pillars</q> gave the right hand of fellowship to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, in order that, while devoting themselves to the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, the latter might preach to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. And why do I mention that they who preached to the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> withdrew and separated themselves from the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, when even <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself <q>became as a Jew to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that he might gain the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</q> Wherefore also in the Acts of the Apostles it is related that he even brought an offering to the altar, that he might satisfy the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that he was no <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> from their law.  Now, if Celsus had been acquainted with all these circumstances, he would not have represented the Jew holding such language as this to the converts from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>: <q>What induced you, my fellow citizens, to abandon the law of your fathers, and to allow your minds to be led captive by him with whom we have just conversed, and thus be most ridiculously deluded, so as to become deserters from us to another name, and to the practices of another life?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>Now, since we are upon the subject of Peter, and of the teachers of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, I do not deem it out of place to quote a certain declaration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> taken from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John, and to give the explanation of the same. For it is there related that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said: <q>I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. Howbeit when He, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, has come, He will guide you into all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak.</q>  And when we inquire what were the <q>many things</q> referred to in the passage which Jesus had to say to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but which they were not then able to bear, I have to observe that, probably because the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and had been trained up according to the letter of the Mosaic law, He was unable to tell them what was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> law, and how the Jewish worship consisted in the pattern and shadow of certain heavenly things, and how future blessings were foreshadowed by the injunctions regarding meats and drinks, and festivals, and new moons, and sabbaths. These were many of the subjects which He had to explain to them; but as He saw that it was a work of exceeding difficulty to root out of the mind opinions that have been almost born with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and amid which he has been brought up till he reached the period of maturity, and which have produced in those who have adopted them the belief that they are divine, and that it is an act of impiety to overthrow them; and to demonstrate by the superiority of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine, that is, by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in a manner to convince the hearers, that such opinions were but <q>loss and dung,</q> He postponed such a task to a future season&mdash; to that, namely, which followed His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> and resurrection. For the bringing of aid unseasonably to those who were not yet capable of receiving it, might have overturned the idea which they had already formed of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and the Son of the living God. And see if there is not some well-grounded reason for such a statement as this, <q>I have many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now;</q> seeing there are many points in the law which require to be explained and cleared up in a spiritual sense, and these the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were in a manner unable to bear, having been born and brought up among <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. I am of opinion, moreover, that since these <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> were typical, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was that which was to be taught them by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, these words were added, <q>When He has come who is the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, He will lead you into all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;</q> as if He had said, into all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about those things which, being to you but types, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to constitute a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worship which you rendered unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And so, according to the promise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came to Peter, saying to him, with regard to the four-footed beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the air: <q>Arise, Peter; kill, and eat.</q> And the Spirit came to him while he was still in a state of superstitious <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; for he said, in answer to the divine command, <q>Not so Lord; for I have never yet eaten anything common or unclean.</q> He instructed him, however, in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and spiritual meaning of meats, by saying, <q>What God has cleansed, call not common.</q> And so, after that vision, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which conducted Peter into all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, told him the many things which he was unable to bear when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was still with him in the flesh. But I shall have another opportunity of explaining those matters, which are connected with the literal acceptation of the Mosaic law.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Our present object, however, is to expose the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of Celsus, who makes this Jew of his address his fellow-citizen and the Israelitish converts in the following manner: <q>What induced you to abandon the law of your fathers?</q> etc. Now, how should they have abandoned the law of their fathers, who are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of rebuking those who do not listen to its commands, saying, <q>Tell me, you who read the law, do you not hear the law? For it is written, that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had two sons;</q> and so on, down to the place, <q>which things are an allegory,</q>  etc.? And how have they abandoned the law of their fathers, who are ever speaking of the usages of their fathers in such words as these: <q>Or does not the law say these things also? For it is written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, You shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the grain. Does God care for oxen? Or says He it altogether for our sakes? For for our sakes it was written,</q> and so on?  Now, how confused is the reasoning of the Jew in regard to these matters (although he had it in his power to speak with greater effect) when he says: <q>Certain among you have abandoned the usages of our fathers under a pretence of explanations and allegories; and some of you, although, as you pretend, interpreting them in a spiritual manner, nevertheless do observe the customs of our fathers; and some of you, without any such interpretation, are willing to accept Jesus as the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and to keep the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> according to the customs of the fathers, as having in the words the whole mind of the Spirit.</q> Now how was Celsus able to see these things so clearly in this place, when in the subsequent parts of his work he makes mention of certain godless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> altogether alien from the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and even of others which leave the Creator out of account altogether, and does not appear to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there are <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> who are converts to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and who have not abandoned the law of their fathers? It was not his object to investigate everything here in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and to accept whatever he might find to be useful; but he composed these statements in the spirit of an enemy, and with a desire to overthrow everything as soon as he heard it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>The Jew, then, continues his address to converts from his own nation thus: <q>Yesterday and the day before, when we visited with punishment the man who deluded you, you became <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> from the law of your fathers;</q> showing by such statements (as we have just demonstrated) anything but an exact <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But what he advances afterwards seems to have some force, when he says: <q>How is it that you take the beginning of your system from our worship, and when you have made some progress you treat it with disrespect, although you have no other foundation to show for your doctrines than our law?</q> Now, certainly the introduction to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is through the Mosaic worship and the prophetic writings; and after the introduction, it is in the interpretation and explanation of these that progress takes place, while those who are introduced prosecute their investigations into <q>the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> according to revelation, which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,</q>  and by the appearance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. But they who advance in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> do not, as you allege, treat the things written in the law with disrespect. On the contrary, they bestow upon them greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, showing what a depth of wise and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> reasons is contained in these writings, which are not fully comprehended by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who treat them superficially, and as if they were in some degree even fabulous.  And what absurdity should there be in our system&mdash; that is, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>&mdash; having the law for its foundation, when even the Lord Jesus Himself said to those who would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> upon Him: <q>If you had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Me, for he wrote of Me. But if you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> his writings, how shall you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> My words?</q>  Nay, even one of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>&mdash; Mark&mdash; says: <q>The beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah, Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You,</q>  which shows that the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is connected with the Jewish writings. What force, then, is there in the objection of the Jew of Celsus, that <q>if any one predicted to us that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was to visit <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, he was one of our <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of our God?</q> Or how is it a charge against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, that John, who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Jesus, was a Jew? For although He was a Jew, it does not follow that every believer, whether a <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> or from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, must yield a literal <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>After these matters, although Celsus becomes tautological in his statements about Jesus, repeating for the second time that <q>he was punished by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for his crimes,</q> we shall not again take up the defence, being satisfied with what we have already said. But, in the next place, as this Jew of his disparages the doctrine regarding the resurrection of the dead, and the divine judgment, and of the rewards to be bestowed upon the just, and of the fire which is to devour the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, as being stale  opinions, and thinks that he will overthrow <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by asserting that there is nothing new in its teaching upon these points, we have to say to him, that our Lord, seeing the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> not to be at all in keeping with the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, inculcated by a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> that the kingdom of God would be taken from them, and given to the converts from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>. For which reason, now, we may also see of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that all the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the present day are mere trifles and fables,  since they have not the light that proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; whereas those of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, having power to raise and elevate the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and understanding of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and to persuade him to seek a citizenship, not like the earthly  <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> here below, but in heaven. And this result shows itself among those who are able to see the grandeur of the ideas contained in the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and who are able to commend them to others.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>But let it be granted that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> observed all the Jewish usages, including even their sacrificial observances, what does that avail to prevent our recognising Him as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? Jesus, then, is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who gave the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and we, who belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, do not transgress the law, but have escaped the mythologizings  of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and have our minds chastened and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the mystical <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> themselves, as not resting the sense of these words in the plain history which they relate, nor in the legal enactments taken according to the word and letter, express themselves somewhere, when about to relate histories, in words like this, <q>I will open my mouth in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, I will utter hard sayings of old;</q>  and in another place, when offering up a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> regarding the law as being obscure, and needing divine help for its comprehension, they offer up this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Your law.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>Moreover, let them show where there is to be found even the appearance of language dictated by arrogance  and proceeding from Jesus. For how could an arrogant man thus express himself, <q>Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart, and you shall find rest for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>?</q>  or how can He be styled arrogant, who after supper laid aside His garments in the presence of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and, after girding Himself with a towel, and pouring water into a basin, proceeded to wash the feet of each <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and rebuked him who was unwilling to allow them to be washed, with the words, <q>Except I wash you, you have no part with Me?</q>  Or how could He be called such who said, <q>I was among you, not as he that sits at meat, but as he that serves?</q>  And let any one show what were the falsehoods which He uttered, and let him point out what are great and what are small falsehoods, that he may prove Jesus to have been guilty of the former. And there is yet another way in which we may confute him. For as one <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> is not less or more false than another, so one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not less or more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> than another. And what charges of impiety he has to bring against Jesus, let the Jew of Celsus especially bring forward. Was it impious to abstain from corporeal <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and from a literal <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and literal festivals, and literal new moons, and from clean and unclean meats, and to turn the mind to the good and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and spiritual law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while at the same time he who was an ambassador for Christ <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to become to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as a Jew, that he might gain the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and to those who are under the law, as under the law, that he might gain those who are under the law?</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>He says, further, that <q>many other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> would appear such as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was, to those who were willing to be deceived.</q> Let this Jew of Celsus then show us, not many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, nor even a few, but a single individual, such as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was, introducing among the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, with the power that was manifested in Him, a system of doctrine and opinions beneficial to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, and which converts men from the practice of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. He says, moreover, that this charge is brought against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> converts, that they have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Jesus as in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now on this point we have, in the preceding pages, offered a preliminary defence, showing at the same time in what respects we understand Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in what we take Him to be man. <q>How should we,</q> he continues, <q>who have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that there is to come from God one who is to punish the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, treat him with disregard when he came?</q> And to this, as an exceedingly silly argument, it does not seem to me reasonable to offer any answer. It is as if some one were to say, <q>How could we, who teach <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, commit any act of licentiousness? Or we, who are ambassadors for righteousness, be guilty of any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>?</q> For as these inconsistencies are found among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so, to say that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> when speaking of the future advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and yet refused their belief to Him when He came, agreeably to prophetic statement, was quite in keeping with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And since we must add another reason, we shall remark that this very result was foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Isaiah distinctly declares: <q>Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive: for the heart of this people has become fat,</q>  etc. And let them explain why it was predicted to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that although they both heard and saw, they would not understand what was said, nor perceive what was seen as they ought. For it is indeed manifest, that when they beheld Jesus they did not see who He was; and when they heard Him, they did not understand from His words the divinity that was in Him, and which transferred God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> care, hitherto exercised over the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to His converts from the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. Therefore we may see, that after the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were altogether abandoned, and possess now none of what were considered their ancient glories, so that there is no indication of any Divinity abiding among them. For they have no longer <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> nor <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, traces of which to a considerable extent are still found among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and some of them more remarkable than any that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and these we ourselves have witnessed, if our testimony may be received.  But the Jew of Celsus exclaims: <q>Why did we treat him, whom we announced beforehand, with dishonour? Was it that we might be chastised more than others?</q> To which we have to answer, that on account of their unbelief, and the other insults which they heaped upon Jesus, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> will not only suffer more than others in that judgment which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to impend over the world, but have even already endured such sufferings. For what nation is an exile from their own metropolis, and from the place sacred to the worship of their fathers, save the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> alone? And these calamities they have suffered, because they were a most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> nation, which, although guilty of many other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, yet has been punished so severely for none, as for those that were committed against our Jesus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>The Jew continues his discourse thus: <q>How should we deem him to be a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who not only in other respects, as was currently reported, performed none of his promises, but who also, after we had convicted him, and condemned him as deserving of punishment, was found attempting to conceal himself, and endeavouring to escape in a most disgraceful manner, and who was betrayed by those whom he called <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>? And yet,</q> he continues, <q>he who was a God could neither flee nor be led away a prisoner; and least of all could he be deserted and delivered up by those who had been his associates, and had shared all things in common, and had had him for their teacher, who was deemed to be a Saviour, and a son of the greatest <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.</q> To which we reply, that even we do not suppose the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, which was then an object of sight and perception, to have been God. And why do I say His body? Nay, not even His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, of which it is related, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.</q>  But as, according to the Jewish manner of speaking, <q>I am the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all flesh,</q> and, <q>Before Me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after Me,</q> God is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be He who employs the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> as an instrument; and as, according to the Greeks, he who says,</p>

<blockquote><p>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both the number of the sand, and the measures of the sea,
<br>And I understand a dumb man, and hear him who does not speak, 
</p></blockquote>

<p>is considered to be a god when speaking, and making himself heard through the Pythian priestess; so, according to our view, it was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things, who spoke in Jesus these words, <q>I am the way, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life;</q> and these, <q>I am the door;</q> and these, <q>I am the living bread that came down from heaven;</q> and other expressions similar to these. We therefore charge the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> with not acknowledging Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom testimony was borne in many passages by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, to the effect that He was a mighty power, and a God next to  the God and Father of all things. For we assert that it was to Him the Father gave the command, when in the Mosaic account of the creation He uttered the words, <q>Let there be light,</q> and <q>Let there be a firmament,</q> and gave the injunctions with regard to those other creative acts which were performed; and that to Him also were addressed the words, <q>Let Us make man in Our own image and likeness;</q> and that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, when commanded, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> all the Father's will. And we make these statements not from our own conjectures, but because we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the prophecies circulated among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in which it is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of the works of creation, in express words, as follows: <q>He spoke, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.</q>  Now if God gave the command, and the creatures were formed, who, according to the view of the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, could He be that was able to carry out such commands of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, save Him who, so to speak, is the living <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> and the Truth? And that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> do not consider him who in Jesus said these words, <q>I am the way, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life,</q> to have been of so circumscribed a nature  as to have an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> nowhere out of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, is evident both from many considerations, and from a few instances of the following kind which we shall quote. John the Baptist, when predicting that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was to appear immediately, not in that body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but as manifesting Himself everywhere, says regarding Him: <q>There stands in the midst of you One whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, who comes after me.</q>  For if he had thought that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was only there, where was the visible body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, how could he have said, <q>There stands in the midst of you One whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not?</q> And Jesus Himself, in raising the minds of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to higher thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, says: <q>Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of you.</q>  And of the same nature is His promise to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.</q>  And we quote these passages, making no distinction between the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and Jesus. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> formed, after the <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F30;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, one being with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now if, according to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> teaching, <q>he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit,</q>  every one who understands what being joined to the Lord is, and who has been actually joined to Him, is one spirit with the Lord; how should not that being be one in a far greater and more divine degree, which was once united with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> of God?  He, indeed, manifested Himself among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which He performed, which Celsus suspected were accomplished by sorcery, but which by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of that time were attributed I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not why, to <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, in the words: <q>He casts out devils through <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, the prince of the devils.</q>  But these our Saviour convicted of uttering the greatest absurdities, from the fact that the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was not yet come to an end. And this will be evident to all intelligent readers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narrative, which it is not now the time to explain.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>But what promise did Jesus make which He did not perform? Let Celsus produce any instance of such, and make good his charge. But he will be unable to do so, especially since it is from mistakes, arising either from misapprehension of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narratives, or from Jewish stories, that he thinks to derive the charges which he brings against Jesus or against ourselves. Moreover, again, when the Jew says, <q>We both found him guilty, and condemned him as deserving of death,</q> let them show how they who sought to concoct false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against Him <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Him to be guilty. Was not the great charge against Jesus, which His accusers brought forward, this, that He said, <q>I am able to destroy the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and after three days to raise it up again?</q>  But in so saying, He spoke of the temple of His body; while they thought, not being able to understand the meaning of the speaker, that His reference was to the temple of stone, which was treated by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> with greater respect than He was who ought to have been honoured as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Temple of God&mdash; the Word, and the Wisdom, and the Truth. And who can say that <q>Jesus attempted to make His escape by disgracefully concealing Himself?</q> Let any one point to an act deserving to be called disgraceful. And when he adds, <q>he was taken prisoner,</q> I would say that, if to be taken prisoner implies an act done against one's will, then Jesus was not taken prisoner; for at the fitting time He did not prevent Himself falling into the hands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He might take away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world. For, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all things that were to come upon Him, He went forth, and said to them, <q>Whom do you seek?</q> and they answered, <q><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>;</q> and He said unto them, <q>I am He.</q> And Judas also, who betrayed Him, was standing with them. When, therefore, He had said to them, <q>I am He,</q> they went backwards and fell to the ground. Again He asked them, <q>Whom do you seek?</q> and they said again, <q><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>.</q> Jesus said to them, <q>I told you I am He; if then you seek Me, let these go away.</q>  Nay, even to Him who wished to help Him, and who smote the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest's</a> servant, and cut off his ear, He said: <q>Put up your sword into its sheath: for all they who draw the sword shall perish by the sword. Do you think that I cannot even now <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to My Father, and He will presently give Me more than twelve legions of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>? But how then should the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</q>  And if any one imagines these statements to be inventions of the writers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, why should not those statements rather be regarded as inventions which proceeded from a spirit of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and hostility against Jesus and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? And these the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which proceed from those who manifest the sincerity of their feelings towards Jesus, by enduring everything, whatever it may be, for the sake of His words? For the reception by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of such power of endurance and resolution continued even to death, with a disposition of mind that would not invent regarding their Teacher what was not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is a very evident <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to all candid judges that they were fully persuaded of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of what they wrote, seeing they submitted to trials so numerous and so severe, for the sake of Him whom they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>In the next place, that He was betrayed by those whom He called His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, is a circumstance which the Jew of Celsus learned from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>; calling the one Judas, however, <q>many <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</q> that he might seem to add force to the accusation. Nor did he trouble himself to take note of all that is related concerning Judas; how this Judas, having come to entertain opposite and conflicting opinions regarding his Master neither opposed Him with his whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nor yet with his whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> preserved the respect due by a pupil to his teacher. For he that betrayed Him gave to the multitude that came to apprehend Jesus, a sign, saying, <q>Whomsoever I shall <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, it is he; seize him,</q>&mdash; retaining still some element of respect for his Master: for unless he had done so, he would have betrayed Him, even publicly, without any pretence of affection. This circumstance, therefore, will satisfy all with regard to the purpose of Judas, that along with his <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> disposition, and his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> design to betray his Master, he had still a feeling of a mixed character in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, produced in him by the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, which had the appearance (so to speak) of some remnant of good. For it is related that, <q>when Judas, who betrayed Him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He was condemned, he repented, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and elders, saying, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? You see to that;</q> &mdash; and that, having thrown the money down in the temple, he departed, and went and hanged himself. But if this <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> Judas, who also stole the money placed in the bag for the relief of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, repented, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and elders, it is clear that the instructions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had been able to produce some feeling of repentance in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and were not altogether despised and loathed by this traitor. Nay, the declaration, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood,</q> was a public acknowledgment of his crime. Observe, also, how exceedingly passionate  was the sorrow for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that proceeded from that repentance, and which would not suffer him any longer to live; and how, after he had cast the money down in the temple, he withdrew, and went away and hanged himself: for he passed sentence upon himself, showing what a power the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had over this sinner Judas, this thief and traitor, who could not always treat with contempt what he had learned from Jesus. Will Celsus and his friends now say that those <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> which show that the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> of Judas was not a complete <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, even after his attempts against his Master, are inventions, and that this alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, viz., that one of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> betrayed Him; and will they add to the Scriptural account that he betrayed Him also with his whole heart? To act in this spirit of hostility with the same writings, both as to what we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and what we are not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, is absurd.  And if we must make a statement regarding Judas which may overwhelm our opponents with shame, we would say that, in the book of Psalms, the whole of the <a href="../bible/psa107.htm">108th</a> contains a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> about Judas, the beginning of which is this: <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hold not Your peace before my praise; for the mouth of the sinner, and the mouth of the crafty man, are opened against me.</q>  And it is predicted in this psalm, both that Judas separated himself from the number of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> on account of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and that another was selected in his place; and this is shown by the words: <q>And his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> let another take.</q>  But suppose now that He had been betrayed by some one of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who was possessed by a worse spirit than Judas, and who had completely poured out, as it were, all the words which he had heard from Jesus, what would this contribute to an accusation against Jesus or the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>? And how will this demonstrate its doctrine to be false? We have replied in the preceding chapter to the statements which follow this, showing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not taken prisoner when attempting to flee, but that He gave Himself up voluntarily for the sake of us all. Whence it follows, that even if He were bound, He was bound agreeably to His own will; thus teaching us the lesson that we should undertake similar things for the sake of religion in no spirit of unwillingness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>And the following appear to me to be childish assertions, viz., that <q>no good general and leader of great multitudes was ever betrayed; nor even a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> captain of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> and commander of very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, who seemed to be of any use to his associates; but Jesus, having been betrayed by his subordinates, neither governed like a good general, nor, after deceiving his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, produced in the minds of the victims of his deceit that feeling of good-will which, so to speak, would be manifested towards a brigand chief.</q> Now one might find many accounts of generals who were betrayed by their own soldiers, and of robber chiefs who were captured through the instrumentality of those who did not keep their bargains with them. But grant that no general or robber chief was ever betrayed, what does that contribute to the establishment of the fact as a charge against Jesus, that one of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> became His betrayer? And since Celsus makes an ostentatious exhibition of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, I would ask of him, If, then, it was a charge against <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, that Aristotle, after being his pupil for twenty years, went away and assailed his doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and styled the ideas of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> the merest trifling?  And if I were still in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, I would continue thus: Was <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> no longer mighty in dialectics, nor able to defend his views, after Aristotle had taken his departure; and, on that account, are the opinions of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> false? Or may it not be, that while <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as the pupils of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> would maintain, Aristotle was guilty of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and ingratitude towards his teacher? Nay, Chrysippus also, in many places of his writings, appears to assail Cleanthes, introducing novel opinions opposed to his views, although the latter had been his teacher when he was a young man, and began the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Aristotle, indeed, is said to have been <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> pupil for twenty years, and no inconsiderable period was spent by Chrysippus in the school of Cleanthes; while Judas did not remain so much as three years with Jesus.  But from the narratives of the lives of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> we might take many instances similar to those on which Celsus founds a charge against Jesus on account of Judas. Even the Pythagoreans erected cenotaphs  to those who, after betaking themselves to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, fell back again into their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> mode of life; and yet neither was Pythagoras nor his followers, on that account, weak in argument and demonstration.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>This Jew of Celsus continues, after the above, in the following fashion: <q>Although he could state many things regarding the events of the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> which are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and not like those which are recorded by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, he willingly omits them.</q> What, then, are those <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> statements, unlike the accounts in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, which the Jew of Celsus passes by without mention? Or is he only employing what appears to be a figure of speech,  in pretending to have something to say, while in reality he had nothing to produce beyond the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narrative which could impress the hearer with a feeling of its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and furnish a clear ground of accusation against Jesus and His doctrine? And he charges the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with having invented the statement that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> foreknew and foretold all that happened to Him; but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this statement we shall establish, although Celsus may not like it, by means of many other predictions uttered by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, in which He foretold what would befall the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in after generations. And who is there who would not be astonished at this prediction: <q>You shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony against them and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>;</q>  and at any others which He may have delivered respecting the future <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>? For what system of opinions ever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> on account of which others are punished, so that any one of the accusers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> could say that, foreseeing the impiety or falsity of his opinions to be the ground of an accusation against them he thought that this would redound to his credit, that he had so predicted regarding it long before? Now if any deserve to be brought, on account of their opinions, before governors and kings, what others are they, save the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, who altogether deny the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>? And also the Peripatetics, who say that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are of no avail, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered as to the Divinity? But some one will say that the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> because of their religion. In answer to whom we shall state that the Sicarians,  on account of the practice of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, as mutilating themselves contrary to the established <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and the customs permitted to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> alone, are <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. And you never hear a judge inquiring whether a Sicarian who strives to live according to this established religion of his will be released from punishment if he apostatizes, but will be led away to death if he continues  firm; for the evidence of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is sufficient to ensure the death of him who has undergone it. But <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> alone, according to the prediction of their Saviour, <q>You shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake,</q> are urged up to their last breath by their judges to deny <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> according to the public customs; and after the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of abjuration, to return to their homes, and to live in safety. And observe whether it is not with great authority that this declaration is uttered: <q>Whosoever therefore shall confess Me before men, him will I confess also before My Father who is in heaven. And whosoever shall deny Me before men,</q>  etc. And go back with me in thought to Jesus when He uttered these words, and see His predictions not yet accomplished. Perhaps you will say, in a spirit of incredulity, that he is talking folly, and speaking to no purpose, for his words will have no fulfilment; or, being in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about assenting to his words, you will say, that if these predictions be fulfilled, and the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> be established, so that governors and kings think of destroying those who acknowledge Jesus, then we shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he utters these prophecies as one who has received great power from God to implant this doctrine among the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and as believing that it will prevail. And who will not be filled with wonder, when he goes back in thought to Him who then taught and said, <q>This <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> shall be preached throughout the whole world, for a testimony against them and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q>  and beholds, agreeably to His words, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> preached in the whole world under heaven to Greeks and Barbarians, wise and foolish alike? For the word, spoken with power, has gained the mastery over men of all sorts of nature, and it is impossible to see any race of men which has escaped accepting the teaching of Jesus. But let this Jew of Celsus, who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He foreknew all that happened to Him, consider how, while Jerusalem was still standing, and the whole Jewish worship celebrated in it, Jesus foretold what would befall it from the hand of the Romans. For they will not maintain that the acquaintances and pupils of Jesus Himself handed down His teaching contained in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> without committing it to writing, and left His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> without the memoirs of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> contained in their works.  Now in these it is recorded, that <q>when you shall see Jerusalem compassed about with armies, then shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the desolation thereof is near.</q>  But at that time there were no armies around Jerusalem, encompassing and enclosing and besieging it; for the siege began in the reign of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, and lasted till the government of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, whose son Titus destroyed Jerusalem, on account, as <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> says, of <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the Just</a>, the brother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who was called Christ, but in reality, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> makes clear, on account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>Celsus, however, accepting or granting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> foreknew what would befall Him, might think to make light of the admission, as he did in the case of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, when he alleged that they were wrought by means of sorcery; for he might say that many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, either by auspices, or auguries, or <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, or nativities, have come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what was to happen. But this concession he would not make, as being too great a one; and although he somehow granted that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, he thought to weaken the force of this by the charge of sorcery. Now Phlegon, in the thirteenth or fourteenth book, I think, of his Chronicles, not only ascribed to Jesus a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of future events (although falling into confusion about some things which refer to Peter, as if they referred to Jesus), but also testified that the result corresponded to His predictions. So that he also, by these very admissions regarding foreknowledge, as if against his will, expressed his opinion that the doctrines taught by the fathers of our system were not devoid of divine power.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>Celsus continues: <q>The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, having no undoubted fact on which to rely, devised the fiction that he foreknew everything before it happened;</q> not observing, or not wishing to observe, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which actuated the writers, who acknowledged that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had told His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> beforehand, <q>All you shall be offended because of Me this night,</q>&mdash; a statement which was fulfilled by their all being offended; and that He predicted to Peter, <q>Before the cock crow, you shall deny Me thrice,</q> which was followed by Peter's threefold denial. Now if they had not been lovers of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but, as Celsus supposes, inventors of fictions, they would not have represented Peter as denying, nor His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as being offended. For although these events actually happened, who could have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that they turned out in that manner? And yet, according to all probability, these were matters which ought to have been passed over in silence by men who wished to teach the readers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> to despise death for the sake of confessing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. But now, seeing that the word, by its power, will gain the mastery over men, they related those facts which they have done, and which, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how, were neither to do any harm to their readers, nor to afford any pretext for denial.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p>Exceedingly weak is his assertion, that <q>the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> wrote such accounts regarding him, by way of extenuating the charges that told against him: as if,</q> he says, <q>any one were to say that a certain person was a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, and yet were to show that he was guilty of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; or that he was <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and yet had committed <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>; or that he was <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and yet was dead; subjoining to all these statements the remark that he had foretold all these things.</q> Now his illustrations are at once seen to be inappropriate; for there is no absurdity in Him who had resolved that He would become a living pattern to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as to the manner in which they were to regulate their lives, showing also how they ought to die for the sake of their religion, apart altogether from the fact that His death on behalf of men was a benefit to the whole world, as we <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the preceding book. He imagines, moreover, that the whole of the confession of the Saviour's sufferings confirms his objection instead of weakening it. For he is not acquainted either with the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> remarks of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,  or the statements of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, on this subject. And it escaped him that certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have declared that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> underwent His sufferings in appearance, not in reality. For had he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, he would not have said: <q>For you do not even allege this, that he seemed to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men to suffer this punishment, though not undergoing it in reality; but, on the contrary, you acknowledge that he openly suffered.</q> But we do not view His sufferings as having been merely in appearance, in order that His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> also may not be a false, but a real event. For he who really died, actually arose, if he did arise; whereas he who appeared only to have died, did not in reality arise. But since the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is a subject of mockery to unbelievers, we shall quote the words of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>,  that Erus the son of Armenius rose from the funeral pile twelve days after he had been laid upon it, and gave an account of what he had seen in Hades; and as we are replying to unbelievers, it will not be altogether useless to refer in this place to what Heraclides  relates respecting the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was deprived of life. And many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are recorded to have risen from their tombs, not only on the day of their burial, but also on the day following. What wonder is it, then, if in the case of One who performed many marvellous things, both beyond the power of man and with such fullness of evidence, that he who could not deny their performance, endeavoured to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> them by comparing them to acts of sorcery, should have manifested also in His death some greater display of divine power, so that His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, if it pleased, might leave its body, and having performed certain offices out of it, might return again at pleasure? And such a declaration is Jesus said to have made in the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Gospel of John</a>, when He said: <q>No man takes My life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</q>  And perhaps it was on this account that He hastened His departure from the body, that He might preserve it, and that His legs might not be broken, as were those of the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> who were crucified with Him. <q>For the soldiers broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with Him; but when they came to Jesus, and saw that He was dead, they broke not His legs.</q>  We have accordingly answered the question, <q>How is it credible that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> could have predicted these things?</q> And with respect to this, <q>How could the dead man be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>?</q> let him who wishes to understand <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that it is not the dead man who is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, but He who rose from the dead. So far, indeed, was the dead man from being <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, that even the Jesus before His decease&mdash; the compound being, who was to suffer death&mdash; was not <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.  For no one is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> who is destined to die; but he is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> when he shall no longer be subject to death. But <q>Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more: death has no more dominion over Him;</q>  although those may be unwilling to admit this who cannot understand how such things should be said.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>Extremely foolish also is his remark, <q>What god, or spirit, or <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man would not, on foreseeing that such events were to befall him, avoid them if he could; whereas he threw himself headlong into those things which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> beforehand were to happen?</q> And yet Socrates <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he would die after drinking the hemlock, and it was in his power, if he had allowed himself to be persuaded by Crito, by escaping from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, to avoid these calamities; but nevertheless he decided, as it appeared to him consistent with right reason, that it was better for him to die as became a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, than to retain his life in a manner unbecoming one. Leonidas also, the Laced&aelig;monian general, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he was on the point of dying with his followers at Thermopyl&aelig;, did not make any effort to preserve his life by disgraceful means but said to his companions, <q>Let us go to breakfast, as we shall sup in Hades.</q> And those who are interested in collecting stories of this kind will find numbers of them. Now, where is the wonder if Jesus, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all things that were to happen, did not avoid them, but encountered what He foreknew; when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, His own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, having heard what would befall him when he went up to Jerusalem, proceeded to face the danger, reproaching those who were weeping around him, and endeavouring to prevent him from going up to Jerusalem? Many also of our contemporaries, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> well that if they made a confession of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> they would be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, but that if they denied it they would be liberated, and their property restored, despised life, and voluntarily selected death for the sake of their religion.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p>After this the Jew makes another silly remark, saying, <q>How is it that, if Jesus pointed out beforehand both the traitor and the <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjurer</a>, they did not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> him as a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and cease, the one from his intended treason, and the other from his <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>?</q> Here the learned Celsus did not see the contradiction in his statement: for if Jesus foreknew events as a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then it was impossible for His foreknowledge to prove untrue; and therefore it was impossible for him who was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Him as going to betray Him not to execute his purpose, nor for him who was rebuked as going to deny Him not to have been guilty of that crime. For if it had been possible for the one to abstain from the act of betrayal, and the other from that of denial, as having been warned of the consequences of these actions beforehand, then His words were no longer <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, who predicted that the one would betray Him and the other deny Him. For if He had foreknowledge of the traitor, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in which the treason originated, and this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> was by no means taken away by the foreknowledge. And, again, if He had ascertained that one would deny Him, He made that prediction from seeing the weakness out of which that act of denial would arise, and yet this weakness was not to be taken away thus at once  by the foreknowledge. But whence he derived the statement, <q>that these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> betrayed and denied him without manifesting any concern about him,</q> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; for it was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, with respect to the traitor, that it is false to say that he betrayed his master without an exhibition of anxiety regarding Him. And this was shown to be equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of him who denied Him; for he went out, after the denial, and wept bitterly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p>Superficial also is his objection, that <q>it is always the case when a man against whom a plot is formed, and who comes to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it, makes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the conspirators that he is acquainted with their design, that the latter are turned from their purpose, and keep upon their guard.</q> For many have continued to plot even against those who were acquainted with their plans. And then, as if bringing his argument to a conclusion, he says: <q>Not because these things were predicted did they come to pass, for that is impossible; but since they have come to pass, their being predicted is shown to be a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>: for it is altogether impossible that those who heard beforehand of the discovery of their designs, should carry out their plans of betrayal and denial!</q> But if his premises are overthrown, then his conclusion also falls to the ground, viz., <q>that we are not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because these things were predicted, that they have come to pass.</q> Now we maintain that they not only came to pass as being possible, but also that, because they came to pass, the fact of their being predicted is shown to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> regarding future events is judged of by results. It is false, therefore, as asserted by him, that the prediction of these events is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be untrue; and it is to no purpose that he says, <q>It is altogether impossible for those who heard beforehand that their designs were discovered, to carry out their plans of betrayal and denial.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p>Let us see how he continues after this: <q>These events,</q> he says, <q>he predicted as being a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the prediction must by all means come to pass. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, who above all others ought to do good to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and especially to those of his own household, led on his own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, with whom he was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of eating and drinking, to such a degree of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that they became impious and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> men. Now, of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he who shared a man's table would not be guilty of conspiring against him; but after banqueting with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he became a conspirator. And, what is still more absurd, God himself plotted against the members of his own table, by converting them into traitors and villains!</q> Now, since you wish me to answer even those charges of Celsus which seem to me frivolous,  the following is our reply to such statements. Celsus imagines that an event, predicted through foreknowledge, comes to pass because it was predicted; but we do not grant this, maintaining that he who foretold it was not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its happening, because he foretold it would happen; but the future event itself, which would have taken place though not predicted, afforded the occasion to him, who was endowed with foreknowledge, of foretelling its occurrence. Now, certainly this result is present to the foreknowledge of him who predicts an event, when it is possible that it may or may not happen, viz., that one or other of these things will take place. For we do not assert that he who foreknows an event, by secretly taking away the possibility of its happening or not, makes any such declaration as this: <q>This shall infallibly happen, and it is impossible that it can be otherwise.</q> And this remark applies to all the foreknowledge of events dependent upon ourselves, whether contained in the sacred Scriptures or in the histories of the Greeks. Now, what is called by logicians an <q>idle argument,</q>  which is a sophism, will be no sophism as far as Celsus can help, but according to sound reasoning it is a sophism. And that this may be seen, I shall take from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> the predictions regarding Judas, or the foreknowledge of our Saviour regarding him as the traitor; and from the Greek histories the oracle that was given to Laius, conceding for the present its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since it does not affect the argument. Now, in <a href="../bible/psa107.htm">Ps. cviii</a>., Judas is spoken of by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, in words beginning thus: <q>Hold not Your peace, O God of my praise; for the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me.</q> Now, if you carefully observe the contents of the psalm, you will find that, as it was foreknown that he would betray the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, so also was he considered to be himself the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the betrayal, and deserving, on account of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, of the imprecations contained in the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. For let him suffer these things, <q>because,</q> says the psalmist, <q>he remembered not to show mercy, but <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the poor and needy man.</q> Wherefore it was possible for him to show mercy, and not to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> him whom he did <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a>. But although he might have done these things, he did not do them, but carried out the act of treason, so as to merit the curses pronounced against him in the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.</p>

<p>And in answer to the Greeks we shall quote the following oracular response to Laius, as recorded by the tragic poet, either in the exact words of the oracle or in equivalent terms. Future events are thus made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him by the oracle: <q>Do not try to beget children against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the gods. For if you beget a son, your son shall <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> you; and all your household shall wade in blood.</q>  Now from this it is clear that it was within the power of Laius not to try to beget children, for the oracle would not have commanded an impossibility; and it was also in his power to do the opposite, so that neither of these courses was compulsory. And the consequence of his not guarding against the begetting of children was, that he suffered from so doing the calamities described in the tragedies relating to &OElig;dipus and Jocasta and their sons. Now that which is called the <q>idle argument,</q> being a quibble, is such as might be applied, say in the case of a sick man, with the view of sophistically preventing him from employing a physician to promote his recovery; and it is something like this: <q>If it is decreed that you should recover from your disease, you will recover whether you call in a physician or not; but if it is decreed that you should not recover, you will not recover whether you call in a physician or no. But it is certainly decreed either that you should recover, or that you should not recover; and therefore it is in vain that you call in a physician.</q> Now with this argument the following may be wittily compared: <q>If it is decreed that you should beget children, you will beget them, whether you have intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> or not. But if it is decreed that you should not beget children, you will not do so, whether you have intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> or no. Now, certainly, it is decreed either that you should beget children or not; therefore it is in vain that you have intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> For, as in the latter instance, intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is not employed in vain, seeing it is an utter impossibility for him who does not use it to beget children; so, in the former, if recovery from disease is to be accomplished by means of the healing art, of necessity the physician is summoned, and it is therefore false to say that <q>in vain do you call in a physician.</q> We have brought forward all these illustrations on account of the assertion of this learned Celsus, that <q>being a God He predicted these things, and the predictions must <em>by all means</em> come to pass.</q> Now, if by <q> <em>by all means</em></q> he means <q> <em>necessarily</em>,</q> we cannot admit this. For it was quite possible, also, that they might <em>not</em> come to pass. But if he uses <q> <em>by all means</em></q> in the sense of <q> <em>simple futurity</em>,</q>  which nothing hinders from being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> (although it was possible that they might not happen), he does not at all touch my argument; nor did it follow, from Jesus having predicted the acts of the traitor or the <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjurer</a>, that it was the same thing with His being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of such impious and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> proceedings. For He who was among us, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was in man, seeing his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition, and foreseeing what he would attempt from his spirit of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and from his want of stable ideas of duty towards his Master, along with many other declarations, gave utterance to this also: <q>He that dips his hand with Me in the dish, the same shall betray Me.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p>Observe also the superficiality and manifest falsity of such a statement of Celsus, when he asserts <q>that he who was partaker of a man's table would not conspire against him; and if he would not conspire against a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, much less would he plot against a God after banqueting with him.</q> For who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, after partaking of the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> on the table,  have entered into a conspiracy against their entertainers? The whole of Greek and Barbarian history is full of such instances. And the Iambic poet of Paros,  when upbraiding Lycambes with having violated covenants confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the table, says to him:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>But you have broken a mighty <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>&mdash; that, viz., by the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the table.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And they who are interested in historical learning, and who give themselves wholly to it, to the neglect of other branches of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> more necessary for the conduct of life,  can quote numerous instances, showing that they who shared in the hospitality of others entered into conspiracies against them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p>He adds to this, as if he had brought together an argument with conclusive demonstrations and consequences, the following: <q>And, which is still more absurd, God himself conspired against those who sat at his table, by converting them into traitors and impious men.</q> But how Jesus could either conspire or convert His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> into traitors or impious men, it would be impossible for him to prove, save by means of such a deduction as any one could refute with the greatest ease.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p>He continues in this strain: <q>If he had determined upon these things, and underwent chastisement in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to his Father, it is manifest that, being a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and submitting voluntarily, those things that were done agreeably to his own decision were neither painful nor distressing.</q> But he did not observe that here he was at once contradicting himself. For if he granted that He was chastised because He had determined upon these things, and had submitted Himself to His Father, it is clear that He actually suffered punishment, and it was impossible that what was inflicted on Him by His chastisers should not be painful, because pain is an involuntary thing. But if, because He was willing to suffer, His inflictions were neither painful nor distressing, how did He grant that <q>He was chastised?</q> He did not perceive that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had once, by His birth, assumed a body, He assumed one which was capable both of suffering pains, and those distresses incidental to humanity, if we are to understand by distresses what no one voluntarily chooses. Since, therefore, He voluntarily assumed a body, not wholly of a different nature from that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, so along with His body He assumed also its sufferings and distresses, which it was not in His power to avoid enduring, it being in the power of those who inflicted them to send upon Him things distressing and painful. And in the preceding pages we have already shown, that He would not have come into the hands of men had He not so willed. But He did come, because He was willing to come, and because it was manifest beforehand that His dying upon behalf of men would be of advantage to the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p>After this, wishing to prove that the occurrences which befell Him were painful and distressing, and that it was impossible for Him, had He wished, to render them otherwise, he proceeds: <q>Why does he mourn, and lament, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to escape the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, expressing himself in terms like these: 'O Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me?'</q>  Now in these words observe the malignity of Celsus, how not accepting the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which actuates the writers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> (who might have passed over in silence those points which, as Celsus thinks, are censurable, but who did not omit them for many reasons, which any one, in expounding the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, can give in their proper place), he brings an accusation against the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> statement, grossly exaggerating the facts, and quoting what is not written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, seeing it is nowhere found that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> lamented. And he changes the words in the expression, <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me,</q> and does not give what follows immediately after, which manifests at once the ready <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to His Father, and His greatness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and which runs thus: <q>Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.</q>  Nay, even the cheerful <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of His Father in those things which He was condemned to suffer, exhibited in the declaration, <q>If this cup cannot pass from Me except I drink it, Your will be done,</q> he pretends not to have observed, acting here like those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> individuals who listen to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> in a malignant spirit, and <q>who talk <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> with lofty head.</q> For they appear to have heard the declaration, <q>I kill,</q>  and they often make it to us a subject of reproach; but the words, <q>I will make alive,</q> they do not remember&mdash;the whole sentence showing that those who live amid public <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and who work wickedly, are <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that a better life is infused into them instead, even one which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will give to those who have died to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And so also these men have heard the words, <q>I will smite;</q> but they do not see these, <q>and I will heal,</q> which are like the words of a physician, who cuts bodies asunder, and inflicts severe wounds, in order to extract from them substances that are injurious and prejudicial to health, and who does not terminate his work with pains and lacerations, but by his treatment restores the body to that state of soundness which he has in view. Moreover, they have not heard the whole of the announcement, <q>For He makes sore, and again binds up;</q> but only this part, <q>He makes sore.</q> So in like manner acts this Jew of Celsus who quotes the words, <q>O Father, would that this cup might pass from Me;</q> but who does not add what follows, and which exhibits the firmness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and His preparedness for suffering. But these matters, which afford great room for explanation from the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which may reasonably be pondered over  by those whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> calls <q>perfect</q> when he said, <q>We speak wisdom among them who are perfect,</q>  we pass by for the present, and shall speak for a little of those matters which are useful for our present purpose.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p>We have mentioned in the preceding pages that there are some of the declarations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> which refer to that Being in Him which was the <q><a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature,</q> such as, <q>I am the way, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life,</q> and such like; and others, again, which belong to that in Him which is understood to be man, such as, <q>But now you seek to kill Me, a man that has told you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which I have heard of the Father.</q>  And here, accordingly, he describes the element of weakness belonging to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, and that of readiness of spirit which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in His humanity: the element of weakness in the expression, <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me;</q> the readiness of the spirit in this, <q>Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.</q> And since it is proper to observe the order of our quotations, observe that, in the first place, there is mentioned only the single instance, as one would say, indicating the weakness of the flesh; and afterwards those other instances, greater in number, manifesting the willingness of the spirit. For the expression, <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me,</q> is only one: whereas more numerous are those others, viz., <q>Not as I will, but as You will;</q> and, <q>O My Father, if this cup cannot pass from Me except I drink it, Your will be done.</q> It is to be noted also, that the words are not, <q>let this cup depart from Me;</q> but that the whole expression is marked by a tone of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and reverence, <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me.</q> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, indeed, that there is another explanation of this passage to the following effect:&mdash; The Saviour, foreseeing the sufferings which the Jewish people and the city of Jerusalem were to undergo in requital of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had dared to perpetrate upon Him, from no other motive than that of the purest philanthropy towards them, and from a desire that they might escape the impending calamities, gave utterance to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me.</q> It is as if He had said, <q>Because of My drinking this cup of punishment, the whole nation will be forsaken by You, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, if it be possible, that this cup may pass from Me, in order that Your portion, which was guilty of such crimes against Me, may not be altogether deserted by You.</q> But if, as Celsus would allege, <q>nothing at that time was done to Jesus which was either painful or distressing,</q> how could men afterwards quote the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as enduring sufferings for the sake of religion, if He did <em>not</em> suffer what are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sufferings, but only had the <em>appearance</em> of so doing?</p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p>This Jew of Celsus still accuses the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> of having invented these statements, saying to them: <q>Even although guilty of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, you have not been able to give a colour of credibility to your inventions.</q> In answer to which we have to say, that there was an easy method of concealing these occurrences&mdash;that, viz., of not recording them at all. For if the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> had not contained the accounts of these things, who could have reproached us with Jesus having spoken such words during His stay upon the earth? Celsus, indeed, did not see that it was an inconsistency for the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> both to be deceived regarding Jesus, believing Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and to invent fictions about Him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> manifestly that these statements were false. Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, therefore, they were not guilty of inventing untruths, but such were their real impressions, and they recorded them <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>; or else they were guilty of falsifying the histories, and did not entertain these views, and were not deceived when they acknowledged Him to be God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

<p>After this he says, that certain of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, like <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who in a fit of <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> lay violent hands upon themselves, have corrupted the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> from its original integrity, to a threefold, and fourfold, and many-fold degree, and have remodelled it, so that they might be able to answer objections. Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of no others who have altered the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, save the followers of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and those of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, and, I think, also those of Lucian. But such an allegation is no charge against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> system, but against those who dared so to trifle with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. And as it is no ground of accusation against <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, that there exist Sophists, or <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, or Peripatetics, or any others, whoever they may be, who hold false opinions; so neither is it against genuine <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> that there are some who corrupt the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> histories, and who introduce <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> opposed to the meaning of the doctrine of Jesus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<p>And since this Jew of Celsus makes it a subject of reproach that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should make use of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who predicted the events of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> life, we have to say, in addition to what we have already advanced upon this head, that it became him to spare individuals, as he says, and to expound the prophecies themselves, and after admitting the probability of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> interpretation of them, to show how the use which they make of them may be overturned.  For in this way he would not appear hastily to assume so important a position on small grounds, and particularly when he asserts that the <q>prophecies agree with ten thousand other things more credibly than with Jesus.</q> And he ought to have carefully met this powerful argument of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, as being the strongest which they adduce, and to have demonstrated with regard to each particular <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, that it can apply to other events with greater probability than to Jesus. He did not, however, perceive that this was a plausible argument to be advanced against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> only by one who was an opponent of the prophetic writings; but Celsus has here put in the mouth of a Jew an objection which a Jew would not have made. For a Jew will not admit that the prophecies may be applied to countless other things with greater probability than to Jesus; but he will endeavour, after giving what appears to him the meaning of each, to oppose the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> interpretation, not indeed by any means adducing convincing reasons, but only attempting to do so.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>

<p>In the preceding pages we have already spoken of this point, viz., the prediction that there were to be two advents of Christ to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, so that it is not necessary for us to reply to the objection, supposed to be urged by a Jew, that <q>the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> declare the coming one to be a mighty potentate, Lord of all nations and armies.</q> But it is in the spirit of a Jew, I think, and in keeping with their bitter animosity, and baseless and even improbable <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against Jesus, that he adds: <q>Nor did the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> predict such a pestilence.</q>  For neither <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nor Celsus, nor any other, can bring any argument to prove that a pestilence converts men from the practice of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to a life which is according to nature, and distinguished by <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>

<p>This objection also is cast in our teeth by Celsus: <q>From such signs and misinterpretations, and from <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> so mean, no one could prove him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> Now it was his duty to enumerate the alleged misinterpretations, and to prove them to be such, and to show by reasoning the meanness of the evidence, in order that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, if any of his objections should seem to be plausible, might be able to answer and confute his arguments. What he said, however, regarding Jesus, did indeed come to pass, because He was a mighty potentate, although Celsus refuses to see that it so happened, notwithstanding that the clearest evidence proves it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of Jesus. <q>For as the sun,</q> he says, <q>which enlightens all other objects, first makes himself visible, so ought the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to have done.</q> We would say in reply, that so He did; for righteousness has arisen in His days, and there is abundance of peace, which took its commencement at His birth, God preparing the nations for His teaching, that they might be under one prince, the king of the Romans, and that it might not, owing to the want of union among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, caused by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of many kingdoms, be more difficult for the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to accomplish the task enjoined upon them by their Master, when He said, <q>Go and teach all nations.</q> Moreover it is certain that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born in the reign of Augustus, who, so to speak, fused together into one monarchy the many populations of the earth. Now the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of many kingdoms would have been a hindrance to the spread of the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> throughout the entire world; not only for the reasons mentioned, but also on account of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of men everywhere engaging in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and fighting on behalf of their native country, which was the case before the times of Augustus, and in periods still more remote, when necessity arose, as when the Peloponnesians and <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> warred against each other, and other nations in like manner. How, then, was it possible for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> doctrine of peace, which does not permit men to take vengeance even upon enemies, to prevail throughout the world, unless at the advent of Jesus  a milder spirit had been everywhere introduced into the conduct of things?</p>

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>

<p>He next charges the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with being <q>guilty of sophistical reasoning, in saying that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the <span class="greek"><a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a></span> Himself.</q> And he thinks that he strengthens the accusation, because <q>when we declare the <span class="greek"><a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a></span> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, we do not present to view a pure and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <span class="greek"><a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a></span>, but a most degraded man, who was punished by scourging and crucifixion.</q> Now, on this head we have briefly replied to the charges of Celsus in the preceding pages, where Christ was shown to be the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of all creation, who assumed a body and a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and that God gave commandment respecting the creation of such mighty things in the world, and they were created; and that He who received the command was God the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>. And seeing it is a Jew who makes these statements in the work of Celsus, it will not be out of place to quote the declaration, <q>He sent His word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destruction,</q> &mdash; a passage of which we spoke a little ago. Now, although I have conferred with many <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who professed to be learned men, I never heard any one expressing his approval of the statement that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as Celsus declares they do, in putting into the mouth of the Jew such a declaration as this: <q>If your <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, we also give our assent to the same.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>

<p>We have already shown that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> can be regarded neither as an arrogant man, nor a sorcerer; and therefore it is unnecessary to repeat our former arguments, lest, in replying to the tautologies of Celsus, we ourselves should be guilty of needless repetition. And now, in finding fault with our Lord's genealogy, there are certain points which occasion some difficulty even to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and which, owing to the discrepancy between the genealogies, are advanced by some as arguments against their correctness, but which Celsus has not even mentioned. For Celsus, who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a braggart, and who professes to be acquainted with all matters relating to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to raise doubts in a skilful manner against the credibility of Scripture. But he asserts that the <q>framers of the genealogies, from a feeling of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, made Jesus to be descended from the first man, and from the kings of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</q> And he thinks that he makes a notable charge when he adds, that <q>the carpenters wife could not have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the fact, had she been of such illustrious descent.</q> But what has this to do with the question? Granted that she was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of her descent, how does that affect the result? Suppose that she <em>were</em> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, how could her <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> prove that she was not descended from the first man, or could not derive her origin from the Jewish kings? Does Celsus <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the poor must always be descended from ancestors who are poor, or that kings are always born of kings? But it appears folly to waste time upon such an argument as this, seeing it is well known that, even in our own days, some who are poorer than Mary are descended from ancestors of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and distinction, and that rulers of nations and kings have sprung from <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of no <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33</h2>

<p><q>But,</q> continues Celsus, <q>what great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> did Jesus perform as being a God? Did he put his enemies to shame, or bring to a ridiculous conclusion what was designed against him?</q> Now to this question, although we are able to show the striking and miraculous character of the events which befell Him, yet from what other source can we furnish an answer than from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narratives, which state that <q>there was an earthquake, and that the rocks were split asunder, and the tombs opened, and the veil of the temple rent in two from top to bottom, and that darkness prevailed in the day-time, the sun failing to give light?</q>  But if Celsus <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> accounts when he thinks that he can find in them matter of charge against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them when they establish the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, our answer to him is: <q>Sir,  either disbelieve all the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narratives, and then no longer <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that you can found charges upon them; or, in yielding your belief to their statements, look in admiration on the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who became incarnate, and who desired to confer benefits upon the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. And this feature evinces the nobility of the work of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that, down to the present time, those whom God wills are healed by His name.  And with regard to the eclipse in the time of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a>, in whose reign Jesus appears to have been crucified, and the great earthquakes which then took place, Phlegon too, I think, has written in the thirteenth or fourteenth book of his Chronicles.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>

<p>This Jew of Celsus, ridiculing Jesus, as he imagines, is described as being acquainted with the Bacch&aelig; of Euripides, in which Dionysus says:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>The divinity himself will liberate me whenever I wish.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are not much acquainted with Greek literature; but suppose that there was a Jew so well versed in it (as to make such a quotation on his part appropriate), how (does it follow) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <em>could</em> not liberate Himself, because He did not do so? For let him <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> from our own Scriptures that Peter obtained his freedom after having been bound in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> having loosed his chains; and that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, having been bound in the stocks along with Silas in Philippi of Macedonia, was liberated by divine power, when the gates of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> were opened. But it is probable that Celsus treats these accounts with ridicule, or that he never read them; for he would probably say in reply, that there are certain sorcerers who are able by incantations to unloose chains and to open doors, so that he would liken the events related in our histories to the doings of sorcerers. <q>But,</q> he continues, <q>no calamity happened even to him who condemned him, as there did to Pentheus, viz., <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> or discerption.</q>  And yet he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was not so much <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> that condemned Him (who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that <q>for <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had delivered Him</q>), as the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation, which has been condemned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and rent in pieces, and dispersed over the whole earth, in a degree far beyond what happened to Pentheus. Moreover, why did he intentionally omit what is related of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> wife, who beheld a vision, and who was so moved by it as to send a message to her husband, saying: <q>Have nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> because of Him?</q>  And again, passing by in silence the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Celsus endeavours to cast reproach upon Him from the narratives in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, referring to those who mocked Jesus, and put on Him the purple robe, and the crown of thorns, and placed the reed in His hand. From what source now, Celsus, did you derive these statements, save from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narratives? And did you, accordingly, see that they were fit matters for reproach; while they who recorded them did not think that you, and such as you, would turn them into ridicule; but that others would receive from them an example how to despise those who ridiculed and mocked Him on account of His religion, who appropriately laid down His life for its sake? Admire rather their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that of the Being who bore these things voluntarily for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and who endured them with all constancy and long-suffering. For it is not recorded that He uttered any lamentation, or that after His condemnation He either did or uttered anything unbecoming.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35</h2>

<p>But in answer to this objection, <q>If not before, yet why now, at least, does he not give some manifestation of his divinity, and free himself from this reproach, and take vengeance upon those who insult both him and his Father?</q> We have to reply, that it would be the same thing as if we were to say to those among the Greeks who accept the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in portents, Why does God not punish those who insult the Divinity, and subvert the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>? For as the Greeks would answer such objections, so would we, in the same, or a more effective manner. There was not only a portent from heaven&mdash; the eclipse of the sun&mdash; but also the other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which show that the crucified One possessed something that was divine, and greater than was possessed by the majority of men.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36</h2>

<p>Celsus next says: <q>What is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the ichor in the body of the crucified Jesus? Is it 'such as flows in the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods?'</q>  He puts this question in a spirit of mockery; but we shall show from the serious narratives of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, although Celsus may not like it, that it was no mythic and Homeric ichor which flowed from the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, but that, after His death, <q>one of the soldiers with a spear pierced His side, and there came thereout blood and water. And he that saw it bare record, and his record is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he says the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  Now, in other dead bodies the blood congeals, and pure water does not flow forth; but the miraculous feature in the case of the dead body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was, that around the dead body blood and water flowed forth from the side. But if this Celsus, who, in order to find matter of accusation against Jesus and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, extracts from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> even passages which are incorrectly interpreted, but passes over in silence the evidences of the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, would listen to divine portents, let him read the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and see that even the centurion, and they who with him kept watch over Jesus, on seeing the earthquake, and the events that occurred, were greatly afraid, saying, <q>This man was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 37</h2>

<p>After this, he who extracts from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narrative those statements on which he thinks he can found an accusation, makes the vinegar and the gall a subject of reproach to Jesus, saying that <q>he rushed with open mouth  to drink of them, and could not endure his thirst as any ordinary man frequently endures it.</q> Now this matter admits of an explanation of a peculiar and figurative kind; but on the present occasion, the statement that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> predicted this very incident may be accepted as the more common answer to the objection. For in the <a href="../bible/psa068.htm">sixty-ninth Psalm</a> there is written, with reference to Christ: <q>And they gave me gall for my meat, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</q>  Now, let the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say who it is that the prophetic writing represents as uttering these words; and let them adduce from history one who received gall for his food, and to whom vinegar was given as drink. Would they venture to assert that the Christ whom they expect still to come might be placed in such circumstances? Then we would say, What prevents the prediction from having been already accomplished? For this very prediction was uttered many ages before, and is sufficient, along with the other prophetic utterances, to lead him who fairly examines the whole matter to the conclusion that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is He who was prophesied of as Christ, and as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38</h2>

<p>The few next remarks: <q>You, O sincere <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>,  find fault with us, because we do not recognise this individual as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor agree with you that he endured these (sufferings) for the benefit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, in order that we also might despise punishment.</q> Now, in answer to this, we say that we blame the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who have been brought up under the training of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> (which foretell the coming of Christ), because they neither refute the arguments which we lay before them to prove that He is the Messiah,  adducing such refutation as a defence of their unbelief; nor yet, while not offering any refutation, do they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him who was the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and who clearly manifested through His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, even after the period of His appearance in the flesh, that He underwent these things for the benefit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; having, as the object of His first advent, not to condemn men and their actions  before He had instructed them, and pointed out to them their duty,  nor to chastise the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and save the good, but to disseminate His doctrine in an extraordinary  manner, and with the evidence of divine power, among the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also have represented these things. And we blame them, moreover, because they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him who gave evidence of the power that was in Him, but asserted that He cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men through <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> the prince of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and we blame them because they <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> the philanthropic character of Him, who overlooked not only no city, but not even a single village in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, that He might everywhere announce the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, accusing Him of leading the wandering life of a vagabond, and passing an anxious <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in a disgraceful body. But there is no disgrace in enduring such labours for the benefit of all those who may be able to understand Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39</h2>

<p>And how can the following assertion of this Jew of Celsus appear anything else than a manifest <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, viz., that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <q>having gained over no one during his life, not even his own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, underwent these punishments and sufferings?</q> For from what other source sprang the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> which was aroused against Him by the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a>, and elders, and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, save from the fact that multitudes <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> and followed Him, and were led into the deserts not only by the persuasive  language of Him whose words were always appropriate to His hearers, but who also by His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> made an impression on those who were not moved to belief by His words? And is it not a manifest <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> to say that <q>he did not gain over even his own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</q> who exhibited, indeed, at that time some symptoms of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness arising from cowardly <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>&mdash; for they had not yet been disciplined to the exhibition of full <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>&mdash; but who by no means abandoned the judgments which they had formed regarding Him as the Christ? For Peter, after his denial, perceiving to what a depth of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> he had fallen, <q>went out and wept bitterly;</q> while the others, although stricken with dismay on account of what had happened to Jesus (for they still continued to admire Him), had, by His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> appearance,  their belief more firmly established than before that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40</h2>

<p>It is, moreover, in a very unphilosophical spirit that Celsus imagines our Lord's pre-eminence among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to consist, not in the preaching of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and in a pure morality, but in acting contrary to the character of that personality which He had taken upon Him, and in not dying, although He had assumed mortality; or, if dying, yet at least not such a death as might serve as a pattern to those who were to learn by that very act how to die for the sake of religion, and to comport themselves boldly through its help, before those who hold erroneous views on the subject of religion and irreligion, and who regard religious men as altogether irreligious, but <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> those to be most religious who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> regarding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who apply to everything rather than to God the ineradicable  idea of Him (which is implanted in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind), and especially when they eagerly rush to destroy those who have yielded themselves up with their whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (even unto death), to the clear evidence of one God who is over all things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 41</h2>

<p>In the person of the Jew, Celsus continues to find fault with Jesus, alleging that <q>he did not show himself to be pure from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> Let Celsus state from what <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></q> our Lord did not, show Himself to be pure. If he means that, He was not pure from what is properly termed <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> let him clearly prove the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> work in Him. But if he deems poverty and the cross to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and conspiracy on the part of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, then it is clear that he would say that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> had happened also to Socrates, who was unable to show himself pure from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. And how great also the other band of poor men is among the Greeks, who have given themselves to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> pursuits, and have voluntarily accepted a life of poverty, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to many among the Greeks from what is recorded of Democritus, who allowed his property to become pasture for sheep; and of Crates, who obtained his freedom by bestowing upon the Thebans the price received for the sale of his possessions. Nay, even Diogenes himself, from excessive poverty, came to live in a tub; and yet, in the opinion of no one possessed of moderate understanding, was Diogenes on that account considered to be in an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (sinful) condition.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42</h2>

<p>But further, since Celsus will have it that <q>Jesus was not irreproachable,</q> let him instance any one of those who adhere to His doctrine, who has recorded anything that could <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> furnish ground of reproach against Jesus; or if it be not from these that he derives his matter of accusation against Him, let him say from what quarter he has learned that which has induced him to say that He is not free from reproach. Jesus, however, performed all that He promised to do, and by which He conferred benefits upon his adherents. And we, continually seeing fulfilled all that was predicted by Him before it happened, viz., that this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of His should be preached throughout the whole world, and that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should go among all nations and announce His doctrine; and, moreover, that they should be brought before governors and kings on no other account than because of His teaching; we are lost in wonder at Him, and have our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him daily confirmed. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not by what greater or more convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> Celsus would have Him confirm His predictions; unless, indeed, as seems to be the case, not understanding that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> had become the man Jesus, he would have Him to be subject to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, nor to become an illustrious pattern to men of the manner in which they ought to bear the calamities of life, although these appear to Celsus to be most lamentable and disgraceful occurrences, seeing that he regards labour  to be the greatest of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and pleasure the perfect good&mdash;a view accepted by none of those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who admit the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and who allow that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and magnanimity are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Jesus, therefore, by His sufferings cast no discredit upon the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of which He was the object; but rather confirmed the same among those who would approve of manly <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and among those who were taught by Him that what was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and properly the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life was not here below, but was to be found in that which was called, according to His own words, the <q>coming world;</q> whereas in what is called the <q>present world</q> life is a calamity, or at least the first and greatest struggle of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 43</h2>

<p>Celsus next addresses to us the following remark: <q>You will not, I suppose, say of him, that, after failing to gain over those who were in this world, he went to Hades to gain over those who were there.</q> But whether he like it or not, we assert that not only while Jesus was in the body did He win over not a few <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> merely, but so great a number, that a conspiracy was formed against Him on account of the multitude of His followers; but also, that when He became a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, without the covering of the body, He dwelt among those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which were without bodily covering, converting such of them as were willing to Himself, or those whom He saw, for reasons <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Him alone, to be better adapted to such a course. </p>

<h2>Chapter 44</h2>

<p>Celsus in the next place says, with indescribable silliness: <q>If, after inventing defences which are absurd, and by which you were ridiculously deluded, you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that you really make a good defence, what prevents you from regarding those other individuals who have been condemned, and have died a miserable death, as greater and more divine messengers of heaven (than Jesus)?</q> Now, that manifestly and clearly there is no similarity between Jesus, who suffered what is described, and those who have died a wretched death on account of their sorcery, or whatever else be the charge against them, is patent to every one. For no one can point to any acts of a sorcerer which turned away <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from the practice of the many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which prevail among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and from the flood of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> (in the world).  But since this Jew of Celsus compares Him to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and says that <q>any similarly shameless fellow might be able to say regarding even a robber and murderer whom punishment had overtaken, that such an one was not a robber, but a god, because he predicted to his fellow <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> that he would suffer such punishment as he actually did suffer,</q> it might, in the first place, be answered, that it is not because He predicted that He would suffer such things that we entertain those opinions regarding Jesus which lead us to have confidence in Him, as one who has come down to us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, in the second place, we assert that this very comparison  has been somehow foretold in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>; since God was numbered with the transgressors by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, who desired rather a <q>murderer</q> (one who for sedition and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> had been cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>) to be released unto them, and Jesus to be crucified, and who crucified Him between two <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>. Jesus, indeed, is ever crucified with <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> among His genuine <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and witnesses to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and suffers the same condemnation which they do among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And we say, that if those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have any resemblance to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, who on account of their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards God suffer all kinds of injury and death, that they may keep it pure and unstained, according to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, then it is clear also that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the author of such teaching, is with good reason compared by Celsus to the captain of a band of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>. But neither was He who died for the common good of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, nor they who suffered because of their religion, and alone of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> because of what appeared to them the right way of honouring <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in accordance with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, nor was Jesus <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> without the charge of impiety being incurred by His persecutors.</p>

<p>But observe the superficial nature of his argument respecting the former <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, in which he says: <q>In the next place, those who were his associates while alive, and who listened to his voice, and enjoyed his instructions as their teacher, on seeing him subjected to punishment and death, neither died with him, nor for him, nor were even induced to regard punishment with contempt, but denied even that they were his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, whereas now you die along with him.</q> And here he believes the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which was committed by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> while they were yet beginners and imperfect, and which is recorded in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, to have been actually committed, in order that he may have matter of accusation against the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; but their upright conduct after their transgression, when they behaved with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> before the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and suffered countless cruelties at their hands, and at last suffered death for the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, he passes by in silence. For he would neither hear the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, when He predicted to Peter, <q>When you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands,</q>  etc., to which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> adds, <q>This spoke He, signifying by what death he should glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> nor how James the brother of John&mdash; an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, the brother of an apostle&mdash; was slain with the sword by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> for the doctrine of Christ; nor even the many instances of boldness displayed by Peter and the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> because of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and <q>how they went forth from the presence of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> after being scourged, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name,</q>  and so surpassing many of the instances related by the Greeks of the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. From the very beginning, then, this was inculcated as a precept of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> among His hearers, which taught men to despise the life which is eagerly sought after by the multitude, but to be earnest in living the life which resembles that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 46</h2>

<p>But how can this Jew of Celsus escape the charge of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, when he says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <q>when on earth, gained over to himself only ten sailors and tax-gatherers of the most worthless character, and not even the whole of these?</q> Now it is certain that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves would admit that He drew over not ten <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> merely, nor a hundred, nor a thousand, but on one occasion five thousand at once, and on another four thousand; and that He attracted them to such a degree that they followed Him even into the deserts, which alone could contain the assembled multitude of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in God through Jesus, and where He not only addressed to them discourses, but also manifested to them His works. And now, through his tautology, he compels us also to be tautological, since we are careful to guard against being supposed to pass over any of the charges advanced by him; and therefore, in reference to the matter before us following the order of his treatise as we have it, he says: <q>Is it not the height of absurdity to maintain, that if, while he himself was alive, he won over not a single person to his views, after his death any who wish are able to gain over such a multitude of individuals?</q> Whereas he ought to have said, in consistency with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that if, after His death, not simply those who will, but they who have the will and the power, can gain over so many proselytes, how much more consonant to reason is it, that while He was alive He should, through the greater power of His words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, have won over to Himself manifold greater numbers of adherents?</p>

<h2>Chapter 47</h2>

<p>He represents, moreover, a statement of his own as if it were an answer to one of his questions, in which he asks: <q>By what train of argument were you led to regard him as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</q> For he makes us answer that <q>we were won over to him, because  we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his punishment was undergone to bring about the destruction of the father of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> Now we were won over to His doctrine by innumerable other considerations, of which we have stated only the smallest part in the preceding pages; but, if God permit, we shall continue to enumerate them, not only while dealing with the so-called <em>True Discourse</em> of Celsus, but also on many other occasions. And, as if we said that we consider Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> because He suffered punishment, he asks: <q>What then? Have not many others, too, been punished, and that not less disgracefully?</q> And here Celsus acts like the most contemptible enemies of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and like those who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that it follows as a consequence from our history of the crucified Jesus, that we should worship those who have undergone crucifixion!</p>

<h2>Chapter 48</h2>

<p>Celsus, moreover, unable to resist the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which Jesus is recorded to have performed, has already on several occasions spoken of them slanderously as works of sorcery; and we also on several occasions have, to the best of our ability, replied to his statements. And now he represents us as saying that <q>we deemed Jesus to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, because he healed the lame and the blind.</q> And he adds: <q>Moreover, as you assert, he raised the dead.</q> That He healed the lame and the blind, and that therefore we hold Him to be the Christ and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, is manifest to us from what is contained in the prophecies: <q>Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear; then shall the lame man leap as an hart.</q>  And that He also raised the dead, and that it is no fiction of those who composed the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, is shown by this, that if it had been a fiction, <em>many</em> individuals would have been represented as having risen from the dead, and these, too, such as had been many years in their graves. But as it is no fiction, they are very easily counted of whom this is related to have happened; viz., the daughter of the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> (of whom I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not why He said, <q>She is not dead, but sleeps,</q> stating regarding her something which does not apply to all who die); and the only son of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, on whom He took compassion and raised him up, making the bearers of the corpse to stand still; and the third instance, that of Lazarus, who had been four days in the grave. Now, regarding these cases we would say to all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of candid <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and especially to the Jew, that as there were many <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> in the days of Elisha the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and none of them was healed save Naaman the Syrian, and many <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> in the days of Elijah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, to none of whom was Elijah sent save to Sarepta in Sidonia (for the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> there had been deemed worthy by a divine decree of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> which was wrought by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the matter of the bread); so also there were many dead in the days of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, but those only rose from the grave whom the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be fitted for a resurrection, in order that the works done by the Lord might not be merely <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of certain things, but that by the very acts themselves He might gain over many to the marvellous doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. I would say, moreover, that, agreeably to the promise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> performed even greater works than these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, which were perceptible only to the senses.  For the eyes of those who are blind in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are ever opened; and the ears of those who were deaf to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> words, listen readily to the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of the blessed life with Him; and many, too, who were lame in the feet of the <q>inner man,</q> as Scripture calls it, having now been healed by the word, do not simply leap, but leap as the hart, which is an animal hostile to serpents, and stronger than all the poison of vipers. And these lame who have been healed, receive from Jesus power to trample, with those feet in which they were formerly lame, upon the serpents and scorpions of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and generally upon all the power of the enemy; and though they tread upon it, they sustain no injury, for they also have become stronger than the poison of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 49</h2>

<p>Jesus, accordingly, in turning away the minds of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, not merely from giving heed to sorcerers in general, and those who profess in any other manner to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>&mdash; for His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> did not need to be so warned&mdash; but from such as gave themselves out as the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who tried by certain apparent  <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> to gain over to them the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, said in a certain passage: <q>Then, if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore, if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, go not forth; behold, he is in the secret chambers, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it not. For as the lightning comes out of the east, and shines even to the west, so also shall the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be.</q>  And in another passage: <q>Many will say unto Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten and drunk in Your name, and by Your name have cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and done many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>? And then will I say unto them, Depart from Me, because you are workers of iniquity.</q>  But Celsus, wishing to assimilate the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to the works of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sorcery, says in express terms as follows: <q>O light and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>! He distinctly declares, with his own voice, as you yourselves have recorded, that there will come to you even others, employing <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of a similar kind, who are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, and sorcerers; and he calls him who makes use of such devices, one <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. So that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> himself does not deny that these works at least are not at all divine, but are the acts of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men; and being compelled by the force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he at the same time not only laid open the doings of others, but convicted himself of the same acts. Is it not, then, a miserable inference, to conclude from the same works that the one is God and the other sorcerers? Why ought the others, because of these acts, to be accounted <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> rather than this man, seeing they have him as their <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against himself? For he has himself acknowledged that these are not the works of a divine nature, but the inventions of certain deceivers, and of thoroughly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men.</q> Observe, now, whether Celsus is not clearly convicted of <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandering</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> by such statements, since what Jesus says regarding those who are to work signs and wonders is different from what this Jew of Celsus alleges it to be. For if Jesus had simply told His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to be on their guard against those who professed to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, without declaring what they would give themselves out to be, then perhaps there would have been some ground for his suspicion. But since those against whom Jesus would have us to be on our guard give themselves out as the Christ&mdash; which is not a claim put forth by sorcerers&mdash; and since He says that even some who lead <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> lives will perform <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and expel <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> out of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, sorcery in the case of these individuals, or any suspicion of such, is rather, if we may so speak, altogether banished, and the divinity of Christ established, as well as the divine mission  of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; seeing that it is possible that one who makes use of His name, and who is wrought upon by some power, in some way unknown, to make the pretence that he is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, should seem to perform <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> like those of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, while others through His name should do works resembling those of His genuine <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, moreover, in the second Epistle to the Thessalonians, shows in what manner there will one day be revealed <q>the man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that is worshipped; so that he sits in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, showing himself that he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And again he says to the Thessalonians: <q>And now you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what withholds that he might be revealed in his time. For the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way: and then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: even him, whose cunning is after the working of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.</q>  And in assigning the reason why the man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is permitted to continue in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, he says: <q>Because they received not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that they might be saved. And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> God shall send them strong delusion, that they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>; that they all might be damned who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</q>  Let any one now say whether any of the statements in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, or in the writings of the apostle, could give occasion for the suspicion that there is therein contained any prediction of sorcery. Any one, moreover, who likes may find the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in Daniel respecting antichrist.  But Celsus falsities the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, since He did not say that others would come working similar <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> to Himself, but who are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men and sorcerers, although Celsus asserts that He uttered such words. For as the power of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> magicians was not similar to the divinely-bestowed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but the issue clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the acts of the former were the effect of magic, while those of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> were wrought by divine power; so the proceedings of the antichrists, and of those who feign that they can work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> as being the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are said to be lying signs and wonders, prevailing with all deceivableness of unrighteousness among them that perish; whereas the works of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had for their fruit, not deceit, but the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. And who would rationally maintain that an improved moral life, which daily lessened the number of a man's offenses, could proceed from a system of deceit?</p>

<h2>Chapter 51</h2>

<p>Celsus, indeed, evinced a slight <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Scripture when he made Jesus say, that it is <q>a certain <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> who contrives such devices;</q> although he begs the question  when he asserts that <q>Jesus did not deny that these works have in them nothing of divinity, but proceed from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men,</q> for he makes things which differ in kind to be the same. Now, as a wolf is not of the same species as a dog, although it may appear to have some resemblance in the figure of its body and in its voice, nor a common wood-pigeon  the same as a dove,  so there is no resemblance between what is done by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and what is the effect of sorcery. And we might further say, in answer to the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of Celsus, Are those to be regarded as <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which are wrought through sorcery by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but those not which are performed by a nature that is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and divine? And does <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life endure the worse, but never receive the better? Now it appears to me that we must lay it down as a general principle, that as, wherever anything that is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> would make itself to be of the same nature with the good, there must by all means be something that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; so also, in opposition to those things which are brought about by sorcery, there must also of necessity be some things in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life which are the result of divine power. And it follows from the same, that we must either annihilate both, and assert that neither exists, or, assuming the one, and particularly the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, admit also the reality of the good. Now, if one were to lay it down that works are wrought by means of sorcery, but would not grant that there are also works which are the product of divine power, he would seem to me to resemble him who should admit the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of sophisms and plausible arguments, which have the appearance of establishing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, although really undermining it, while denying that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> had anywhere a home among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or a dialectic which differed from sophistry. But if we once admit that it is consistent with the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of magic and sorcery (which derive their power from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who are spell-bound by elaborate incantations, and become subject to sorcerers) that some works must be found among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> which proceed from a power that is divine, why shall we not test those who profess to perform them by their lives and morals, and the consequences of their <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, viz., whether they tend to the injury of men or to the reformation of conduct? What minister of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, e.g., can do such things? And by means of what incantations and magic arts? And who, on the other hand, is it that, having his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and his spirit, and I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> also his body, in a pure and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> state, receives a divine spirit, and performs such works in order to benefit men, and to lead them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? But if we must once investigate (without being carried away by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> themselves) who it is that performs them by help of a good, and who by help of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> power, so that we may neither <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> all without discrimination, nor yet admire and accept all as divine, will it not be manifest, from what occurred in the times of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Jesus, when entire nations were established in consequence of their <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, that these men wrought by means of divine power what they are recorded to have performed? For <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and sorcery would not have led a whole nation to rise not only above <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and images erected by men, but also above all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, and to ascend to the uncreated origin of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 52</h2>

<p>But since it is a Jew who makes these assertions in the treatise of Celsus, we would say to him: Pray, friend, why do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works which are recorded in your writings as having been performed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the instrumentality of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to be really divine, and endeavour to refute those who slanderously assert that they were wrought by sorcery, like those of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> magicians; while, in imitation of your <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> opponents, you charge those which were done by Jesus, and which, you admit, were actually performed, with not being divine? For if the final result, and the founding of an entire nation by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, manifestly demonstrate that it was God who brought these things to pass in the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the Hebrew lawgiver, why should not such rather be shown to be the case with Jesus, who accomplished far greater works than those of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? For the former took those of his own nation, the descendants of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who had observed the rite of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> transmitted by tradition, and who were careful observers of the Abrahamic usages, and led them out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, enacting for them those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be divine; whereas the latter ventured upon a greater undertaking, and superinduced upon the pre-existing constitution, and upon ancestral customs and modes of life agreeable to the existing <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, a constitution in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. And as it was necessary, in order that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> should find credit not only among the elders, but the common people, that there should be performed those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which he is recorded to have performed, why should not Jesus also, in order that He may be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on by those of the people who had learned to ask for signs and wonders, need  to work such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> as, on account of their greater grandeur and divinity (in comparison with those of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>), were able to convert men from Jewish fables, and from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> traditions which prevailed among them, and make them admit that He who taught and did such things was greater than the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? For how was not He greater than the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who was proclaimed by them to be the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and the Saviour of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 53</h2>

<p>All the arguments, indeed, which this Jew of Celsus advances against those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Jesus, may, by parity of reasoning, be urged as ground of accusation against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: so that there is no difference in asserting that the sorcery practised by Jesus and that by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> were similar to each other, &mdash; both of them, so far as the language of this Jew of Celsus is concerned, being liable to the same charge; as, e.g., when this Jew says of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>But, O light and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>! Jesus with his own voice expressly declares, as you yourselves have recorded, that there will appear among you others also, who will perform <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> like mine, but who are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men and sorcerers,</q> some one, either Greek or <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, or any other party who disbelieved the Jew, might say respecting <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>But, O light and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>! <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> with his own voice expressly declares, as you also have recorded, that there will appear among you others also, who will perform <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> like mine, but who are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men and sorcerers. For it is written in your law, 'If there arise among you a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder, and the sign or wonder come to pass whereof he spoke unto you, saying, Let us go after other gods which you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and let us serve them; you shall not hearken to the words of that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, or dreamer of dreams,'</q>  etc. Again, perverting the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, he says, <q>And he terms him who devises such things, one <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>;</q> while one, applying this to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, might say, <q>And he terms him who devises such things, a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who dreams.</q> And as this Jew asserts regarding Jesus, that <q>even he himself does not deny that these works have in them nothing of divinity, but are the acts of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men;</q> so any one who disbelieves the writings of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> might say, quoting what has been already said, the same thing, viz., that, <q>even <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> does not deny that these works have in them nothing of divinity, but are the acts of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men.</q> And he will do the same thing also with respect to this: <q>Being compelled by the force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> at the same time both exposed the doings of others, and convicted himself of the same.</q> And when the Jew says, <q>Is it not a wretched inference from the same acts, to conclude  that the one is a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the others sorcerers?</q> one might object to him, on the ground of those words of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> already quoted, <q>Is it not then a wretched inference from the same acts, to conclude that the one is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the others sorcerers?</q> But when, in addition to those comparisons which I have already mentioned, Celsus, dwelling upon the subject, adduces this also: <q>Why from these works should the others be accounted <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, rather than this man, seeing they have him as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against himself?</q>&mdash; we, too, shall adduce the following, in addition to what has been already said: <q>Why, from those passages in which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> forbids us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those who exhibit signs and wonders, ought we to consider such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, rather than <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, because he <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniates</a> some of them in respect of their signs and wonders?</q> And urging more to the same effect, that he may appear to strengthen his attempt, he says: <q>He himself acknowledged that these were not the works of a divine nature, but were the inventions of certain deceivers, and of very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men.</q> Who, then, is <q>himself?</q> You O Jew, say that it is Jesus; but he who accuses you as liable to the same charges, will transfer this <q>himself</q> to the person of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 54</h2>

<p>After this, forsooth, the Jew of Celsus, to keep up the character assigned to the Jew from the beginning, in his address to those of his countrymen who had become <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, says: <q>By what, then, were you induced (to become his followers)? Was it because he foretold that after his death he would rise again?</q> Now this question, like the others, can be retorted upon <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. For we might say to the Jew: <q>By what, then, were <em>you</em> induced (to become the follower of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>)? Was it because he put on record the following statement about his own death: 'And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the servant of the Lord died there, in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord; and they buried him in Moab, near the house of Phogor: and no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his sepulchre until this day?'</q>  For as the Jew casts discredit upon the statement, that <q>Jesus foretold that after His death He would rise again,</q> another person might make a similar assertion about <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and would say in reply, that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also put on record (for the book of Deuteronomy is his composition) the statement, that <q>no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his sepulchre until this day,</q> in order to magnify and enhance the importance of his place of burial, as being unknown to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 55</h2>

<p>The Jew continues his address to those of his countrymen who are converts, as follows: <q>Come now, let us grant to you that the prediction was actually uttered. Yet how many others are there who practise such juggling tricks, in order to deceive their simple hearers, and who make gain by their deception?&mdash; as was the case, they say, with Zamolxis  in Scythia, the slave of Pythagoras; and with Pythagoras himself in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; and with Rhampsinitus  in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (the latter of whom, they say, played at dice with Demeter in Hades, and returned to the upper world with a golden napkin which he had received from her as a gift); and also with Orpheus  among the Odrysians, and Protesilaus in Thessaly, and Hercules  at Cape T&aelig;narus, and Theseus. But the question is, whether any one who was really dead ever rose with a veritable body.  Or do you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> the statements of others not only to be myths, but to have the appearance of such, while you have discovered a becoming and credible termination to your drama in the voice from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, when he breathed his last, and in the earthquake and the darkness? That while alive he was of no assistance to himself, but that when dead he rose again, and showed the marks of his punishment, and how his hands were pierced with nails: who beheld this? A half-frantic  <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, as you state, and some other one, perhaps, of those who were engaged in the same system of delusion, who had either dreamed so, owing to a peculiar state of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,  or under the influence of a wandering imagination had formed to himself an appearance according to his own wishes,  which has been the case with numberless individuals; or, which is most probable, one who desired to impress others with this portent, and by such a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> to furnish an occasion to <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a> like himself.</q></p>

<p>Now, since it is a Jew who makes these statements, we shall conduct the defence of our Jesus as if we were replying to a Jew, still continuing the comparison derived from the accounts regarding <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and saying to him: <q>How many others are there who practise similar juggling tricks to those of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, in order to deceive their silly hearers, and who make gain by their deception?</q> Now this objection would be more appropriate in the mouth of one who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (as we might quote the instances of Zamolxis and Pythagoras, who were engaged in such juggling tricks) than in that of a Jew, who is not very learned in the histories of the Greeks. An <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, moreover, who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, might credibly adduce the instance of Rhampsinitus, saying that it was far more credible that he had descended to Hades, and had played at dice with Demeter, and that after stealing from her a golden napkin he exhibited it as a sign of his having been in Hades, and of his having returned thence, than that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> should have recorded that he entered into the darkness, where God was, and that he alone, above all others, drew near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the following is his statement: <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> alone shall come near the Lord; but the rest shall not come near.</q>  We, then, who are the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, say to the Jew who urges these objections: <q>While assailing our belief in Jesus, defend yourself, and answer the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> and the Greek objectors: what will you say to those charges which you brought against our Jesus, but which also might be brought against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> first? And if you should make a vigorous effort to defend <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as indeed his history does admit of a clear and powerful defence, you will unconsciously, in your support of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, be an unwilling assistant in establishing the greater divinity of Jesus.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 56</h2>

<p>But since the Jew says that these histories of the alleged descent of heroes to Hades, and of their return thence, are juggling impositions,  maintaining that these heroes disappeared for a certain time, and secretly withdrew themselves from the sight of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and gave themselves out afterwards as having returned from Hades,&mdash; for such is the meaning which his words seem to convey respecting the Odrysian Orpheus, and the Thessalian Protesilaus, and the T&aelig;narian Hercules, and Theseus also&mdash;let us endeavour to show that the account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being raised from the dead cannot possibly be compared to these. For each one of the heroes respectively mentioned might, had he wished, have secretly withdrawn himself from the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and returned again, if so determined, to those whom he had left; but seeing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was crucified before all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and His body slain in the presence of His nation, how can they bring themselves to say that He practised a similar deception  with those heroes who are related to have gone down to Hades, and to have returned thence? But we say that the following consideration might be adduced, perhaps, as a defence of the public crucifixion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, especially in connection with the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of those stories of heroes who are supposed to have been compelled  to descend to Hades: that if we were to suppose Jesus to have died an obscure death, so that the fact of His decease was not patent to the whole nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and afterwards to have actually risen from the dead, there would, in such a case, have been ground for the same suspicion entertained regarding the heroes being also entertained regarding Himself. Probably, then, in addition to other causes for the crucifixion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, this also may have contributed to His dying a conspicuous death upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, that no one might have it in his power to say that He voluntarily withdrew from the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and seemed only to die, without really doing so; but, appearing again, made a juggler's trick  of the resurrection from the dead. But a clear and unmistakeable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the fact I hold to be the undertaking of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who devoted themselves to the teaching of a doctrine which was attended with danger to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life&mdash;a doctrine which they would not have taught with such <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> had they invented the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from the dead; and who also, at the same time, not only prepared others to despise death, but were themselves the first to manifest their disregard for its terrors.</p>

<h2>Chapter 57</h2>

<p>But observe whether this Jew of Celsus does not talk very blindly, in saying that it is impossible for any one to rise from the dead with a veritable body, his language being: <q>But this is the question, whether any one who was really dead ever rose again with a veritable body?</q> Now a Jew would not have uttered these words, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> what is recorded in the third and fourth books of Kings regarding little children, of whom the one was raised up by Elijah,  and the other by Elisha.  And on this account, too, I think it was that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> appeared to no other nation than the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who had become accustomed to miraculous occurrences; so that, by comparing what they themselves <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> with the works which were done by Him, and with what was related of Him, they might confess that He, in regard to whom greater things were done, and by whom mightier marvels were performed, was greater than all those who preceded Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 58</h2>

<p>Further, after these Greek stories which the Jew adduced respecting those who were guilty of juggling practices,  and who pretended to have risen from the dead, he says to those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who are converts to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>: <q>Do you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> the statements of others not only to be myths, but to have the appearance of such, while you have discovered a becoming and credible termination to your drama in the voice from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, when he breathed his last?</q> We reply to the Jew: <q>What you adduce as myths, we regard also as such; but the statements of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which are common to us both, in which not you only, but we also, take <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, we do not at all regard as myths. And therefore we accord our belief to those who have therein related that some rose from the dead, as not being guilty of imposition; and to Him especially there mentioned as having risen, who both predicted the event Himself, and was the subject of prediction by others. And His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> is more miraculous than that of the others in this respect, that they were raised by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> Elijah and Elisha, while He was raised by none of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but by His Father in heaven. And therefore His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> also produced greater results than theirs. For what great good has accrued to the world from the resurrection of the children through the instrumentality of Elijah and Elisha, such as has resulted from the preaching of the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, accepted as an article of belief, and as effected through the agency of divine power?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 59</h2>

<p>He imagines also that both the earthquake and the darkness were an invention;  but regarding these, we have in the preceding pages, made our defence, according to our ability, adducing the testimony of Phlegon, who relates that these events took place at the time when our Saviour suffered.  And he goes on to say, that <q>Jesus, while alive, was of no assistance to himself, but that he arose after death, and exhibited the marks of his punishment, and showed how his hands had been pierced by nails.</q> We ask him what he means by the expression, <q>was of no assistance to himself?</q> For if he means it to refer to want of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, we reply that He <em>was</em> of very great assistance. For He neither uttered nor committed anything that was improper, but was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <q>led as a sheep to the slaughter, and was dumb as a lamb before the shearer;</q>  and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> testifies that He opened not His mouth. But if Celsus applies the expression to things indifferent and corporeal,  (meaning that in such Jesus could render no help to Himself,) we say that we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> that He went voluntarily to encounter His sufferings. Speaking next of the statements in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, that after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> He showed the marks of His punishment, and how His hands had been pierced, he asks, <q>Who beheld this?</q> And discrediting the narrative of Mary Magdalene, who is related to have seen Him, he replies, <q>A half-frantic <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, as you state.</q> And because she is not the only one who is recorded to have seen the Saviour after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, but others also are mentioned, this Jew of Celsus <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniates</a> these statements also in adding, <q>And some one else of those engaged in the same system of deception!</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 60</h2>

<p>In the next place, as if this were possible, viz., that the image of a man who was dead could appear to another as if he were still living, he adopts this opinion as an Epicurean, and says, <q>That some one having so dreamed owing to a peculiar state of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or having, under the influence of a perverted imagination, formed such an appearance as he himself desired, reported that such had been seen; and this,</q> he continues, <q>has been the case with numberless individuals.</q> But even if this statement of his seems to have a considerable degree of force, it is nevertheless only fitted to confirm a necessary doctrine, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the dead exists in a separate state (from the body); and he who adopts such an opinion does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> without good reason in the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, or at least continued <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as even <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says in his treatise on the Soul that shadowy phantoms of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> already dead have appeared to some around their sepulchres. Now the phantoms which exist about the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the dead are produced by some substance, and this substance is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which exists apart in a body said to be of splendid appearance.  But Celsus, unwilling to admit any such view, will have it that some dreamed a waking dream,  and, under the influence of a perverted imagination, formed to themselves such an image as they desired. Now it is not irrational to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that a dream may take place while one is asleep; but to suppose a waking vision in the case of those who are not altogether out of their senses, and under the influence of delirium or hypochondria, is incredible. And Celsus, seeing this, called the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <q>half-mad,</q>&mdash; a statement which is not made by the history recording the fact, but from which he took occasion to charge the occurrences with being untrue.</p>

<h2>Chapter 61</h2>

<p>Jesus accordingly, as Celsus imagines, exhibited after His death only the appearance of wounds received on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and was not in reality so wounded as He is described to have been; whereas, according to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>&mdash; some portions of which Celsus arbitrarily accepts, in order to find ground of accusation, and other parts of which he rejects&mdash; Jesus called to Him one of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who was sceptical, and who deemed the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> an impossibility. That individual had, indeed, expressed his belief in the statement of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who said that she had seen Him, because he did not think it impossible that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a dead man could be seen; but he did not yet consider the report to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that He had been raised in a body, which was the antitype of the former.  And therefore he did not merely say, <q>Unless I see, I will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>;</q> but he added, <q>Unless I put my hand into the print of the nails, and lay my hands upon His side, I will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> These words were spoken by <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a>, who deemed it possible that the body of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>  might be seen by the eye of sense, resembling in all respects its former appearance,</p>

<blockquote><p>Both in size, and in beauty of eyes,
<br>And in voice;
</p></blockquote>

<p>and frequently, too,</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Having, also, such garments around the person  (as when alive).</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Jesus accordingly, having called <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a>, said, <q>Reach hither your finger, and behold My hands; and reach hither your hand, and thrust it into My side: and be not faithless, but believing.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 62</h2>

<p>Now it followed from all the predictions which were uttered regarding Him&mdash; among which was this prediction of the resurrection&mdash; and, from all that was done by Him, and from all the events which befell Him, that this event should be marvellous above all others. For it had been said beforehand by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the person of Jesus: <q>My flesh shall rest in hope, and You will not leave my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in Hades, and will not suffer Your Holy One to see corruption.</q>  And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in a body intermediate, as it were, between the grossness of that which He had before His sufferings, and the appearance of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> uncovered by such a body. And hence it was, that when His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were together, and <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a> with them, there <q>came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then says He to <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a>, Reach hither your finger,</q>  etc. And in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Luke also, while Simon and Cleopas were conversing with each other respecting all that had happened to them, Jesus <q>drew near, and went with them. And their eyes were holden, that they should not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. And He said unto them, What manner of communications are these that you have one to another, as you walk?</q> And when their eyes were opened, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him, then the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, in express words, <q>And He vanished out of their sight.</q>  And although Celsus may wish to place what is told of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and of those who saw Him after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, on the same level with imaginary appearances of a different kind, and those who have invented such, yet to those who institute a candid and intelligent examination, the events will appear only the more miraculous.</p>

<h2>Chapter 63</h2>

<p>After these points, Celsus proceeds to bring against the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narrative a charge which is not to be lightly passed over, saying that <q>if Jesus desired to show that his power was really divine, he ought to have appeared to those who had ill-treated him, and to him who had condemned him, and to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> universally.</q> For it appears to us also to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> account, that He was not seen after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> in the same manner as He used formerly to show Himself&mdash; publicly, and to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But it is recorded in the Acts, that <q>being seen during forty days,</q> He expounded to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <q>the things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q>  And in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>  it is not stated that He was always with them; but that on one occasion He appeared in their midst, after eight days, when the doors were shut, and on another in some similar fashion. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also, in the concluding portions of the first Epistle to the Corinthians, in reference to His not having publicly appeared as He did in the period before He suffered, writes as follows: <q>For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; and that He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain unto the present time, but some are fallen asleep. After that He was seen of James, then of all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. And last of all He was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.</q>  I am of opinion now that the statements in this passage contain some great and wonderful <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, which are beyond the grasp not merely of the great multitude of ordinary <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, but even of those who are far advanced (in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>), and that in them the reason would be explained why He did not show Himself, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the dead, in the same manner as before that event. And in a treatise of this nature, composed in answer to a work directed against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, observe whether we are able to adduce a few rational arguments out of a greater number, and thus make an impression upon the hearers of this apology.</p>

<h2>Chapter 64</h2>

<p>Although Jesus was only a single individual, He was nevertheless more things than one, according to the different standpoint from which He might be regarded;  nor was He seen in the same way by all who beheld Him. Now, that He was more things than one, according to the varying point of view, is clear from this statement, <q>I am the way, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life;</q> and from this, <q>I am the bread;</q> and this, <q>I am the door,</q> and innumerable others. And that when seen He did not appear in like fashion to all those who saw Him, but according to their several ability to receive Him, will be clear to those who notice why, at the time when He was about to be transfigured on the high mountain, He did not admit all His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> (to this sight), but only Peter, and James, and John, because they alone were capable of beholding His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on that occasion, and of observing the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> appearance of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah, and of listening to their conversation, and to the voice from the heavenly cloud. I am of opinion, too, that before He ascended the mountain where His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came to Him alone, and where He taught them the beatitudes, when He was somewhere in the lower part of the mountain, and when, as it became late, He healed those who were brought to Him, freeing them from all sickness and disease, He did not appear the same person to the sick, and to those who needed His healing aid, as to those who were able by reason of their strength to go up the mountain along with Him. Nay, even when He interpreted privately to His own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> which were delivered to the multitudes without, from whom the explanation was withheld, as they who heard them explained were endowed with higher organs of hearing than they who heard them without explanation, so was it altogether the same with the eyes of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and, I think, also with those of their body.  And the following statement shows that He had not always the same appearance, viz., that Judas, when about to betray Him, said to the multitudes who were setting out with him, as not being acquainted with Him, <q>Whomsoever I shall <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, the same is He.</q>  And I think that the Saviour Himself indicates the same thing by the words: <q>I was daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you laid no hold on Me.</q>  Entertaining, then, such exalted views regarding Jesus, not only with respect to the Deity within, and which was hidden from the view of the multitude, but with respect to the transfiguration of His body, which took place when and to whom He would, we say, that before Jesus had <q>put off the governments and powers,</q>  and while as yet He was not dead unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were capable of seeing Him; but that, when He had <q>put off the governments and powers,</q> and had no longer anything which was capable of being seen by the multitude, all who had formerly seen Him were not now able to behold Him. And therefore, sparing them, He did not show Himself to all after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the dead.</p>

<h2>Chapter 65</h2>

<p>And why do I say <q>to all?</q> For even with His own <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> He was not perpetually present, nor did He constantly show Himself to them, because they were not able without intermission  to receive His divinity. For His deity was more resplendent after He had finished the economy  (of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>): and this Peter, surnamed Cephas, the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> as it were of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, was enabled to behold, and along with him the twelve (Matthias having been substituted in room of Judas); and after them He appeared to the five hundred brethren at once, and then to James, and subsequently to all the others besides the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, perhaps to the seventy also, and lastly to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, as to one born out of due time, and who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> well how to say, <q>Unto me, who am less than the least of all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, is this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given;</q> and probably the expression <q>least of all</q> has the same meaning with <q>one born out of due time.</q> For as no one could reasonably blame Jesus for not having admitted all His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to the high mountain, but only the three already mentioned, on the occasion of His transfiguration, when He was about to manifest the splendour which appeared in His garments, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias talking with Him, so none could reasonably object to the statements of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who introduce the appearance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> as having been made not to all, but to those only whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to have received eyes capable of seeing His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. I think, moreover, that the following statement regarding Him has an apologetic value  in reference to our subject, viz.: <q>For to this end Christ died, and rose again, that He might be Lord both of the 'dead and living.'</q>  For observe, it is conveyed in these words, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died that He might be Lord of the dead; and that He rose again to be Lord not only of the dead, but also of the living. And the apostle understands, undoubtedly, by the dead over whom Christ is to be Lord, those who are so called in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, <q>For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible;</q>  and by the living, those who are to be changed, and who are different from the dead who are to be raised. And respecting the living the words are these, <q>And we shall be changed;</q> an expression which follows immediately after the statement, <q>The dead shall be raised first.</q>  Moreover, in the first Epistle to the Thessalonians, describing the same change in different words, he says, that they who sleep are not the same as those who are alive; his language being, <q>I would not have you to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, brethren, concerning them who are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died, and rose again, even so them also that sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them that are asleep.</q>  The explanation which appeared to us to be appropriate to this passage, we gave in the exegetical remarks which we have made on the first Epistle to the Thessalonians.</p>

<h2>Chapter 66</h2>

<p>And be not surprised if all the multitudes who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Jesus do not behold His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, writing to the Corinthians, can say to them, as being incapable of receiving greater matters, <q>For I determined not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything among you, save <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and Him crucified;</q>  which is the same as saying, <q>Hitherto you were not able, neither yet now are you able, for you are still carnal.</q>  The Scripture, therefore, doing everything by appointment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has recorded of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that before His sufferings He appeared to all indifferently, but not always; while after His sufferings He no longer appeared to all in the same way, but with a certain discrimination which measured out to each his due. And as it is related that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,</q> or to one of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and this <q>appearance</q> was not a thing of constant occurrence, but took place at intervals, and not to all, so understand that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> appeared in the one case on the same principle that God appeared to the latter. </p>

<h2>Chapter 67</h2>

<p>To the best of our ability, therefore, as in a treatise of this nature, we have answered the objection, that <q>if Jesus had really wished to manifest his divine power, he ought to have shown himself to those who ill-treated him, and to the judge who condemned him, and to all without reservation.</q> There was, however, no obligation on Him to appear either to the judge who condemned Him, or to those who ill-treated Him. For Jesus spared both the one and the other, that they might not be smitten with blindness, as the men of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> were when they conspired against the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> entertained by <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>. And here is the account of the matter: <q>But the men put forth their hand, and pulled <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> into the house to them, and shut to the door. And they smote the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great; so that they wearied themselves to find the door.</q>  Jesus, accordingly, wished to show that His power was divine to each one who was capable of seeing it, and according to the measure of His capability. And I do not suppose that He guarded against being seen on any other ground than from a regard to the fitness of those who were incapable of seeing Him. And it is in vain for Celsus to add, <q>For he had no longer occasion to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> any man after his death, being, as you say, a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor was he sent into the world at all for the purpose of being hid.</q> Yet He was sent into the world not only to become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but also to be hid. For all that He was, was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> even to those to whom He was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but a certain part of Him remained concealed even from them; and to some He was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at all. And He opened the gates of light to those who were the sons of darkness and of night, and had devoted themselves to becoming the sons of light and of the day. For our Saviour Lord, like a good physician, came rather to us who were full of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, than to those who were righteous.</p>

<h2>Chapter 68</h2>

<p>But let us observe how this Jew of Celsus asserts that, <q>if this at least would have helped to manifest his divinity, he ought accordingly to have at once disappeared from the cross.</q> Now this seems to me to be like the argument of those who oppose the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and who arrange things differently from what they are, and allege that the world would be better if it were as they arrange it. Now, in those instances in which their arrangement is a possible one, they are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to make the world, so far as depends upon them, worse by their arrangement than it actually is; while in those cases in which they do not portray things worse than they really are, they are shown to desire impossibilities; so that in either case they are deserving of ridicule. And here, accordingly, that there was no impossibility in His coming, as a being of diviner nature, in order to disappear when He chose, is clear from the very nature of the case; and is certain, moreover, from what is recorded of Him, in the judgment of those who do not adopt certain portions merely of the narrative that they may have ground for accusing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and who consider other portions to be fiction. For it is related in St. Luke's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> took bread, and blessed it, and breaking it, distributed it to Simon and Cleopas; and when they had received the bread, <q>their eyes were opened, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him, and He vanished out of their sight.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 69</h2>

<p>But we wish to show that His instantaneous bodily disappearance from the cross was not better fitted to serve the purposes of the whole economy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (than His remaining upon it was). For the mere letter and narrative of the events which happened to Jesus do not present the whole view of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For each one of them can be shown, to those who have an intelligent apprehension of Scripture, to be a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of something else. Accordingly, as His crucifixion contains a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, represented in the words, <q>I am crucified with Christ,</q> and intimated also in these, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid that I should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, save in the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world;</q>  and as His death was necessary, because of the statement, <q>For in that He died, He died unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> once,</q>  and this, <q>Being made conformable to His death,</q>  and this, <q>For if we be dead with Him, we shall also live with Him:</q>  so also His burial has an application to those who have been made conformable to His death, who have been both crucified with Him, and have died with Him; as is declared by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>For we were buried with Him by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and have also risen with Him.</q>  These matters, however, which relate to His burial, and His sepulchre, and him who buried Him, we shall expound at greater length on a more suitable occasion, when it will be our professed purpose to treat of such things. But, for the present, it is sufficient to notice the clean linen in which the pure body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was to be enwrapped, and the new tomb which Joseph had hewn out of the rock, where <q>no one was yet lying,</q>  or, as John expresses it, <q>wherein was never man yet laid.</q>  And observe whether the harmony of the three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> here is not fitted to make an impression: for they have thought it right to describe the tomb as one that was <q>quarried or hewn out of the rock;</q> so that he who examines the words of the narrative may see something worthy of consideration, both in them and in the <em>newness</em> of the tomb&mdash;a point mentioned by Matthew and John &mdash; and in the statement of Luke and John,  that no one had ever been interred therein before. For it became Him, who was unlike other dead men (but who even in death manifested signs of life in the water and the blood), and who was, so to speak, a <em>new</em> dead man, to be laid in a new and clean tomb, in order that, as His birth was purer than any other (in consequence of His being born, not in the way of ordinary generation, but of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>), His burial also might have the purity <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolically</a> indicated in His body being deposited in a sepulchre which was new, not built of stones gathered from various quarters, and having no natural unity, but quarried and hewed out of <em>one</em> rock, united together in all its parts. Regarding the explanation, however, of these points, and the method of ascending from the narratives themselves to the things which they symbolized, one might treat more profoundly, and in a manner more adapted to their divine character, on a more suitable occasion, in a work expressly devoted to such subjects. The literal narrative, however, one might thus explain, viz., that it was appropriate for Him who had resolved to endure suspension upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, to maintain all the accompaniments of the character He had assumed, in order that He who as a man had been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, and who as a man had died, might also as a man be buried. But even if it had been related in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, according to the view of Celsus, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had immediately disappeared from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, he and other unbelievers would have found fault with the narrative, and would have brought against it some such objection as this: <q>Why, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, did he disappear after he had been put upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and not disappear before he suffered?</q> If, then, after learning from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> that He did not at once disappear from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they can find fault with the narrative, because it did not invent, as they consider it ought to have done, any such instantaneous disappearance, but gave a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> account of the matter, is it not reasonable that they should accord their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also to His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, and should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He, according to His pleasure, on one occasion, when the doors were shut, stood in the midst of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and on another, after distributing bread to two of His acquaintances, immediately disappeared from view, after He had spoken to them certain words?</p>

<h2>Chapter 70</h2>

<p>But how is it that this Jew of Celsus could say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> concealed Himself? For his words regarding Him are these: <q>And who that is sent as a messenger ever conceals himself when he ought to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his message?</q> Now, He did not conceal Himself, who said to those who sought to apprehend Him, <q>I was daily teaching openly in the temple, and you laid no hold upon Me.</q> But having once already answered this charge of Celsus, now again repeated, we shall content ourselves with what we have formerly said. We have answered, also, in the preceding pages, this objection, that <q>while he was in the body, and no one <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> upon him, he preached to all without intermission; but when he might have produced a powerful belief in himself after rising from the dead, he showed himself secretly only to one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and to his own boon companions.</q>  Now it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that He showed Himself only to one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; for it is stated in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew, that <q>in the end of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there had been a great earthquake: for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord had descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone.</q>  And, shortly after, Matthew adds: <q>And, behold, Jesus met <em>them</em></q>&mdash; clearly meaning the afore-mentioned Marys&mdash; <q>saying, All hail. And they came and held Him by the feet, and worshipped Him.</q>  And we answered, too, the charge, that <q>while undergoing his punishment he was seen by all, but after his resurrection only by one,</q> when we offered our defence of the fact that <q>He was not seen by all.</q> And now we might say that His merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> attributes were visible to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> but those which were divine in their nature&mdash; I speak of the attributes not as related, but as distinct &mdash; were not capable of being received by all. But observe here the manifest contradiction into which Celsus falls. For having said, a little before, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had appeared secretly to one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and His own boon companions, he immediately subjoins: <q>While undergoing his punishment he was seen by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but after his resurrection by one, whereas the opposite ought to have happened.</q> And let us hear what he means by <q>ought to have happened.</q> The being seen by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> while undergoing His punishment, but after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> only by one individual, are opposites.  Now, so far as his language conveys a meaning, he would have that to take place which is both impossible and absurd, viz., that while undergoing His punishment He should be seen only by one individual, but after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>! Or else how will you explain his words, <q>The opposite ought to have happened?</q></p>

<p>Jesus taught us who it was that sent Him, in the words, <q>None <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father but the Son;</q>  and in these, <q>No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He has declared Him.</q>  He, treating of Deity, stated to His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the doctrine regarding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and we, discovering traces of such teaching in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> narratives, take occasion from such to aid our theological conceptions,  hearing it declared in one passage, that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all;</q>  and in another, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  But the purposes for which the Father sent Him are innumerable; and these any one may ascertain who chooses, partly from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who prophesied of Him, and partly from the narratives of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>. And not a few things also will he learn from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and especially from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Moreover, those who are <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> He leads to the light, and those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> He will punish&mdash;a circumstance which Celsus not observing, has represented Him <q>as one who will lead the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> to the light, and who will have mercy on others, whether they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or repent.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 72</h2>

<p>After the above statements, he continues: <q>If he wished to remain hid, why was there heard a voice from heaven proclaiming him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? And if he did not seek to remain concealed, why was he punished? Or why did he die?</q> Now, by such questions he thinks to convict the histories of discrepancy, not observing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> neither desired all things regarding Himself to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all whom He happened to meet, nor yet all things to be unknown. Accordingly, the voice from heaven which proclaimed Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, in the words, <q>This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased,</q>  is not stated to have been audible to the multitudes, as this Jew of Celsus supposed. The voice from the cloud on the high mountain, moreover, was heard only by those who had gone up with Him. For the divine voice is of such a nature, as to be heard only by those whom the speaker wishes to hear it. And I maintain, that the voice of God which is referred to, is neither air which has been struck, nor any concussion of the air, nor anything else which is mentioned in treatises on the voice;  and therefore it is heard by a better and more divine organ of hearing than that of sense. And when the speaker will not have his voice to be heard by all, he that has the finer ear hears the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while he who has the ears of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> deadened does not perceive that it is God who speaks. These things I have mentioned because of his asking, <q>Why was there heard a voice from heaven proclaiming him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</q> while with respect to the query, <q>Why was he punished, if he wished to remain hid?</q> what has been stated at greater length in the preceding pages on the subject of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> may suffice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 73</h2>

<p>The Jew proceeds, after this, to state as a consequence what does <em>not</em> follow from the premises; for it does not follow from <q>His having wished, by the punishments which He underwent, to teach us also to despise death,</q> that after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> He should openly summon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to the light, and instruct them in the object of His coming. For He had formerly summoned all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to the light in the words, <q>Come unto Me, all you that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</q>  And the object of His coming had been explained at great length in His discourses on the beatitudes, and in the announcements which followed them, and in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, and in His conversations with the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. And the instruction afforded us by the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Gospel of John</a>, shows that the eloquence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> consisted not in words, but in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; while it is manifest from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narratives that His speech was <q>with power,</q> on which account also they marvelled at Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 74</h2>

<p>In addition to all this, the Jew further says: <q>All these statements are taken from your own books, in addition to which we need no other <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; for you fall upon your own swords.</q> </p>

<p>Now we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that many foolish assertions, opposed to the narratives of our <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, occur in the statements of the Jew, either with respect to Jesus or ourselves. And I do not think that he has shown that <q>we fall upon our own swords;</q> but he only so imagines. And when the Jew adds, in a general way, this to his former remarks: <q>O most high and heavenly one! What <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on appearing to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, is received with incredulity?</q> we must say to him, that according to the accounts in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, God is related to have visited the Hebrews in a most public manner, not only in the signs and wonders performed in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and also in the passage of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, and in the pillar of fire and cloud of light, but also when the Decalogue was announced to the whole people, and yet was received with incredulity by those who saw these things: for had they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> what they saw and heard, they would not have fashioned the calf, nor changed their own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> into the likeness of a grass-eating calf; nor would they have said to one another with reference to the calf, <q>These be your gods, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who brought you up out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q>  And observe whether it is not entirely in keeping with the character of the same people, who formerly refused to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> such wonders and such appearances of divinity, throughout the whole period of wandering in the wilderness, as they are recorded in the law of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to have done, to refuse to be convinced also, on occasion of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, by the mighty words which were spoken by Him with authority, and the marvels which He performed in the presence of all the people.</p>

<h2>Chapter 75</h2>

<p>I think what has been stated is enough to convince any one that the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> with regard to Jesus was in keeping with what is related of this people from the beginning. For I would say in reply to this Jew of Celsus, when he asks, <q>What God that appeared among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is received with incredulity, and that, too, when appearing to those who expect him? Or why, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, is he not recognized by those who have been long looking for him?</q> what answer, friends, would you have us return to your  questions? Which class of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, in your judgment, do you regard as the greater? Those which were wrought in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the wilderness, or those which we declare that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> performed among you? For if the former are in your opinion greater than the latter, does it not appear from this very fact to be in conformity with the character of those who disbelieved the greater to despise the less? And this is the opinion entertained with respect to our accounts of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of Jesus. But if those related of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> are considered to be as great as those recorded of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, what strange thing has come to pass among a nation which has manifested incredulity with regard to the commencement of both dispensations?  For the beginning of the legislation was in the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, in whose work are recorded the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the unbelievers and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> among you, while the commencement of our legislation and second covenant is admitted to have been in the time of Jesus. And by your unbelief of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> you show that you are the sons of those who in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> discredited the divine appearances; and thus what was spoken by our Saviour will be applicable also to you who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not on Him: <q>Therefore you bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that you allow the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of your fathers.</q>  And there is fulfilled among you also the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which said: <q>Your life shall hang in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> before your eyes, and you will have no assurance of your life.</q>  For you did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the life which came to visit the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 76</h2>

<p>Celsus, in adopting the character of a Jew, could not discover any objections to be urged against the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which might not be retorted on him as liable to be brought also against the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For he censures Jesus in such words as the following: <q>He makes use of threats, and reviles men on light grounds, when he says, 'Woe unto you,' and 'I tell you beforehand.' For by such expressions he manifestly acknowledges his inability to persuade; and this would not be the case with a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or even a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man.</q> Observe, now, whether these charges do not manifestly recoil upon the Jew. For in the writings of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> God makes use of threats and revilings, when He employs language of not less severity than that found in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, such as the following expressions of Isaiah: <q>Woe unto them that join house to house, and lay field to field;</q>  and, <q>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink;</q>  and, <q>Woe unto them that draw their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> after them as with a long rope;</q>  and, <q>Woe unto them that call <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> good, and good <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;</q>  and, <q>Woe unto those of you who are mighty to drink wine;</q>  and innumerable other passages of the same kind. And does not the following resemble the threats of which he speaks: <q>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters?</q>  and so on, to which he subjoins such threats as are equal in severity to those which, he says, Jesus made use of. For is it not a threatening, and a great one, which declares, <q>Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers?</q>  And are there not revilings in Ezekiel directed against the people, when the Lord says to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>You dwell in the midst of scorpions?</q>  Were you serious, then, Celsus, in representing the Jew as saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that <q>he makes use of threats and revilings on slight grounds, when he employs the expressions, 'Woe unto you,' and 'I tell you beforehand?'</q> Do you not see that the charges which this Jew of yours brings against Jesus might be brought by him against God? For the God who speaks in the prophetic writings is manifestly liable to the same accusations, as Celsus regards them, of inability to persuade. I might, moreover, say to this Jew, who thinks that he makes a good charge against Jesus by such statements, that if he undertakes, in support of the scriptural account, to defend the numerous curses recorded in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, we should make as good, or better, a defence of the revilings and threatenings which are regarded as having been spoken by Jesus. And as respects the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> itself, we are in a position to make a better defence of it than the Jew is, because we have been taught by Jesus to have a more intelligent apprehension of the writings of the law. Nay, if the Jew perceive the meaning of the prophetic Scriptures, he will be able to show that it is for no light reason that God employs threatenings and revilings, when He says, <q>Woe unto you,</q> and <q>I tell you beforehand.</q> And how should God employ such expressions for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which Celsus thinks that even a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man would not have recourse to? But <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only one God&mdash; the same who spoke in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and in the Lord (Jesus)&mdash; can prove the reasonableness of those threatenings and revilings, as Celsus considers and entitles them. And here a few remarks shall be addressed to this Celsus, who professes both to be a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and to be acquainted with all our system. How is it, friend, when Hermes, in Homer, says to Odysseus,</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Why, now, wretched man, do you come wandering alone over the mountain-tops?</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>that you are satisfied with the answer, which explains that the Homeric Hermes addresses such language to Odysseus to remind him of his duty,  because it is characteristic of the Sirens to flatter and to say pleasing things, around whom</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Is a huge heap of bones,</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>and who say,</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Come here, much lauded Odysseus, great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Greeks;</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>whereas, if our <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and Jesus Himself, in order to turn their hearers from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, make use of such expressions as <q>Woe unto you,</q> and what you regard as revilings, there is no condescension in such language to the circumstances of the hearers, nor any application of such words to them as healing  medicine? Unless, indeed, you would have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or one who partakes of the divine nature, when conversing with men, to have regard to His own nature alone, and to what is worthy of Himself, but to have no regard to what is fitting to be brought before men who are under the dispensation and leading of His word, and with each one of whom He is to converse agreeably to his individual character. And is it not a ridiculous assertion regarding Jesus, to say that He was unable to persuade men, when you compare the state of matters not only among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who have many such instances recorded in the prophecies, but also among the Greeks, among whom all of those who have attained great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for their wisdom have been unable to persuade those who conspired against them, or to induce their judges or accusers to cease from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and to endeavour to attain to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by the way of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 77</h2>

<p>After this the Jew remarks, manifestly in accordance with the Jewish belief: <q>We certainly hope that there will be a bodily resurrection, and that we shall enjoy an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; and the example and archetype of this will be He who is sent to us, and who will show that nothing is impossible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, indeed, whether the Jew would say of the expected Christ, that He exhibits in Himself an example of the resurrection; but let it be supposed that he both thinks and says so. We shall give this answer, then, to him who has told us that he drew his information from our own writings: <q>Did you read those writings, friend, in which you think you discover matter of accusation against us, and not find there the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and the declaration that He was the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> from the dead? Or because you will not allow such things to have been recorded, were they not actually recorded?</q> But as the Jew still admits the resurrection of the body, I do not consider the present a suitable time to discuss the subject with one who both believes and says that there is a bodily resurrection, whether he has an articulate  understanding of such a topic, and is able to plead well on its behalf,  or not, but has only given his assent to it as being of a legendary character.  Let the above, then, be our reply to this Jew of Celsus. And when he adds, <q>Where, then, is he, that we may see him and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> upon him?</q> we answer: Where is He now who spoke in the prophecies, and who wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, that we may see and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is part of God? Are <em>you</em> to be allowed to meet the objection, that God does not perpetually show Himself to the Hebrew nation, while we are not to be permitted the same defence with regard to Jesus, who has both once risen Himself, and led His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, and so thoroughly persuaded them of its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that they show to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by their sufferings how they are able to laugh at all the troubles of life, beholding the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and the resurrection clearly demonstrated to them both in word and deed?</p>

<h2>Chapter 78</h2>

<p>The Jew continues: <q>Did Jesus come into the world for this purpose, that we should not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him?</q> To which we immediately answer, that He did not come with the object of producing incredulity among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> beforehand that such would be the result, He foretold it, and made use of their unbelief for the calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For through their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> came to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, respecting whom the Christ who speaks in the prophecies says, <q>A people whom I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> became subject to Me: they were <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the hearing of My ear;</q>  and, <q>I was found of them who sought Me not; I became manifest to those who inquired not after Me.</q>  It is certain, moreover, that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were punished even in this present life, after treating Jesus in the manner in which they did. And let the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> assert what they will when we charge them with guilt, and say, <q>Is not the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and goodness of God most wonderfully displayed in your punishment, and in your being deprived of Jerusalem, and of the sanctuary, and of your splendid worship?</q> For whatever they may say in reply with respect to the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we shall be able more effectually to answer it by remarking, that the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God was wonderfully manifested in using the transgression of that people for the purpose of calling into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, those from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who were strangers to the covenant and aliens to the promises. And these things were foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who said that, on account of the transgressions of the Hebrew nation, God would make choice, not of a nation, but of individuals chosen from all lands;  and, having selected the foolish things of the world, would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> nation to become acquainted with the divine teaching, the kingdom of God being taken from the one and given to the other. And out of a larger number it is sufficient on the present occasion to adduce the prediction from the song in Deuteronomy regarding the calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which is as follows, being spoken in the person of the Lord: <q>They have moved Me to jealousy with those who are not gods; they have provoked Me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: and I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with a foolish nation.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 79</h2>

<p>The conclusion of all these arguments regarding Jesus is thus stated by the Jew: <q>He was therefore a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and of such a nature, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself proves, and reason demonstrates him to be.</q> I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, whether a man who had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to spread throughout the entire world his doctrine of religious worship and teaching,  could accomplish what he wished without the divine assistance, and could rise superior to all who withstood the progress of his doctrine&mdash; kings and rulers, and the Roman senate, and governors in all places, and the common people. And how could the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a man possessed of no inherent excellence convert so vast a multitude? For it would not be wonderful if it were only the wise who were so convened; but it is the most irrational of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and those devoted to their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and who, by reason of their irrationality, change with the greater difficulty so as to adopt a more temperate course of life. And yet it is because Christ was the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of the Father that He accomplished, and still accomplishes, such results, although neither the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> nor Greeks who disbelieve His word will so admit. And therefore we shall not cease to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the precepts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and to seek to convert those who are blind on the subject of religion, although it is they who are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blind themselves that charge us with blindness: and they, whether <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or Greeks, who lead astray those that follow them, accuse us of seducing men&mdash; a good seduction, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>!&mdash; that they may become temperate instead of dissolute, or at least may make advances to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>; may become just instead of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, or at least may tend to become so; <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> instead of foolish, or be on the way to become such; and instead of cowardice, meanness, and timidity, may exhibit the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, especially displayed in the struggles undergone for the sake of their religion towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of all things. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> therefore came announced beforehand, not by one <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, but by all; and it was a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of Celsus, to represent a Jew as saying that one <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> only had predicted the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But as this Jew of Celsus, after being thus introduced, asserting that these things were indeed in conformity with his own law, has somewhere here ended his discourse, with a mention of other matters not worthy of remembrance, I too shall here terminate this second book of my answer to his treatise. But if God permit, and the power of Christ abide in my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, I shall endeavour in the third book to deal with the subsequent statements of Celsus.</p>
