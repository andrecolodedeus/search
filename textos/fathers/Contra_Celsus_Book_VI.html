<h1>Contra Celsus, Book VI</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>In beginning this our sixth book, we desire, my reverend Ambrosius, to answer in it those accusations which Celsus brings against the <em><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a></em>, not, as might be supposed, those objections which he has adduced from <em>writers on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a></em>. For he has quoted a considerable number of passages, chiefly from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and has placed alongside of these such declarations of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture as are fitted to impress even the intelligent mind; subjoining the assertion that <q>these things are stated much better among the Greeks (than in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>), and in a manner which is free from all exaggerations  and promises on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> Now we maintain, that if it is the object of the ambassadors of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to confer benefits upon the greatest possible number, and, so far as they can, to win over to its side, through their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, every one without exception&mdash; intelligent as well as simple&mdash; not Greeks only, but also Barbarians (and great, indeed, is the humanity which should succeed in converting the rustic and the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> ), it is manifest that they must adopt a style of address fitted to do good to all, and to gain over to them men of every sort. Those, on the other hand, who turn away  from the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> as being mere slaves,  and unable to understand the flowing periods of a polished and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> discourse, and so devote their attention solely to such as have been brought up among literary pursuits,  confine their views of the public good within very strait and narrow limits.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>I have made these remarks in reply to the charges which Celsus and others bring against the simplicity of the language of Scripture, which appears to be thrown into the shade by the splendour of polished discourse. For our <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and Jesus Himself, and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, were careful to adopt  a style of address which should not merely convey the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but which should be fitted to gain over the multitude, until each one, attracted and led onwards, should ascend as far as he could towards the comprehension of those <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which are contained in these apparently simple words. For, if I may venture to say so, few have been benefited (if they have indeed been benefited at all) by the beautiful and polished style of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and those who have written like him;  while, on the contrary, many have received advantage from those who wrote and taught in a simple and practical manner, and with a view to the wants of the multitude. It is easy, indeed, to observe that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is found only in the hands of those who profess to be literary men;  while Epictetus is admired by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of ordinary capacity, who have a desire to be benefited, and who perceive the improvement which may be derived from his writings. Now we make these remarks, not to disparage <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> (for the great world of men has found even him useful), but to point out the aim of those who said: <q>And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should not stand in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  For the word of God declares that the preaching (although in itself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and most worthy of belief) is not sufficient to reach the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart, unless a certain power be imparted to the speaker from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> appear upon his words; and it is only by the divine agency that this takes place in those who speak effectually. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says in the <a href="../bible/psa066.htm">sixty-seventh Psalm</a>, that <q>the Lord will give a word with great power to them who preach.</q>  If, then, it should be granted with respect to certain points, that the same doctrines are found among the Greeks as in our own Scriptures, yet they do not possess the same power of attracting and disposing the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men to follow them. And therefore the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, men <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> so far as regards Grecian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, yet traversed many countries of the world, impressing, agreeably to the desire of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, each one of their hearers according to his deserts, so that they received a moral amelioration in proportion to the inclination of their will to accept of that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Let the ancient sages, then, make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> their sayings to those who are capable of understanding them. Suppose that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, for example, the son of Ariston, in one of his Epistles, is discoursing about the <q>chief good,</q> and that he says, <q>The chief good can by no means be described in words, but is produced by long habit, and bursts forth suddenly as a light in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as from a fire which had leapt forth.</q> We, then, on hearing these words, admit that they are well said, for it is God who revealed to men these as well as all other noble expressions. And for this reason it is that we maintain that those who have entertained correct ideas regarding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but who have not offered to Him a worship in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, are liable to the punishments which fall on sinners. For respecting such <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says in express words: <q>The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness; because that which may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it unto them. For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: because that, when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, then, is verily held (in unrighteousness), as our Scriptures testify, by those who are of opinion that <q>the chief good cannot be described in words,</q> but who assert that, <q>after long custom and familiar usage,  a light becomes suddenly kindled in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as if by a fire springing forth, and that it now supports itself alone.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>Notwithstanding, those who have written in this manner regarding the <q>chief good</q> will go down to the Pir&aelig;us and offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to Artemis, as if she were <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and will look (with approval) upon the solemn assembly held by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men; and after giving utterance to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> remarks of such profundity regarding the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and describing its passage (to a happier world) after a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life, they pass from those great topics which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has revealed to them, and adopt mean and trifling thoughts, and offer a cock to &AElig;sculapius!  And although they had been enabled to form representations both of the <q>invisible things</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the <q>archetypal forms</q> of things from the creation of the world, and from (the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of) sensible things, from which they ascend to those objects which are comprehended by the understanding alone&mdash;and although they had no mean glimpses of His <q><a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power and Godhead,</q>  they nevertheless became <q>foolish in their imaginations,</q> and their <q>foolish heart</q> was involved in darkness and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> as to the (<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>) worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover, we may see those who greatly <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves upon their wisdom and theology worshipping the image of a corruptible man, <em>in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a></em>, they say, of Him, and sometimes even descending, with the Egyptians, to the worship of birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things! And although some may appear to have risen above such practices, nevertheless they will be found to have changed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of God into a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, and to worship and serve the <q>creature more than the Creator.</q>  As the wise and learned among the Greeks, then, commit <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in the service which they render to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God <q>chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and base things of the world, and things that are weak, and things which are despised, and things which are nought, to bring to nought things that are;</q> and this, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, <q>that no flesh should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  <em>Our</em> wise men, however&mdash;<a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the most ancient of them all, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who followed him&mdash;<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the chief good could by no means be described in words, were the first who wrote that, as God manifests Himself to the deserving, and to those who are qualified to behold Him,  He appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, or to Isaac, or to Jacob. But who He was that appeared, and of what form, and in what manner, and like to which of mortal beings,  they have left to be investigated by those who are able to show that they resemble those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom God showed Himself: for He was seen not by their bodily eyes, but by the pure heart. For, according to the declaration of our Jesus, <q>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>But that a light is suddenly kindled in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as by a fire leaping forth, is a fact <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> long ago to our Scriptures; as when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said, <q>Light for yourselves the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q>  John also, who lived after him, said, <q>That which was in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> was life, and the life was the light of men;</q>  which <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light lightens every man that comes into the world</q> (i.e., the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> world, which is perceived by the understanding ), and makes him a light of the world: For this light shone in our hearts, to give the light of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the face of Christ Jesus.  And therefore that very ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who prophesied many generations before the reign of Cyrus (for he was older than he by more than fourteen generations), expressed himself in these words: <q>The Lord is my light and my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: whom shall I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>?</q>  and, <q>Your law is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path;</q>  and again, <q>The light of Your countenance, O Lord, was manifested towards us;</q>  and, <q>In Your light we shall see light.</q>  And the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, exhorting us to come to this light, says, in the prophecies of Isaiah: <q>Enlighten yourself, enlighten yourself, O Jerusalem; for your light has come, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord is risen upon you.</q>  The same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> also, when predicting the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, who was to turn away men from the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and of images, and of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, says, <q>To those that sat in the land and shadow of death, upon them has the light arisen;</q>  and again, <q>The people that sat in darkness saw a great light.</q>  Observe now the difference between the fine phrases of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> respecting the <q>chief good,</q> and the declarations of our <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> regarding the <q>light</q> of the blessed; and notice that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as it is contained in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> concerning this subject did not at all help his readers to attain to a pure worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor even himself, who could philosophize so grandly about the <q>chief good,</q> whereas the simple language of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> has led to their honest readers being filled with a divine spirit;  and this light is nourished within them by the oil, which in a certain <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> is said to have preserved the light of the torches of the five wise <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>Seeing, however, that Celsus quotes from an epistle of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> another statement to the following effect, viz.: <q>If it appeared to me that these matters could be adequately explained to the multitude in writing and in oral address, what nobler pursuit in life could have been followed by me, than to commit to writing what was to prove of such advantage to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, and to lead the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> onwards to the light?</q>&mdash; let us then consider this point briefly, viz., whether or not <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> were acquainted with any doctrines more profound than are contained in his writings, or more divine than those which he has left behind him, leaving it to each one to investigate the subject according to his ability, while we demonstrate that our <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of greater things than any in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, but which they did not commit to writing. Ezekiel, e.g., received a roll,  written within and without, in which were contained <q>lamentations,</q> and <q>songs,</q> and <q>denunciations;</q>  but at the command of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> he swallowed the book, in order that its contents might not be written, and so made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to unworthy <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. John also is recorded to have seen and done a similar thing.  Nay, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> even heard <q>unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</q>  And it is related of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, who was greater than all these, that He conversed with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in private, and especially in their sacred retreats, concerning the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but the words which He uttered have not been preserved, because it appeared to the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> that they could not be adequately conveyed to the multitude in writing or in speech. And if it were not tiresome to repeat the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> regarding these illustrious individuals, I would say that they saw better than <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> (by means of the intelligence which they received by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God), what things were to be committed to <em>writing</em>, and how this was to be done, and what was by no means to be written to the multitude, and what was to be expressed in <em>words</em>, and what was not to be so conveyed. And once more, John, in teaching us the difference between what ought to be committed to writing and what not, declares that he heard seven thunders instructing him on certain matters, and forbidding him to commit their words to writing. </p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>There might also be found in the writings of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who are older not only than <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, but even than Homer and the invention of letters among the Greeks, passages worthy of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God bestowed upon them, and filled with great thoughts, to which they gave utterance, but not because they understood <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> imperfectly, as Celsus imagines. For how was it possible that they should have heard one who was not yet born? And if any one should apply the words of Celsus to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, who were younger than <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, say whether it is not on the very face of it an incredible assertion, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the tentmaker, and Peter the fisherman, and John who left his father's nets, should, through misunderstanding the language of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in his Epistles, have expressed themselves as they have done regarding God? But as Celsus now, after having often required of us immediate assent (to his views), as if he were babbling forth something new in addition to what he has already advanced, only repeats himself,  what we have said in reply may suffice. Seeing, however, he produces another quotation from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, in which he asserts that the employment of the method of question and answer sheds light on the thoughts of those who philosophize like him, let us show from the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> that the word of God also encourages us to the practice of dialectics: Solomon, e.g., declaring in one passage, that <q>instruction unquestioned goes astray;</q>  and Jesus the son of Sirach, who has left us the treatise called <q>Wisdom,</q> declaring in another, that <q>the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the unwise is as words that will not stand investigation.</q>  Our methods of discussion, however, are rather of a gentle kind; for we have learned that he who presides over the preaching of the word ought to be able to confute gainsayers. But if some continue indolent, and do not train themselves so as to attend to the reading of the word, and <q>to search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>,</q> and, agreeably to the command of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, to investigate the <em>meaning</em> of the sacred writings, and to ask of God concerning them, and to keep <q>knocking</q> at what may be closed within them, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> is not on that account to be regarded as devoid of wisdom.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>In the next place, after other <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> declarations, which demonstrate that <q>the good</q> can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by few, he adds: <q>Since the multitude, being puffed up with a contempt for others, which is far from right, and being filled with vain and lofty hopes, assert that, because they have come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of some venerable doctrines, certain things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q> <q>Yet although <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> predicted these things, he nevertheless does not talk marvels,  nor shut the mouth of those who wish to ask him for information on the subject of his promises; nor does he command them to come at once and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that a God of a particular kind exists, and that he has a son of a particular nature, who descended (to earth) and conversed with me.</q> Now, in answer to this we have to say, that with regard to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, it is Aristander, I think, who has related that he was not the son of Ariston, but of a phantom, which approached Amphictione in the guise of Apollo. And there are several other of the followers of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> who, in their lives of their master, have made the same statement. What are we to say, moreover, about Pythagoras, who relates the greatest possible amount of wonders, and who, in a general assembly of the Greeks, showed his ivory thigh, and asserted that he recognised the shield which he wore when he was Euphorbus, and who is said to have appeared on one day in two different cities! He, moreover, who will declare that what is related of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Socrates belongs to the marvellous, will quote the story of the swan which was recommended to Socrates while he was asleep, and of the master saying when he met the young man, <q>This, then, was the swan!</q>  Nay, the third eye which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> saw that he himself possessed, he will refer to the category of prodigies.  But occasion for <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> accusations will never be wanting to those who are ill-disposed, and who wish to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of what has happened to such as are raised above the multitude. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> will deride as a fiction even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> of Socrates. We do not, then, relate marvels when we narrate the history of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, nor have His genuine <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> recorded any such stories of Him; whereas this Celsus, who professes universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and who quotes many of the sayings of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, is, I think, intentionally silent on the discourse concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> which is related in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> Epistle to Hermeas and Coriscus. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> words are as follows: <q>And calling to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things&mdash; the ruler both of things present and things to come, father and lord both of the ruler and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>&mdash; whom, if we are <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> indeed, we shall all clearly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, so far as it is possible for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings to attain such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>Celsus quotes another saying of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> to the following effect: <q>It has occurred to me to speak once more upon these subjects at greater length, as perhaps I might express myself about them more clearly than I have already done for there is a certain 'real' <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which proves a hindrance in the way of him who has ventured, even to a slight extent, to write on such topics; and as this has been frequently mentioned by me on former occasions, it appears to me that it ought to be stated now. In each of existing things, which are necessarily employed in the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, there are three elements; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself is the fourth; and that ought to be laid down as the fifth which is both capable of being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Of these, one is 'name;' the second is 'word;' the third, 'image;' the fourth, '<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.'</q>  Now, according to this division, John is introduced before Jesus as the voice of one crying in the wilderness, so as to correspond with the <q>name</q> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>; and the second after John, who is pointed out by him, is Jesus, with whom agrees the statement, <q>The Word became flesh;</q> and that corresponds to the <q>word</q> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> terms the third <q>image;</q> but we, who apply the expression <q>image</q> to something different, would say with greater precision, that the mark of the wounds which is made in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the word is the Christ which is in each one of us and this mark is impressed by Christ the Word.  And whether Christ, the wisdom which is in those of us who are perfect, correspond to the <q>fourth</q> element&mdash; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>&mdash; will become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him who has the capacity to ascertain it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>He next continues: <q>You see how <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, although maintaining that (the chief good) cannot be described in words, yet, to avoid the appearance of retreating to an irrefutable position, subjoins a reason in explanation of this difficulty, as even 'nothing'  might perhaps be explained in words.</q> But as Celsus adduces this to prove that we ought not to yield a simple assent, but to furnish a reason for our belief, we shall quote also the words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, where he says, in censuring the hasty  believer, <q>unless you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> inconsiderately.</q>  Now, through his practice of repeating himself, Celsus, so far as he can, forces us to be guilty of tautology, reiterating, after the boastful language which has been quoted, that <q><a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is not guilty of boasting and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, giving out that he has made some new discovery, or that he has come down from heaven to announce it, but acknowledges whence these statements are derived.</q> Now, if one wished to reply to Celsus, one might say in answer to such assertions, that even <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is guilty of boasting, when in the <em>Tim&aelig;us</em>  he puts the following language in the month of Zeus: <q>Gods of gods, whose creator and father I am,</q> and so on. And if any one will defend such language on account of the meaning which is conveyed under the name of Zeus, thus speaking in the dialogue of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, why should not he who investigates the meaning of the words of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, or those of the Creator  in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, express a profounder meaning than any conveyed by the words of Zeus in the <em>Tim&aelig;us</em>? For the characteristic of divinity is the announcement of future events, predicted not by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power, but shown by the result to be due to a divine spirit in him who made the announcement. Accordingly, we do not say to each of our hearers, <q>Believe, first of all, that He whom I introduce to you is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</q> but we put the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> before each one, as his character and disposition may fit him to receive it, inasmuch as we have learned to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <q>how we ought to answer every man.</q>  And there are some who are capable of receiving nothing more than an exhortation to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and to these we address that alone; while we approach others, again, as far as possible, in the way of demonstration, by means of question and answer. Nor do we at all say, as Celsus scoffingly alleges, <q>Believe that he whom I introduce to you is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, although he was shamefully bound, and disgracefully punished, and very recently  was most contumeliously treated before the eyes of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>;</q> neither do we add, <q>Believe it even the more (on that account).</q> For it is our endeavour to state, on each individual point, arguments more numerous even than we have brought forward in the preceding pages.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>After this Celsus continues: <q>If these (meaning the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>) bring forward this person, and others, again, a different individual (as the Christ), while the common and ready cry  of all parties is, 'Believe, if you will be saved, or else begone,' what shall those do who are in earnest about their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? Shall they cast the dice, in order to divine whither they may betake themselves, and whom they shall join?</q> Now we shall answer this objection in the following manner, as the clearness of the case impels us to do. If it had been recorded that several individuals had appeared in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life as sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the manner in which Jesus did, and if each of them had drawn a party of adherents to his side, so that, on account of the similarity of the profession (in the case of each individual) that he was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, he to whom his followers bore testimony to that effect was an object of dispute, there would have been ground for his saying, <q>If these bring forward this person, and others a different individual, while the common and ready cry of all parties is, 'Believe, if you will be saved, or else begone,'</q> and so on; whereas it has been proclaimed to the entire world that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> who visited the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>: for those who, like Celsus, have supposed that (the acts of Jesus) were a series of prodigies,  and who for that reason wished to perform acts of the same kind,  that they, too, might gain a similar mastery over the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, were convicted of being utter nonentities.  Such were Simon, the Magus of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a>, who was a native of the same place; since the former gave out that he was the power of God that is called great,  and the latter that he was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/13797a.htm">Simonians</a> are found nowhere throughout the world; and yet, in order to gain over to himself many followers, Simon freed his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> from the danger of death, which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were taught to prefer, by teaching them to regard <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> as a matter of indifference. But even at the beginning of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> the followers of Simon were not exposed to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. For that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> who was conspiring against the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, was well aware that none of his own maxims would be weakened by the teaching of Simon. The <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheans</a>, again, even in former times, did not rise to any eminence, and now they are completely extinguished, so that it is said their whole number does not amount to thirty. Judas of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> also, as Luke relates in the Acts of the Apostles,  wished to call himself some great personage, as did Theudas before him; but as their doctrine was not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they were destroyed, and all who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> them were immediately dispersed. We do not, then, <q>cast the dice in order to divine whither we shall betake ourselves, and whom we shall join,</q> as if there were many claimants able to draw us after them by the profession of their having come down from God to visit the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. On these points, however, we have said enough.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>Accordingly, let us pass on to another charge made by Celsus, who is not even acquainted with the words (of our sacred books), but who, from misunderstanding them, has said that <q>we declare the wisdom that is among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> having said that <q>the wisdom of the <em>world</em> is foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Celsus says that <q>the reason of this has been stated long ago.</q> And the reason he imagines to be, <q>our desire to win over by means of this saying the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and foolish alone.</q> But, as he himself has intimated, he has said the same thing before; and we, to the best of our ability, replied to it. Notwithstanding this, however, he wished to show that this statement was an invention  of ours, and borrowed from the Grecian sages, who declare that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom is of one kind, and divine of another. And he quotes the words of Heraclitus, where he says in one passage, that <q>man's method of action is not regulated by fixed principles, but that of God is;</q>  and in another, that <q>a foolish man listens to a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, as a boy does to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> He quotes, moreover, the following from the <em>Apology of Socrates</em>, of which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> was the author: <q>For I, O men of Athens, have obtained this name by no other means than by my wisdom. And of what sort is this wisdom? Such, probably, as is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>; for in that respect I venture to think that I am in reality wise.</q>  Such are the passages adduced by Celsus. But I shall subjoin also the following from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> letter to Hermeas, and Erastus, and Coriscus: <q>To Erastus and Coriscus I say, although I am an old man, that, in addition to this noble <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of 'forms' (which they possess), they need a wisdom, with regard to the class of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, which may serve as a protective and repelling force against them. For they are inexperienced, in consequence of having passed a large portion of their lives with us, who are moderate  individuals, and not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. I have accordingly said that they need these things, in order that they may not be compelled to neglect the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom, and to apply themselves in a greater degree than is proper to that which is necessary and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>According to the foregoing, then, the one kind of wisdom is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and the other divine. Now the <q><a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a></q> wisdom is that which is termed by us the wisdom of the <q>world,</q> which is <q>foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> whereas the <q>divine</q>&mdash; being different from the <q><a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>,</q> because it is <q>divine</q>&mdash; comes, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God who bestows it, to those who have evinced their capacity for receiving it, and especially to those who, from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the difference between either kind of wisdom, say, in their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Even if one among the sons of men be perfect, while the wisdom is wanting that comes from You, he shall be accounted as nothing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note044343"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse6">Wisdom&nbsp;9:6</a></span> We maintain, indeed, that <q><a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a></q> wisdom is an exercise for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but that <q>divine</q> wisdom is the <q>end,</q> being also termed the <q>strong</q> meat of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by him who has said that <q>strong meat belongs to them that are perfect,  even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  This opinion, moreover, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> an ancient one, its antiquity not being referred back, as Celsus thinks, merely to Heraclitus and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. For before these individuals lived, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> distinguished between the two kinds of wisdom. It is sufficient for the present to quote from the words of David what he says regarding the man who is wise, according to divine wisdom, that <q>he will not see corruption when he beholds wise men dying.</q>  Divine wisdom, accordingly, being different from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is the <q>first</q> of the so-called <q>charismata</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the <q>second</q> after it&mdash; in the estimation of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to distinguish such things accurately&mdash; is what is called <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>;</q>  and the <q>third</q>&mdash; seeing that even the more simple class of men who adhere to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so far as they can, must be saved&mdash; is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: <q>To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the same Spirit; to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the same Spirit.</q>  And therefore it is no ordinary individuals whom you will find to have participated in the <q>divine</q> wisdom, but the more excellent and distinguished among those who have given in their adherence to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; for it is not <q>to the most <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, or servile, or most uninstructed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>,</q> that one would discourse upon the topics relating to the divine wisdom.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>In designating others by the epithets of <q>uninstructed, and servile, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>,</q> Celsus, I suppose, means those who are not acquainted with his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, nor trained in the branches of Greek learning; while we, on the other hand, deem those to be <q>uninstructed</q> who are not ashamed to address (supplications) to inanimate objects, and to call upon those for health that have no strength, and to ask the dead for life, and to entreat the helpless for assistance.  And although some may say that these objects are not gods, but only imitations and <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of real divinities, nevertheless these very individuals, in imagining that the hands of low mechanics  can frame imitations of divinity, are <q>uninstructed, and servile, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>;</q> for we assert that the lowest  among us have been set free from this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and want of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, while the most intelligent can understand and grasp the divine hope. We do <em>not</em> maintain, however, that it is impossible for one who has not been trained in earthly wisdom to receive the <q>divine,</q> but we <em>do</em> acknowledge that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom is <q>folly</q> in comparison with the <q>divine.</q> In the next place, instead of endeavouring to adduce reasons, as he ought, for his assertions, he terms us <q>sorcerers,</q>  and asserts that <q>we flee away with headlong speed  from the more polished  class of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, because they are not suitable subjects for our impositions, while we seek to decoy  those who are more rustic.</q> Now he did not observe that from the very beginning our wise men were trained in the external branches of learning: <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, e.g., in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; Daniel, and Ananias, and Azariah, and Mishael, in all Assyrian learning, so that they were found to surpass in tenfold degree all the wise men of that country. At the present time, moreover, the Churches have, in proportion to the multitudes (of ordinary <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>), a few <q>wise</q> men, who have come over to them from that wisdom which is said by us to be <q>according to the flesh;</q>  and they have also some who have advanced from it to that wisdom which is <q>divine.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>Celsus, in the next place, as one who has heard the subject of humility greatly talked about,  but who has not been at the pains to understand it,  would wish to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of that humility which is practised among us, and imagines that it is borrowed from some words of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> imperfectly understood, where he expresses himself in the <em>Laws</em> as follows: <q>Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the ancient account, having in Himself both the beginning and end and middle of all existing things, proceeds according to nature, and marches straight on.  He is constantly followed by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is the avenger of all breaches of the divine law: he who is about to become <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> follows her closely in humility, and becomingly adorned.</q>  He did not observe, however, that in writers much older than <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> the following words occur in a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: <q>Lord, my heart is not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a>, nor my eyes lofty, neither do I walk in great matters, nor in things too wonderful for me; if I had not been <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>,</q>  etc. Now these words show that he who is of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> mind does not by any means <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> himself in an unseemly or inauspicious manner, falling down upon his knees, or casting himself headlong on the ground, putting on the dress of the miserable, or sprinkling himself with dust. But he who is of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> mind in the sense of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, while <q>walking in great and wonderful things,</q> which are above his capacity&mdash; viz., those doctrines that are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> great, and those thoughts that are wonderful&mdash; <q>humbles himself under the mighty hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> If there are some, however, who through their stupidity  have not clearly understood the doctrine of humiliation, and act as they do, it is not our doctrine which is to be blamed; but we must extend our forgiveness to the stupidity  of those who aim at higher things, and owing to their fatuity of mind  fail to attain them. He who is <q><a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and becomingly adorned,</q> is so in a greater degree than <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> <q><a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and becomingly adorned</q> individual: for he is becomingly adorned, on the one hand, because <q>he walks in things great and wonderful,</q> which are beyond his capacity; and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, on the other hand, because, while being in the midst of such, he yet voluntarily humbles himself, not under any one at random, but under <q>the mighty hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the teacher of such instruction, <q>who did not deem equality with God a thing to be eagerly clung to, but made Himself of no <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, and took on Him the form of a servant, and being found in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, humbled Himself, and became <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, even the death of the cross.</q>  And so great is this doctrine of humiliation, that it has no ordinary individual as its teacher; but our great Saviour Himself says: <q>Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart, and you shall find rest for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q> </p>

<p>In the next place, with regard to the declaration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> against rich men, when He said, <q>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,</q>  Celsus alleges that this saying manifestly proceeded from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> perverted the words of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, which were, that <q>it was impossible to be distinguished for goodness, and at the same time for riches.</q>  Now who is there that is capable of giving even moderate attention to affairs&mdash; not merely among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> on Jesus, but among the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>&mdash; that would not laugh at Celsus, on hearing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, who was born and brought up among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and was supposed to be the son of Joseph the carpenter, and who had not studied literature&mdash; not merely that of the Greeks, but not even that of the Hebrews&mdash; as the truth-loving Scriptures testify regarding Him,  had read <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and being pleased with the opinion he expressed regarding rich men, to the effect that <q>it was impossible to be distinguished for goodness and riches at the same time,</q> had perverted this, and changed it into, <q>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God!</q> Now, if Celsus had not perused the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> in a spirit of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and dislike, but had been imbued with a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he would have turned his attention to the point why a camel&mdash; that one of animals which, as regards its physical structure, is crooked&mdash; was chosen as an object of comparison with a rich man, and what signification the <q>narrow eye of a needle</q> had for him who saw that <q>strait and narrow was the way that leads unto life;</q>  and to this point also, that this animal. according to the law, is described as <q>unclean,</q> having one element of acceptability, viz. that it ruminates, but one of condemnation, viz., that it does not divide the hoof. He would have inquired, moreover, how often the camel was adduced as an object of comparison in the sacred Scriptures, and in reference to what objects, that he might thus ascertain the meaning  of the <span class="greek"><a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a></span> concerning the rich men. Nor would he have left without examination the fact that <q>the poor</q> are termed <q>blessed</q> by Jesus, while <q>the rich</q> are designated as <q>miserable;</q> and whether these words refer to the rich and poor who are visible to the senses, or whether there is any kind of poverty <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <span class="greek"><a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a></span> which is to be deemed <q>altogether blessed,</q> and any rich man who is to be wholly condemned. For even a common individual would not thus indiscriminately have praised the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, many of whom lead most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> lives. But on this point we have said enough.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>Since Celsus, moreover, from a desire to depreciate the accounts which our Scriptures give of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, has quoted none of them, as if they were unworthy of being recorded by him (or perhaps because he was unacquainted with them), while, on the other hand, he quotes the sayings of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, both from his <em>Epistles</em> and the <em>Ph&aelig;drus</em>, as if these were divinely inspired, but our Scriptures were not, let us set forth a few points, for the sake of comparison with these plausible declarations of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, which did not however, dispose the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> to worship in a manner worthy of him the Maker of all things. For he ought not to have adulterated or polluted this worship with what we call <q><a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>,</q> but what the many would describe by the term <q><a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.</q> Now, according to a Hebrew figure of speech, it is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../bible/psa017.htm">eighteenth Psalm</a>, that <q>He made darkness His secret place,</q>  to signify that those notions which should be worthily entertained of God are invisible and unknowable, because God conceals Himself in darkness, as it were, from those who cannot endure the splendours of His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or are incapable of looking at them, partly owing to the pollution of their understanding, which is clothed with the body of mortal lowliness, and partly owing to its feebler power of comprehending God. And in order that it may appear that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God has rarely been vouchsafed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and has been found in very few individuals, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is related to have entered into the darkness where God was.  And again, with regard to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> it is said: <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> alone shall come near the Lord, but the rest shall not come near.</q>  And again, that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> may show the depth of the doctrines which relate to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which is unattainable by those who do not possess the <q>Spirit which searches all things, even the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he added: <q>The abyss like a garment is His covering.</q>  Nay, our Lord and Saviour, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, manifesting that the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father is appropriately comprehended and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> pre-eminently by Him alone, and in the second place by those whose minds are enlightened by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> Himself and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, declares: <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the Father; neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> any man the Father but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.</q>  For no one can worthily <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <q>uncreated</q>  and <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of all created nature like the Father who begot Him, nor any one the Father like the living <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, and His Wisdom and Truth.  By sharing in Him who takes away from the Father what is called <q>darkness,</q> which He <q>made His secret place,</q> and <q>the abyss,</q> which is called His <q>covering,</q> and in this way unveiling the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, every one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father who  is capable of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p>I thought it right to quote these few instances from a much larger number of passages, in which our sacred writers express their ideas regarding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order to show that, to those who have eyes to behold the venerable character of Scripture, the sacred writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> contain things more worthy of reverence than those sayings of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> which Celsus admires. Now the declaration of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, quoted by Celsus, runs as follows: <q>All things are around the King of all, and all things exist for his sake, and he is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. With things of the second rank he is second, and with those of the third rank he is third. The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, accordingly, is eager to learn what these things are, looking to such things as are kindred to itself, none of which is perfect. But as regards the King and those things which I mentioned, there is nothing which resembles them.</q>  I might have mentioned, moreover, what is said of those beings which are called seraphim by the Hebrews, and described in Isaiah,  who cover the face and feet of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of those called <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, whom Ezekiel  has described, and the postures of these, and of the manner in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be borne upon the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>. But since they are mentioned in a very <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> manner, on account of the unworthy and the indecent, who are unable to enter into the great thoughts and venerable nature of theology, I have not deemed it becoming to discourse of them in this treatise.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p>Celsus in the next place alleges, that <q>certain <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, having misunderstood the words of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, loudly boast of a 'super-celestial' <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thus ascending beyond the heaven of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</q> By these words, indeed, he does not make it clear whether they also ascend beyond the <em>God</em> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or only beyond the heaven by which they <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>. It is not our purpose at present, however, to speak of those who acknowledge another god than the one worshipped by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but to defend ourselves, and to show that it was impossible for the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whose writings are reckoned among ours, to have borrowed anything from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, because they were older than he. They did not then borrow from him the declaration, that <q>all things are around the King of all, and that all exist on account of him;</q> for we have learned that nobler thoughts than these have been uttered by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, by Jesus Himself and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who have clearly indicated the meaning of the spirit that was in them, which was none other than the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Nor was the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> the first to present to view the <q>super-celestial</q> place; for David long ago brought to view the profundity and multitude of the thoughts concerning God entertained by those who have ascended above visible things, when he said in the book of Psalms: <q>Praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you heaven of heavens and you waters that be above the heavens, let them praise the name of the Lord .</q>  I do not, indeed, deny that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> learned from certain Hebrews the words quoted from the <em>Ph&aelig;drus</em>, or even, as some have recorded, that he quoted them from a perusal of our prophetic writings, when he said: <q>No poet here below has ever sung of the super-celestial place, or ever will sing in a becoming manner,</q> and so on. And in the same passage is the following: <q>For the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which is both colourless and formless, and which cannot be touched, which really exists, is the pilot of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and is beheld by the understanding alone; and around it the genus of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> holds this place.</q>  Our <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, moreover, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by these words, and longing after things <q>supra-mundane</q> and <q>super-celestial,</q> and doing his utmost for their sake to attain them, says in the second Epistle to the Corinthians: <q>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> weight of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are unseen are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p>Now, to those who are capable of understanding him, the apostle manifestly presents to view <q>things which are the objects of perception,</q> calling them <q>things seen;</q> while he terms <q>unseen,</q> things which are the object of the understanding, and cognisable by it alone. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, also, that things <q>seen</q> and visible are <q>temporal,</q> but that things cognisable by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and <q>not seen,</q> are <q><a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>;</q> and desiring to remain in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of these, and being assisted by his earnest longing for them, he deemed all affliction as <q>light</q> and as <q>nothing,</q> and during the season of afflictions and troubles was not at all bowed down by them, but by his <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of (divine) things deemed every calamity a light thing, seeing we also have <q>a great High Priest,</q> who by the greatness of His power and understanding <q>has passed through the heavens, even Jesus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> who has promised to all that have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> learned divine things, and have lived lives in harmony with them, to go before them to the things that are supra-mundane; for His words are: <q>That where I go, you may be also.</q>  And therefore we hope, after the troubles and struggles which we suffer here, to reach the highest heavens,  and receiving, agreeably to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the fountains of water that spring up unto <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and being filled with the rivers of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,  shall be united with those waters that are said to be above the heavens, and which praise His name. And as many of us  as praise Him shall not be carried about by the revolution of the heaven, but shall be ever engaged in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which are no longer understood by us through the things which He has made from the creation of the world, but seeing, as it was expressed by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in these words, <q>then face to face;</q>  and in these, <q>When that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p>The Scriptures which are current in the Churches  of God do not speak of <q>seven</q> heavens, or of any definite number at all,  but they do appear to teach the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <q>heavens,</q> whether that means the <q>spheres</q> of those bodies which the Greeks call <q>planets,</q> or something more <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a>. Celsus, too, agreeably to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>,  asserts that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> can make their way to and from the earth through the planets; while <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, our most ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, says that a divine vision was presented to the view of our <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jacob, &mdash; a ladder stretching to heaven, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God ascending and descending upon it, and the Lord supported  upon its top&mdash;obscurely pointing, by this matter of the ladder, either to the same truths which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> had in view, or to something greater than these. On this subject <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> has composed a treatise which deserves the thoughtful and intelligent investigation of all lovers of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p>After this, Celsus, desiring to exhibit his learning in his treatise against us, quotes also certain Persian <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, where he says: <q>These things are obscurely hinted at in the accounts of the Persians, and especially in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a>, which are celebrated among them. For in the latter there is a representation of the two heavenly revolutions&mdash;of the movement, viz., of the fixed  stars, and of that which take place among the planets, and of the passage of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through these. The representation is of the following nature: There is a ladder with lofty gates,  and on the top of it an eighth gate. The first gate consists of lead, the second of tin, the third of copper, the fourth of iron, the fifth of a mixture of metals,  the sixth of silver, and the seventh of gold. The first gate they assign to Saturn, indicating by the 'lead' the slowness of this star; the second to Venus, comparing her to the splendour and softness of tin; the third to Jupiter, being firm  and solid; the fourth to Mercury, for both Mercury and iron are fit to endure all things, and are money-making and laborious;  the fifth to Mars, because, being composed of a mixture of metals, it is varied and unequal; the sixth, of silver, to the Moon; the seventh, of gold, to the Sun&mdash;thus imitating the different colours of the two latter.</q> He next proceeds to examine the reason of the stars being arranged in this order, which is symbolized by the names of the rest of matter.  Musical reasons, moreover, are added or quoted by the Persian theology; and to these, again, he strives to add a second explanation, connected also with musical considerations. But it seems to me, that to quote the language of Celsus upon these matters would be absurd, and similar to what he himself has done, when, in his accusations against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he quoted, most inappropriately, not only the words of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>; but, dissatisfied even with these,  he adduced in addition the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Persian <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a>, and the explanation of them. Now, whatever be the case with regard to these&mdash;whether the Persians and those who conduct the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a> give false or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> accounts regarding them&mdash;why did he select these for quotation, rather than some of the other <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, with the explanation of them? For the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a> do not appear to be more famous among the Greeks than those of Eleusis, or than those in &AElig;gina, where individuals are initiated in the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of Hecate. But if he must introduce barbarian <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> with their explanation, why not rather those of the Egyptians, which are highly regarded by many,  or those of the Cappadocians regarding the Comanian Diana, or those of the Thracians, or even those of the Romans themselves, who initiate the noblest members of their senate?  But if he deemed it inappropriate to institute a comparison with any of these, because they furnished no aid in the way of accusing <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, why did it not also appear to him inappropriate to adduce the instance of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p>If one wished to obtain means for a profounder <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the entrance of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> into divine things, not from the statements of that very insignificant <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> from which he quoted, but from books&mdash; partly those of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, which are read in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, and adopted by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and partly from those of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> alone&mdash; let him peruse, at the end of Ezekiel's prophecies, the visions beheld by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, in which gates of different kinds are enumerated,  which obscurely refer to the different modes in which divine <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> enter into a better world;  and let him peruse also, from the Apocalypse of John, what is related of the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the heavenly Jerusalem, and of its foundations and gates.  And if he is capable of finding out also the road, which is indicated by <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>, of those who will march on to divine things, let him read the book of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> entitled Numbers, and let him seek the help of one who is capable of initiating him into the meaning of the narratives concerning the encampments of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; viz., of what sort those were which were arranged towards the east, as was the case with the first; and what those towards the south-west and south; and what towards the sea; and what the last were, which were stationed towards the north. For he will see that there is in the respective places a meaning  not to be lightly treated, nor, as Celsus imagines, such as calls only for silly and servile listeners: but he will distinguish in the encampments certain things relating to the numbers that are enumerated, and which are specially adapted to each tribe, of which the present does not appear to us to be the proper time to speak. Let Celsus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, moreover, as well as those who read his book, that in no part of the genuine and divinely accredited Scriptures are <q>seven</q> heavens mentioned; neither do our <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself, repeat anything which they borrowed from the Persians or the Cabiri.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p>After the instance borrowed from the <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithraic</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, Celsus declares that he who would investigate the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, along with the aforesaid Persian, will, on comparing the two together, and on unveiling the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, see in this way the difference between them. Now, wherever he was able to give the names of the various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, he was nothing loth to quote those with which he thought himself acquainted; but when he ought most of all to have done this, if they were really <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him, and to have informed us which was the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> that makes use of the diagram he has drawn, he has not done so. It seems to me, however, that it is from some statements of a very insignificant <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> called Ophites,  which he has misunderstood, that, in my opinion, he has partly borrowed what he says about the diagram.  Now, as we have always been animated by a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of learning,  we have fallen in with this diagram, and we have found in it the representations of men who, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>creep into houses, and lead captive silly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> laden with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, led away with various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>; ever learning, and never able to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  The diagram was, however, so destitute of all credibility, that neither these easily deceived <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, nor the most rustic class of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, nor those who were ready to be led away by any plausible pretender whatever, ever gave their assent to the diagram. Nor, indeed, have we ever met any individual, although we have visited many parts of the earth, and have sought out all those who anywhere made profession of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that placed any <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in this diagram.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p>In this diagram were described ten circles, distinct from each other, but united by one circle, which was said to be the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of all things, and was called <q>Leviathan.</q>  This Leviathan, the Jewish Scriptures say, whatever they mean by the expression, was created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for a plaything;  for we find in the Psalms: <q>In wisdom have You made all things: the earth is full of Your creatures; so is this great and wide sea. There go the ships; small animals with great; there is this dragon, which You have formed to play therein.</q>  Instead of the word <q>dragon,</q> the term <q>leviathan</q> is in the Hebrew. This impious diagram, then, said of this leviathan, which is so clearly depreciated by the Psalmist, that it was the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which had travelled through all things! We observed, also, in the diagram, the being named <q>Behemoth,</q> placed as it were under the lowest circle. The inventor of this accursed diagram had inscribed this leviathan at its circumference and centre, thus placing its name in two separate places. Moreover, Celsus says that the diagram was <q>divided by a thick black line, and this line he asserted was called Gehenna, which is Tartarus.</q> Now as we found that Gehenna was mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> as a place of punishment, we searched to see whether it is mentioned anywhere in the ancient Scriptures, and especially because the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> too use the word. And we ascertained that where the valley of the son of Ennom was named in Scripture in the Hebrew, instead of <q>valley,</q> with fundamentally the same meaning, it was termed both the valley of Ennom and also Geenna. And continuing our researches, we find that what was termed <q>Geenna,</q> or <q>the valley of Ennom,</q> was included in the lot of the tribe of Benjamin, in which Jerusalem also was situated. And seeking to ascertain what might be the inference from the heavenly Jerusalem belonging to the lot of Benjamin and the valley of Ennom, we find a certain confirmation of what is said regarding the place of punishment, intended for the purification of such <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> as are to be purified by torments, agreeably to the saying: <q>The Lord comes like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: and He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and of gold.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p>It is in the precincts of Jerusalem, then, that punishments will be inflicted upon those who undergo the process of purification,  who have received into the substance of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the elements of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, which in a certain place  is figuratively termed <q>lead,</q> and on that account iniquity is represented in Zechariah as sitting upon a <q>talent of lead.</q>  But the remarks which might be made on this topic are neither to be made to all, nor to be uttered on the present occasion; for it is not unattended with danger to commit to writing the explanation of such subjects, seeing the multitude need no further instruction than that which relates to the punishment of sinners; while to ascend beyond this is not expedient, for the sake of those who are with difficulty restrained, even by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, from plunging into any degree of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and into the flood of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which result from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.  The doctrine of Geenna, then, is unknown both to the diagram and to Celsus: for had it been otherwise, the framers of the former would not have boasted of their pictures of animals and diagrams, as if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were represented by these; nor would Celsus, in his treatise against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, have introduced among the charges directed against them statements which they never uttered instead of what was spoken by some who perhaps are no longer in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but have altogether disappeared, or been reduced to a very few individuals, and these easily counted. And as it does not beseem those who profess the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> to offer a defence of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> and his impious opinions, so neither is it for us to defend the diagram, or to refute the accusations brought against it by Celsus. We may therefore allow his charges on these points to pass as superfluous and useless,  for we would censure more severely than Celsus any who should be carried away by such opinions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

<p>After the matter of the diagram, he brings forward certain monstrous statements, in the form of question and answer,  regarding what is called by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers the <q>seal,</q> statements which did not arise from imperfect information; such as that <q>he who impresses the seal is called father, and he who is sealed is called young man and son;</q> and who answers, <q>I have been anointed with white ointment from the tree of life,</q>&mdash; things which we never heard to have occurred even among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. In the next place, he determines even the number mentioned by those who deliver over the seal, as that <q>of seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who attach themselves to both sides of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the dying body; the one party being named <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of light, the others 'archontics;'</q>  and he asserts that the <q>ruler of those named 'archontics' is termed the 'accursed' god.</q> Then, laying hold of the expression, he assails, not without reason, those who venture to use such language; and on that account we entertain a similar feeling of indignation with those who censure such individuals, if indeed there exist any who call the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>&mdash; who sends rain and thunder, and who is the Creator of this world, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and of the cosmogony which he records&mdash; an <q>accursed</q> divinity. Celsus, however, appears to have had in view in employing these expressions, not a <em>rational</em>  object, but one of a most irrational kind, arising out of his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> towards us, which is so unlike a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. For his aim was, that those who are unacquainted with our customs should, on perusing his treatise, at once assail us as if we called the noble Creator of this world an <q>accursed divinity.</q> He appears to me, indeed, to have acted like those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who, when <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> began to be first preached, scattered abroad false reports of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, such as that <q><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> offered up an infant in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and partook of its flesh;</q> and again, <q>that the professors of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, wishing to do the 'works of darkness,' used to extinguish the lights (in their meetings), and each one to have sexual intercourse with any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom he chanced to meet.</q> These <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> have long exercised, although unreasonably, an influence over the minds of very many, leading those who are aliens to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are men of such a character; and even at the present day they mislead some, and prevent them from entering even into the simple intercourse of conversation with those who are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<p>With some such object as this in view does Celsus seem to have been actuated, when he alleged that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> term the Creator an <q>accursed divinity;</q> in order that he who believes these charges of his against us, should, if possible, arise and exterminate the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as the most impious of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Confusing, moreover, things that are distinct,  he states also the reason why the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the Mosaic cosmogony is termed <q>accursed,</q> asserting that <q>such is his character, and worthy of execration in the opinion of those who so regard him, inasmuch as he pronounced a curse upon the serpent, who introduced the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> Now he ought to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that those who have espoused the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the serpent, because he gave good advice to the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, and who go far beyond the Titans and Giants of fable, and are on this account called Ophites, are so far from being <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that they bring accusations against Jesus to as great a degree as Celsus himself; and they do not admit any one into their assembly  until he has uttered maledictions against Jesus. See, then, how irrational is the procedure of Celsus, who, in his discourse against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, represents as such those who will not even listen to the <em>name</em> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, or omit even that He was a wise man, or a person of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>  character! What, then, could evince greater folly or <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, not only on the part of those who wish to derive their name from the serpent as the author of good,  but also on the part of Celsus, who thinks that the accusations with which the Ophites  are charged, are chargeable also against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>! Long ago, indeed, that Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> who preferred a state of poverty,  and who exhibited the pattern of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life, showing that he was not excluded from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> although he was possessed of nothing,  termed himself a Cynic; while these impious wretches, as not being <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, whose enemy the serpent is, but as being serpents, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves upon being called Ophites from the serpent, which is an animal most hostile to and greatly dreaded by man, and boast of one Euphrates  as the introducer of these unhallowed opinions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>

<p>In the next place, as if it were the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> whom he was <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniating</a>, he continues his accusations against those who termed the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and of his law an <q>accursed</q> divinity; and imagining that it is the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who so speak, he expresses himself thus: <q>What could be more foolish or insane than such senseless  wisdom? For what blunder has the Jewish lawgiver committed? And why do you accept, by means, as you say,  of a certain allegorical and typical method of interpretation, the cosmogony which he gives, and the law of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, while it is with unwillingness, O most impious man, that you give praise to the Creator of the world, who promised to give them all things; who promised to multiply their race to the ends of the earth, and to raise them up from the dead with the same flesh and blood, and who gave inspiration  to their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and, again, you <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> Him! When you feel the force of such considerations, indeed, you acknowledge that you worship the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but when your teacher Jesus and the Jewish <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> give contradictory decisions,  you seek another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, instead of Him, and the Father!</q> Now, by such statements, this illustrious <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Celsus distinctly <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, asserting that, when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> press them hard, they acknowledge the same God as they do; but that when Jesus legislates differently from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, they seek another god instead of Him. Now, whether we are conversing with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or are alone with ourselves, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of only one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also worshipped of old time, and still profess to worship as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we are guilty of no impiety towards Him. We do <em>not</em> assert, however, that God will raise men from the dead with the same flesh and blood, as has been shown in the preceding pages; for we do not maintain that the natural  body, which is sown in corruption, and in dishonour, and in weakness, will rise again such as it was sown. On such subjects, however, we have spoken at adequate length in the foregoing pages.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>

<p>He next returns to the subject of the Seven ruling Demons,  whose names are not found among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but who, I think, are accepted by the Ophites. We found, indeed, that in the diagram, which on their account we procured a sight of, the same order was laid down as that which Celsus has given. Celsus says that <q>the goat was shaped like a lion,</q> not mentioning the name given him by those who are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the most impious of individuals; whereas <em>we</em> discovered that He who is honoured in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Creator is called by this accursed diagram Michael the Lion-like. Again, Celsus says that the <q>second in order is a bull;</q> whereas the diagram which we possessed made him to be Suriel, the bull-like. Further, Celsus termed the third <q>an amphibious sort of animal, and one that hissed frightfully;</q> while the diagram described the third as Raphael, the serpent-like. Moreover, Celsus asserted that the <q>fourth had the form of an eagle;</q> the diagram representing him as Gabriel, the eagle-like. Again, the <q>fifth,</q> according to Celsus, <q>had the countenance of a bear;</q> and this, according to the diagram, was Thauthabaoth,  the bear-like. Celsus continues his account, that the <q>sixth was described as having the face of a dog;</q> and him the diagram called Erataoth. The <q>seventh,</q> he adds, <q>had the countenance of an ass, and was named Thaphabaoth or Onoel;</q> whereas we discovered that in the diagram he is called Onoel, or Thartharaoth, being somewhat asinine in appearance. We have thought it proper to be exact in stating these matters, that we might not appear to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of those things which Celsus professed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but that we <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> them better than he, may demonstrate that these are not the words of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but of those who are altogether alienated from <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and who neither acknowledge Jesus as Saviour, nor <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor Teacher, nor <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>

<p>Moreover, if any one would wish to become acquainted with the artifices of those sorcerers, through which they desire to lead men away by their teaching (as if they possessed the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of certain secret <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>), but are not at all successful in so doing, let him listen to the instruction which they receive after passing through what is termed the <q>fence of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>,</q> &mdash; gates which are subjected to the world of ruling spirits.  (The following, then, is the manner in which they proceed): <q>I salute the one-formed  king, the bond of blindness, complete  oblivion, the first power, preserved by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and by wisdom, from whom I am sent forth pure, being already part of the light of the son and of the father: <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be with me; yea, O father, let it be with me.</q> They say also that the beginnings of the Ogdoad  are derived from this. In the next place, they are taught to say as follows, while passing through what they call Ialdabaoth: <q>You, O first and seventh, who art born to command with confidence, you, O Ialdabaoth, who art the rational ruler of a pure <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and a perfect work to son and father, bearing the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of life in the character of a type, and opening to the world the gate which you closed against your kingdom, I pass again in freedom through your realm. Let <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be with me; yea, O father, let it be with me.</q> They say, moreover, that the star Ph&aelig;non  is in sympathy  with the lion-like ruler. They next <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that he who has passed through Ialdabaoth and arrived at Iao ought thus to speak: <q>You, O second Iao, who shinest by night,  who art the ruler of the secret <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of son and father, first prince of death, and portion of the innocent, bearing now my own beard as <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>, I am ready to pass through your realm, having strengthened him who is born of you by the living word. Grace be with me; father, let it be with me.</q> They next come to Sabaoth, to whom they think the following should be addressed: <q>O governor of the fifth realm, powerful Sabaoth, defender of the law of your creatures, who are liberated by your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through the help of a more powerful Pentad,  admit me, seeing the faultless <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of their art, preserved by the stamp of an image, a body liberated by a Pentad. Let <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be with me, O father, let <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be with me.</q> And after Sabaoth they come to Astaph&aelig;us, to whom they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the following <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should be offered: <q>O Astaph&aelig;us, ruler of the third gate, overseer of the first principle of water, look upon me as one of your initiated,  admit me who am purified with the spirit of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, you who sees the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the world. Let <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be with me, O father, let <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be with me.</q> After him comes Alo&aelig;us, who is to be thus addressed: <q>O Alo&aelig;us, governor of the second gate, let me pass, seeing I bring to you the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of your mother, a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is hidden by the powers of the realms.  Let <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be with me, O father, let it be with me.</q> And last of all they name Hor&aelig;us, and think that the following <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> ought to be offered to him: <q>You who fearlessly leaped over the rampart of fire, O Hor&aelig;us, who obtained the government of the first gate, let me pass, seeing you behold the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of your own power, sculptured  on the figure of the tree of life, and formed after this image, in the likeness of innocence. Let <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be with me, O father, let <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be with me.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>

<p>The supposed great learning of Celsus, which is composed, however, rather of curious trifles and silly talk than anything else, has made us touch upon these topics, from a wish to show to every one who peruses his treatise and our reply, that we have no lack of information on those subjects, from which he takes occasion to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who neither are acquainted with, nor concern themselves about, such matters.  For we, too, desired both to learn and set forth these things, in order that sorcerers might not, under pretext of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> more than we, delude those who are easily carried away by the glitter  of names. And I could have given many more illustrations to show that we are acquainted with the opinions of these deluders,  and that we disown them, as being alien to ours, and impious, and not in harmony with the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, of which we are ready to make confession even to the death. It must be noticed, too, that those who have drawn up this array of fictions, have, from neither understanding magic, nor discriminating the meaning of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, thrown everything into confusion; seeing that they have borrowed from magic the names of Ialdabaoth, and Astaph&aelig;us, and Hor&aelig;us, and from the Hebrew Scriptures him who is termed in Hebrew Iao or Jah, and Sabaoth, and Adon&aelig;us, and Elo&aelig;us. Now the names taken from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are names of one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which, not being understood by the enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as even themselves acknowledge, led to their imagining that Iao was a different <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Sabaoth another, and Adon&aelig;us, whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> term Adonai, a third besides, and that Elo&aelig;us, whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> name in Hebrew Eloi, was also different</p>

<h2>Chapter 33</h2>

<p>Celsus next relates other fables, to the effect that <q>certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> return to the shapes of the archontics,  so that some are called lions, others bulls, others dragons, or eagles, or bears, or dogs.</q> We found also in the diagram which we possessed, and which Celsus called the <q>square pattern,</q> the statements  made by these unhappy beings concerning the gates of Paradise. The flaming sword was depicted as the diameter of a flaming circle, and as if mounting guard over the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of life. Celsus, however, either would not or could not repeat the harangues which, according to the fables of these impious individuals, are represented as spoken at each of the gates by those who pass through them; but this we have done in order to show to Celsus and those who read his treatise, that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the depth of these unhallowed <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>,  and that they are far removed from the worship which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> offer up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>

<p>After finishing the foregoing, and those analogous matters which we ourselves have added, Celsus continues as follows: <q>They continue to heap together one thing after another&mdash;discourses of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and circles upon circles, and effluents  from an earthly church, and from <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; and a power flowing from one Prunicos, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and a living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and a heaven slain in order to live, and an earth slaughtered by the sword, and many <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> that they may live, and death ceasing in the world, when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world is dead; and, again, a narrow way, and gates that open spontaneously. And in all their writings (is mention made) of the tree of life, and a resurrection of the flesh by means  of the 'tree,' because, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, their teacher was nailed to a cross, and was a carpenter by craft; so that if he had chanced to have been cast from a precipice, or thrust into a pit, or suffocated by hanging, or had been a leather-cutter, or stone-cutter, or worker in iron, there would have been (invented) a precipice of life beyond the heavens, or a pit of resurrection, or a cord of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, or a blessed stone, or an iron of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, or a sacred leather! Now what old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> would not be ashamed to utter such things in a whisper, even when making stories to lull an infant to sleep?</q> In using such language as this, Celsus appears to me to confuse together matters which he has imperfectly heard. For it seems likely that, even supposing that he had heard a few words traceable to some existing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, he did not clearly understand the meaning intended to be conveyed; but heaping the words together, he wished to show before those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing either of our opinions or of those of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that he was acquainted with all the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. And this is evident also from the foregoing words.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35</h2>

<p>It is our practice, indeed, to make use of the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who demonstrate that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ predicted by them, and who show from the prophetic writings the events in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> regarding Jesus have been fulfilled. But when Celsus speaks of <q>circles upon circles,</q> (he perhaps borrowed the expression) from the aforementioned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which includes in one circle (which they call the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of all things, and Leviathan) the seven circles of archontic <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or perhaps it arises from misunderstanding the preacher, when he says: <q>The wind goes in a circle of circles, and returns again upon its circles.</q>  The expression, too, <q>effluents of an earthly church and of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>,</q> was probably taken from the fact that the church on earth was called by some an effluent  from a heavenly church and a better world; and that the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> described in the law was a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> performed there, in a certain place set apart for purification. The adherents of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, moreover, in keeping with their system of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>,  give the name of Prunicos to a certain kind of wisdom, of which they would have the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> afflicted with the twelve years' issue of blood to be the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>; so that Celsus, who confuses together all sorts of opinions&mdash; Greek, Barbarian, and Heretical&mdash; having heard of her, asserted that it was a power flowing forth from one Prunicos, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. The <q>living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,</q> again, is perhaps mysteriously referred by some of the followers of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> to the being whom they term the psychic  creator of the world; or perhaps, in contradistinction to a <q>dead</q> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <q>living</q> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is termed by some, not inelegantly,  the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <q>him who is saved.</q> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing, however, of a <q>heaven which is said to be slain,</q> or of an <q>earth slaughtered by the sword,</q> or of many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> slain in order that they might live; for it is not unlikely that these were coined by Celsus out of his own brain.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36</h2>

<p>We would say, moreover, that death ceases in the world when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world dies, referring the saying to the mystical words of the apostle, which run as follows: <q>When He shall have put all enemies under His feet, then the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</q>  And also: <q>When this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</q>  The <q>strait descent,</q>  again, may perhaps be referred by those who hold the doctrine of transmigration of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to that view of things. And it is not incredible that the gates which are said to open spontaneously are referred obscurely by some to the words, <q>Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may go into them, and praise the Lord; this gate of the Lord, into it the righteous shall enter;</q>  and again, to what is said in the ninth psalm, <q>You that liftest me up from the gates of death, that I may show forth all Your praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion.</q>  The Scripture further gives the name of <q>gates of death</q> to those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which lead to destruction, as it terms, on the contrary, good actions the <q>gates of Zion.</q> So also <q>the gates of righteousness,</q> which is an equivalent expression to <q>the gates of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>,</q> and these are ready to be opened to him who follows after <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> pursuits. The subject of the <q>tree of life</q> will be more appropriately explained when we interpret the statements in the book of Genesis regarding the paradise planted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Celsus, moreover, has often mocked at the subject of a resurrection,&mdash; a doctrine which he did not comprehend; and on the present occasion, not satisfied with what he has formerly said, he adds, <q>And there is said to be a resurrection of the flesh by means of the tree;</q> not understanding, I think, the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> expression, that <q>through the tree came death, and through the tree comes life,</q>  because death was in Adam, and life in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He next scoffs at the <q>tree,</q> assailing it on two grounds, and saying, <q>For this reason is the tree introduced, either because our teacher was nailed to a cross, or because he was a carpenter by trade;</q> not observing that the tree of life is mentioned in the Mosaic writings, and being blind also to this, that in none of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> current in the Churches  is Jesus Himself ever described as being a carpenter. </p>

<h2>Chapter 37</h2>

<p>Celsus, moreover, thinks that we have invented this <q>tree of life</q> to give an allegorical meaning to the cross; and in consequence of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> upon this point, he adds: <q>If he had happened to be cast down a precipice, or shoved into a pit, or suffocated by hanging, there would have been invented a precipice of life far beyond the heavens, or a pit of resurrection, or a cord of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</q> And again: <q>If the 'tree of life' were an invention, because he&mdash; Jesus&mdash; (is reported) to have been a carpenter, it would follow that if he had been a leather-cutter, something would have been said about <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> leather; or had he been a stone-cutter, about a blessed stone; or if a worker in iron, about an iron of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> Now, who does not see at once  the paltry nature of his charge, in thus <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniating</a> men whom he professed to convert on the ground of their being deceived? And after these remarks, he goes on to speak in a way quite in harmony with the tone of those who have invented the fictions of lion-like, and ass-headed, and serpent-like ruling <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,  and other similar absurdities, but which does not affect those who belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, even a drunken old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> would be ashamed to chaunt or whisper to an infant, in order to lull him to sleep, any such fables as those have done who invented the beings with asses' heads, and the harangues, so to speak, which are delivered at each of the gates. But Celsus is not acquainted with the doctrines of the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which very few have been able to comprehend, even of those who have devoted all their lives, in conformity with the command of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, to the searching of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and have laboured to investigate the meaning of the sacred books, to a greater degree than Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> in their efforts to attain a so-called wisdom.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38</h2>

<p>Our noble (friend), moreover, not satisfied with the objections which he has drawn from the diagram, desires, in order to strengthen his accusations against us, who have nothing in common with it, to introduce certain other charges, which he adduces from the same (<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>), but yet as if they were from a different source. His words are: <q>And that is not the least of their marvels, for there are between the upper circles&mdash; those that are above the heavens&mdash; certain inscriptions of which they give the interpretation, and among others two words especially, 'a greater and a less,' which they refer to Father and Son.</q>  Now, in the diagram referred to, we found the greater and the lesser circle, upon the diameter of which was inscribed <q>Father and Son;</q> and between the greater circle (in which the lesser was contained) and another  composed of two circles&mdash;the outer one of which was yellow, and the inner blue&mdash;a barrier inscribed in the shape of a hatchet. And above it, a short circle, close to the greater of the two former, having the inscription <q>Love;</q> and lower down, one touching the same circle, with the word <q>Life.</q> And on the second circle, which was intertwined with and included two other circles, another figure, like a rhomboid, (entitled) <q>The foresight of wisdom.</q> And within their point of common section was <q>The nature of wisdom.</q> And above their point of common section was a circle, on which was inscribed <q>Knowledge;</q> and lower down another, on which was the inscription, <q>Understanding.</q> We have introduced these matters into our reply to Celsus, to show to our readers that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> better than he, and not by mere report, those things, even although we also disapprove of them. Moreover, if those who <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves upon such matters profess also a kind of magic and sorcery,&mdash; which, in their opinion, is the summit of wisdom&mdash;we, on the other hand, make no affirmation about it, seeing we never have discovered anything of the kind. Let Celsus, however, who has been already often convicted of false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and irrational accusations, see whether he is not guilty of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> in these also, or whether he has not extracted and introduced into his treatise, statements taken from the writings of those who are foreigners and strangers to our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39</h2>

<p>In the next place, speaking of those who employ the arts of magic and sorcery, and who invoke the barbarous names of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, he remarks that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> act like those who, in reference to the same things,  perform marvels before those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the names of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> among the Greeks are different from what they are among the Scythians. He then quotes a passage from Herodotus, stating that <q>Apollo is called Gongosyrus by the Scythians; Poseidon, Thagimasada; Aphrodite, Argimpasan; Hestia, Tabiti.</q>  Now, he who has the capacity can inquire whether in these matters Celsus and Herodotus are not both wrong; for the Scythians do not understand the same thing as the Greeks, in what relates to those beings which are deemed to be gods. For how is it credible  that Apollo should be called Gongosyrus by the Scythians? I do not suppose that Gongosyrus, when transferred into the Greek language, yields the same etymology as Apollo; or that Apollo, in the dialect of the Scythians, has the signification of Gongosyrus. Nor has any such assertion hitherto been made regarding the other names,  for the Greeks took occasion from different circumstances and etymologies to give to those who are by them deemed gods the names which they bear; and the Scythians, again, from another set of circumstances; and the same also was the case with the Persians, or Indians, or <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>, or Libyans, or with those who delight to bestow names (from fancy), and who do not abide by the just and pure idea of the Creator of all things. Enough, however, has been said by us in the preceding pages, where we wished to demonstrate that Sabaoth and Zeus were not the same deity, and where also we made some remarks, derived from the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, regarding the different dialects. We willingly, then, pass by these points, on which Celsus would make us repeat ourselves. In the next place, again, mixing up together matters which belong to magic and sorcery, and referring them perhaps to no one&mdash;because of the non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of any who practise magic under pretence of a worship of this character,&mdash; and yet, perhaps, having in view some who <em>do</em> employ such practices in the presence of the simple (that they may have the appearance of acting by divine power), he adds: <q>What need to number up all those who have taught methods of purification, or expiatory <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, or spells for averting <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or (the making of) images, or resemblances of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or the various sorts of antidotes against poison (to be found)  in clothes, or in numbers, or stones, or plants, or roots, or generally in all kinds of things?</q> In respect to these matters, reason does not require us to offer any defence, since we are not liable in the slightest degree to suspicions of such a nature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40</h2>

<p>After these things, Celsus appears to me to act like those who, in their intense <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, maintain, in the presence of those who are utterly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that they have actually ascertained that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> devour the flesh of infants, and give themselves without restraint to sexual intercourse with their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Now, as these statements have been condemned as falsehoods invented against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and this admission made by the multitude and those altogether aliens to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; so would the following statements of Celsus be found to be <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> invented against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, where he says that <q>he has seen in the hands of certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> belonging to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>  barbarous books, containing the names and marvellous doings of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>;</q> asserting further, that <q>these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> professed to do no good, but all that was calculated to injure <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings.</q> Would, indeed, that all that is said by Celsus against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was of such a nature as to be refuted by the multitude, who have ascertained by experience that such things are untrue, seeing that most of them have lived as neighbours with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and have not even heard of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of any such alleged practices!</p>

<h2>Chapter 41</h2>

<p>In the next place, as if he had forgotten that it was his object to write against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, he says that, <q>having become acquainted with one Dionysius, an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> musician, the latter told him, with respect to magic arts, that it was only over the uneducated and men of corrupt morals that they had any power, while on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> they were unable to produce any effect, because they were careful to observe a healthy manner of life.</q> If, now, it had been our purpose to treat of magic, we could have added a few remarks in addition to what we have already said on this topic; but since it is only the more important matters which we have to notice in answer to Celsus, we shall say of magic, that any one who chooses to inquire whether <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were ever led captive by it or not, can read what has been written by Moiragenes regarding the memoirs of the magician and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Apollonius of Tyana, in which this individual, who is not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, asserts that some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of no mean note were won over by the magic power possessed by Apollonius, and resorted to him as a sorcerer; and among these, I think, he especially mentioned Euphrates and a certain Epicurean. Now <em>we</em>, on the other hand, affirm, and have learned by experience, that they who worship the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> which comes by Jesus, and who live according to His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, using night and day, continuously and becomingly, the prescribed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, are not carried away either by magic or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For verily <q>the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord encamps round about them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him, and delivers them</q>  from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the little ones in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who are appointed to watch over them, are said always to behold the face of their Father who is in heaven,  whatever be the meaning of <q>face</q> or of <q>behold.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 42</h2>

<p>After these matters, Celsus brings the following charges against us from another quarter: <q>Certain most impious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>,</q> he says, <q>are committed by them, due to their extreme <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, in which they have wandered away from the meaning of the divine enigmas, creating an adversary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and naming him in the Hebrew tongue, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. Now, of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, such statements are altogether of mortal invention,  and not even proper to be repeated, viz., that the mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in His desire to confer good upon men, has yet one counterworking Him, and is helpless. The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, it follows, is vanquished by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and being punished by him, teaches us also to despise the punishments which he inflicts, telling us beforehand that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, after appearing to men as He Himself had done, will exhibit great and marvellous works, claiming for himself the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that those who wish to keep him at a distance ought to pay no attention to these works of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, but to place their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him alone. Such statements are manifestly the words of a deluder, planning and man&oelig;uvring against those who are opposed to his views, and who rank themselves against them.</q> In the next place, desiring to point out the <q>enigmas,</q> our mistakes regarding which lead to the introduction of our views concerning <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, he continues: <q>The ancients allude obscurely to a certain <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> among the gods, Heraclitus speaking thus of it: 'If one must say that there is a general <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and discord, and that all things are done and administered in strife.' Pherecydes, again, who is much older than Heraclitus, relates a myth of one army drawn up in hostile array against another, and names Kronos as the leader of the one, and Ophioneus of the other, and recounts their challenges and struggles, and mentions that agreements were entered into between them, to the end that whichever party should fall into the ocean  should be held as vanquished, while those who had expelled and conquered them should have possession of heaven. The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> relating to the Titans and Giants also had some such (<a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a>) meaning, as well as the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Typhon, and Horus, and Osiris.</q> After having made such statements, and not having got over the difficulty  as to the way in which these accounts contain a higher view of things, while our accounts are erroneous copies of them, he continues his abuse of us, remarking that <q>these are not like the stories which are related of a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, or, as he remarks with more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, of a man who is an <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a>, who wishes to establish an opposite doctrine.</q> And in the same way he understands Homer, as if he referred obscurely to matters similar to those mentioned by Heraclitus, and Pherecydes, and the originators of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> about the Titans and Giants, in those words which Heph&aelig;stus addresses to Hera as follows:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p>Once in your <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I felt his matchless might,

<br>Hurled headlong downward from the ethereal height. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>And in those of Zeus to Hera:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p>Have you forgot, when, bound and fix'd on high,

<br>From the vast concave of the spangled sky,

<br>I hung you trembling in a golden chain,

<br>And all the raging gods opposed in vain?

<br>Headlong I hurled them from the Olympian hall,

<br>Stunn'd in the whirl, and breathless with the fall. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>Interpreting, moreover, the words of Homer, he adds: <q>The words of Zeus addressed to Hera are the words of God addressed to matter; and the words addressed to matter obscurely signify that the matter which at the beginning was in a state of discord (with God), was taken by Him, and bound together and arranged under <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, which may be analogically compared to chains;  and that by way of chastising the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who create disorder in it, he hurls them down headlong to this lower world.</q> These words of Homer, he alleges, were so understood by Pherecydes, when he said that beneath that region is the region of Tartarus, which is guarded by the Harpies and Tempest, daughters of Boreas, and to which Zeus banishes any one of the gods who becomes disorderly. With the same ideas also are closely connected the <em>peplos</em> of Athena, which is beheld by all in the procession of the <em>Panathen&aelig;a</em>. For it is manifest from this, he continues, that a motherless and unsullied <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>  has the mastery over the daring of the Giants. While accepting, moreover, the fictions of the Greeks, he continues to heap against us such accusations as the following, viz., that <q>the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is punished by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and teaches us that we also, when punished by him, ought to endure it. Now these statements are altogether ridiculous. For it is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, I think, who ought rather to be punished, and those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings who are <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> by him ought not to be threatened with chastisement.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 43</h2>

<p>Mark now, whether he who charges us with having committed <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the most impious kind, and with having wandered away from the (<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning) of the divine enigmas, is not himself clearly in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, from not observing that in the writings of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, which are much older not merely than Heraclitus and Pherecydes, but even than Homer, mention is made of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one, and of his having fallen from heaven. For the serpent &mdash; from whom the Ophioneus spoken of by Pherecydes is derived&mdash; having become the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> expulsion from the divine Paradise, obscurely shadows forth something similar, having deceived the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>  by a promise of divinity and of greater blessings; and her example is said to have been followed also by the man. And, further, who else could the destroying <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> mentioned in the Exodus of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>  be, than he who was the author of destruction to them that <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> him, and did not withstand his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, nor struggle against them? Moreover (the goat), which in the book of Leviticus  is sent away (into the wilderness), and which in the Hebrew language is named Azazel, was none other than this; and it was necessary to send it away into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and to treat it as an expiatory <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, because on it the lot fell. For all who belong to the <q>worse</q> part, on account of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, being opposed to those who are God's heritage, are deserted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Nay, with respect to the sons of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a> in the book of Judges,  whose sons are they said to be, save his, on account of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? And besides all these instances, in the book of Job, which is older even than <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself,  the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is distinctly described as presenting himself before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and asking for power against Job, that he might involve him in trials  of the most painful kind; the first of which consisted in the loss of all his goods and of his children, and the second in afflicting the whole body of Job with the so-called disease of elephantiasis.  I pass by what might be quoted from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who tempted the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, that I may not appear to quote in reply to Celsus from more recent writings on this question. In the last (chapter)  also of Job, in which the Lord utters to Job amid tempest and clouds what is recorded in the book which bears his name, there are not a few things referring to the serpent. I have not yet mentioned the passages in Ezekiel,  where he speaks, as it were, of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, or the prince of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>; or those in Isaiah,  where lament is made for the king of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, from which not a little might be learned concerning <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its origin and generation, and as to how it derived its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from some who had lost their wings,  and who had followed him who was the first to lose his own.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44</h2>

<p>For it is impossible that the good which is the result of accident, or of communication, should be like that good which comes by nature; and yet the former will never be lost by him who, so to speak, partakes of the <q>living</q> bread with a view to his own preservation. But if it should fail any one, it must be through his own fault, in being <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> to partake of this <q>living bread</q> and <q>genuine drink,</q> by means of which the wings, nourished and watered, are fitted for their purpose, even according to the saying of Solomon, the wisest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> rich man, that <q>he made to himself wings like an eagle, and returns to the house of his patron.</q>  For it became <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to turn to proper account even those who in their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> have <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> from Him, to place <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of this sort in some part of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and to appoint a training-school of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, wherein those must exercise themselves who would desire to recover in a <q>lawful manner</q>  the possession (which they had lost); in order that being tested, like gold in the fire, by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of these, and having exerted themselves to the utmost to prevent anything base injuring their rational nature, they may appear deserving of an ascent to divine things, and may be elevated by the Word to the blessedness which is above all things, and so to speak, to the very summit of goodness. Now he who in the Hebrew language is named <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and by some Satanas&mdash; as being more in conformity with the genius of the Greek language&mdash; signifies, when translated into Greek, <q>adversary.</q> But every one who prefers <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and a vicious life, is (because acting in a manner contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>) Satanas, that is, an <q>adversary</q> to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who is righteousness, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and wisdom.  With more propriety, however, is <em>he</em> called <q>adversary,</q> who was the first among those that were living a peaceful and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life to lose his wings, and to fall from blessedness; he who, according to Ezekiel, walked faultlessly in all his ways, <q>until iniquity was found in him,</q>  and who being the <q>seal of resemblance</q> and the <q>crown of beauty</q> in the paradise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being filled as it were with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, fell into destruction, in accordance with the word which said to him in a mystic sense: <q>You have fallen into destruction, and shall not abide for ever.</q>  We have ventured somewhat rashly to make these few remarks, although in so doing we have added nothing of importance to this treatise. If any one, however, who has leisure for the examination of the sacred writings, should collect together from all sources and form into one body of doctrine what is recorded concerning the origin of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and the manner of its dissolution, he would see that the views of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> regarding <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> had not been even dreamed of either by Celsus or any one of those whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had been dragged down, and torn away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and from right views of Him, and from His word, by this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 45</h2>

<p>But since Celsus rejects the statements concerning <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, as it is termed, having neither read what is said of him in the book of Daniel  nor in the writings of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,  nor what the Saviour in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>  has predicted about his coming, we must make a few remarks upon this subject also; because, <q>as faces do not resemble faces,</q>  so also neither do men's <q>hearts</q> resemble one another. It is certain, then, that there will be diversities among the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash;those which are inclined to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not being all modelled and shaped towards it in the same or like degree; while others, through neglect of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, rush to the opposite extreme. And among the latter are some in whom <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is deeply engrained, and others in whom it is less deeply rooted. Where is the absurdity, then, in holding that there exist among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so to speak, two extremes, &mdash; the one of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and the other of its opposite; so that the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> dwells in the man who realizes the ideal given in Jesus, from whom there flowed to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> so great a conversion, and healing, and amelioration, while the opposite extreme is in the man who embodies the notion of him that is named <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>? For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, comprehending all things by means of His foreknowledge, and foreseeing what consequences would result from both of these, wished to make these <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that those who understand their words might be familiarized with the good, and be on their guard against its opposite. It was proper, moreover, that the one of these extremes, and the best of the two, should be styled the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, on account of His pre-eminence; and the other, who is diametrically opposite, be termed the son of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And, in the next place, since <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is specially characterized by its diffusion, and attains its greatest height when it simulates the appearance of the good, for that reason are signs, and marvels, and lying <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> found to accompany <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, through the co-operation of its father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For, far surpassing the help which these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> give to jugglers (who deceive men for the basest of purposes), is the aid which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself affords in order to deceive the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, indeed, speaks of him who is called <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, describing, though with a certain reserve,  both the manner, and time, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his coming to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. And notice whether his language on this subject is not most becoming, and undeserving of being treated with even the slightest degree of ridicule.</p>

<h2>Chapter 46</h2>

<p>It is thus that the apostle expresses himself: <q>We beseech you, brethren, by the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and by our gathering together unto Him, that you be not soon shaken in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or be troubled, neither by word, nor by spirit, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of the Lord is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means: for <em>that day shall not come</em>, except there come a falling away first, and that man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that is worshipped; so that he sits in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, showing himself that he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Do you not remember that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? And now you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what withholds, that he might be revealed in his time. For the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets <em>will let</em>, until he be taken out of the way. And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: <em>even him</em>, whose coming is after the working of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that they might be saved. And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> God shall send them strong delusion, that they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>; that they all might be damned who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</q>  To explain each particular here referred to does not belong to our present purpose. The <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> also regarding <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> is stated in the book of Daniel, and is fitted to make an intelligent and candid reader admire the words as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine and prophetic; for in them are mentioned the things relating to the coming kingdom, beginning with the times of Daniel, and continuing to the destruction of the world. And any one who chooses may read it. Observe, however, whether the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> regarding <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> be not as follows: <q>And at the latter time of their kingdom, when their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are coming to the full, there shall arise a king, bold in countenance, and understanding riddles. And his power shall be great, and he shall destroy wonderfully, and prosper, and practise; and shall destroy mighty men, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people. And the yoke of his chain shall prosper: there is craft in his hand, and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by craft shall destroy many; and he shall stand up for the destruction of many, and shall crush them as eggs in his hand.</q>  What is stated by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the words quoted from him, where he says, <q>so that he sits in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, showing himself that he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  is in Daniel referred to in the following fashion: <q>And on the temple shall be the abomination of desolations, and at the end of the time an end shall be put to the desolation.</q>  So many, out of a greater number of passages, have I thought it right to adduce, that the hearer may understand in some slight degree the meaning of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, when it gives us information concerning the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>; and being satisfied with what we have quoted for this purpose, let us look at another of the charges of Celsus, and reply to it as we best may.</p>

<h2>Chapter 47</h2>

<p>Celsus, after what has been said, goes on as follows: <q>I can tell how the very thing occurred, viz., that they should call him '<a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.' Men of ancient times termed this world, as being born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both his child and his son.  Both the one and other '<a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,' then, greatly resembled each other.</q> He is therefore of opinion that we employed the expression <q><a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> having perverted  what is said of the world, as being born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and being His <q>Son,</q> and <q>a God.</q> For he was unable so to consider the times of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as to see that the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> predicted generally that there was a <q><a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></q> long before the Greeks and those men of ancient time of whom Celsus speaks. Nay, he would not even quote the passage in the letters of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, to which we referred in the preceding pages, concerning Him who so beautifully arranged this world, as being the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; lest he too should be compelled by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, whom he often mentions with respect, to admit that the architect of this world is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and that His Father is the first God and Sovereign Ruler over all things.  Nor is it at all wonderful if we maintain that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is made one with so great a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> through the highest union with Him, being no longer in a state of separation from Him. For the sacred language of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of other things also, which, although <q>dual</q> in their own nature, are considered to be, and really are, <q>one</q> in respect to one another. It is said of husband and wife, <q>They are no longer two, but one flesh;</q>  and of the perfect man, and of him who is joined to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lord, Word, and Wisdom, and Truth, that <q>he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</q>  And if he who <q>is joined to the Lord is one spirit,</q> who has been joined to the Lord, the Very Word, and Wisdom, and Truth, and Righteousness, in a more intimate union, or even in a manner at all approaching to it than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Jesus? And if this be so, then the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature&mdash; are no longer two, (but one).</p>

<h2>Chapter 48</h2>

<p>In the next place, when the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the Porch, who assert that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the same, maintain that the God who is over all things is not happier than <em>their</em> wise man, but that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of both is equal, Celsus neither ridicules nor scoffs at their opinion. If, however, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that the perfect man is joined to and made one with the Very Word by means of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so that we infer that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is not separated from the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of all creation, he laughs at Jesus being called <q><a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> not observing what is said of Him with a secret and mystical signification in the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>. But that we may win over to the reception of our views those who are willing to accept the inferences which flow from our doctrines, and to be benefited thereby, we say that the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> declare the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, animated by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, to be the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the members of this body&mdash; considered as a whole&mdash; to consist of those who are <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>; since, as a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> vivifies and moves the body, which of itself has not the natural power of motion like a living being, so the Word, arousing and moving the whole body, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to befitting action, awakens, moreover, each individual member belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that they do nothing apart from the Word. Since all this, then, follows by a train of reasoning not to be depreciated, where is the difficulty in maintaining that, as the <em><a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is joined in a perfect and inconceivable manner with the very Word, so the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, generally speaking,  is not separated from the only-begotten and <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of all creation, and is not a different being from Him? But enough here on this subject.</p>

<h2>Chapter 49</h2>

<p>Let us notice now what follows, where, expressing in a single word his opinion regarding the Mosaic cosmogony, without offering, however, a single argument in its support, he finds fault with it, saying: <q>Moreover, their cosmogony is extremely silly.</q>  Now, if he had produced some credible <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of its silly character, we should have endeavoured to answer them; but it does not appear to me reasonable that I should be called upon to demonstrate, in answer to his mere <em>assertion</em>, that it is <em>not</em> <q>silly.</q> If any one, however, wishes to see the reasons which led us to accept the Mosaic account, and the arguments by which it may be defended, he may read what we have written upon Genesis, from the beginning of the book up to the passage, <q>And this is the book of the generation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q>  where we have tried to show from the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> themselves what the <q>heaven</q> was which was created in the beginning; and what the <q>earth,</q> and the <q>invisible part of the earth,</q> and that which was <q>without <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>;</q>  and what the <q>deep</q> was, and the <q>darkness</q> that was upon it; and what the <q>water</q> was, and the <q><a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a></q> which was <q>borne over it;</q> and what the <q>light</q> which was created, and what the <q>firmament,</q> as distinct from the <q>heaven</q> which was created in the beginning; and so on with the other subjects that follow. Celsus has also expressed his opinion that the narrative of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <q>exceedingly silly,</q> without stating any <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, or endeavouring to answer our arguments; for he had no evidence, in my judgment, which was fitted to overthrow the statement that <q>man has been made in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  He does not even understand the meaning of the <q>Paradise</q> that was planted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of the life which man first led in it; and of that which resulted from accident,  when man was cast forth on account of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and was settled opposite the Paradise of delight. Now, as he asserts that these are silly statements, let him turn his attention not merely to each one of them (in general), but to this in particular, <q>He placed the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, and the flaming sword, which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life,</q>  and say whether <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wrote these words with no serious object in view, but in the spirit of the writers of the old Comedy, who have sportively related that <q>Pr&oelig;tus slew Bellerophon,</q> and that <q>Pegasus came from Arcadia.</q> Now their object was to create laughter in composing such stories; whereas it is incredible that he who left behind him <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>  for a whole nation, regarding which he wished to persuade his subjects that they were given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should have written words so little to the purpose,  and have said without any meaning, <q>He placed the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, and the flaming sword, which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life,</q> or made any other statement regarding the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which is the subject of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> investigation by the Hebrew sages.</p>

<p>In the next place, Celsus, after heaping together, simply as mere assertions, the varying opinions of some of the ancients regarding the world, and the origin of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, alleges that <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who have left to us our books, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> at all what the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the world is, and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, have woven together a web of sheer nonsense.</q>  If he had shown, now, <em>how</em> it appeared to him that the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> contained <q>sheer nonsense,</q> we should have tried to demolish the arguments which appeared to him to establish their nonsensical character; but on the present occasion, following his own example, we also sportively give it as our opinion that Celsus, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing at all about the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the meaning and language of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,  composed a work which contained <q>sheer nonsense,</q> and boastfully gave it the title of a <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> discourse.</q> And since he makes the statements about the <q>days of creation</q> ground of accusation&mdash;as if he understood them clearly and correctly, some of which elapsed <em>before</em> the creation of light and heaven, and sun, and moon, and stars, and some of them <em>after</em> the creation of these&mdash;we shall only make this observation, that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> must then have forgotten that he had said a little before, <q>that in six days the creation of the world had been finished,</q> and that in consequence of this act of forgetfulness he subjoins to these words the following: <q>This is the book of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in the day when God made the heaven and the earth!</q> But it is not in the least credible, that after what he had said respecting the six days, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> should immediately add, without a special meaning, the words, <q>in the day that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the heavens and the earth;</q> and if any one thinks that these words may be referred to the statement, <q>In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth,</q> let him observe that before the words, <q>Let there be light, and there was light,</q> and these, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> called the light day,</q> it has been stated that <q>in the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 51</h2>

<p>On the present occasion, however, it is not our object to enter into an explanation of the subject of intelligent and sensible beings,  nor of the manner in which the different kinds  of days were allotted to both sorts, nor to investigate the details which belong to the subject, for we should need whole treatises for the exposition of the Mosaic cosmogony; and that work we had already performed, to the best of our ability, a considerable time before the commencement of this answer to Celsus, when we discussed with such measure of capacity as we then possessed the question of the Mosaic cosmogony of the six days. We must keep in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, however, that the Word promises to the righteous through the mouth of Isaiah, that days will come  when not the sun, but the Lord Himself, will be to them an everlasting light, and God will be their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.  And it is from misunderstanding, I think, some pestilent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which gave an erroneous interpretation to the words, <q>Let there be light,</q> as if they were the expression of a <em>wish</em>  merely on the part of the Creator, that Celsus made the remark: <q>The Creator did not borrow light from above, like those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who kindle their lamps at those of their neighbours.</q> Misunderstanding, moreover, another impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, he has said: <q>If, indeed, there did exist an accursed god opposed to the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who did this contrary to his approval, why did he lend him the light?</q> So far are we from offering a defence of such puerilities, that we desire, on the contrary, distinctly to arraign the statements of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as erroneous, and to undertake to refute, not those of their opinions with which we are <em>unacquainted</em>, as Celsus does, but those of which we have attained an accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, derived in part from the statements of their own adherents, and partly from a careful perusal of their writings.</p>

<h2>Chapter 52</h2>

<p>Celsus proceeds as follows: <q>With regard to the origin of the world and its destruction, whether it is to be regarded as uncreated and indestructible, or as created indeed, but not destructible, or the reverse, I at present say nothing.</q> For this reason we too say nothing on these points, as the work in hand does not require it. Nor do we allege that the Spirit of the universal God mingled itself in things here below as in things alien to itself,  as might appear from the expression, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> moved upon the water;</q> nor do we assert that certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> devices directed against His Spirit, as if by a different creator from the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which were tolerated by the Supreme Divinity, needed to be completely frustrated. And, accordingly, I have nothing further to say to those  who utter such absurdities; nor to Celsus, who does not refute them with ability. For he ought either not to have mentioned such matters at all, or else, in keeping with that character for philanthropy which he assumes, have carefully set them forth, and then endeavoured to rebut these impious assertions. Nor have we ever heard that the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after giving his spirit to the creator, demands it back again. Proceeding next foolishly to assail these impious assertions, he asks: <q>What god gives anything with the intention of demanding it back? For it is the mark of a needy person to demand back (what he has given), whereas God stands in need of nothing.</q> To this he adds, as if saying something clever against certain parties: <q>Why, when he lent (his spirit), was he <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that he was lending it to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> being?</q> He asks, further: <q>Why does he pass without notice  a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> creator who was counter-working his purposes?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 53</h2>

<p>In the next place, mixing up together various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and not observing that some statements are the utterances of one <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, and others of a different one, he brings forward the objections which we raised against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>.  And, probably, having heard them from some paltry and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> individuals,  he assails the very arguments which combat them, but not in a way that shows much intelligence. Quoting then our arguments against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and not observing that it is <em>against</em> <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> that he is speaking, he asks: <q>Why does he send secretly, and destroy the works which he has created? Why does he secretly employ force, and persuasion, and deceit? Why does he allure those who, as you assert, have been condemned or accused by him, and carry them away like a slave-dealer? Why does he teach them to steal away from their Lord? Why to flee from their father? Why does he claim them for himself against the father's will? Why does he profess to be the father of strange children?</q> To these questions he subjoins the following remark, as if by way of expressing his surprise:  <q>Venerable, indeed, is the god who desires to be the father of those sinners who are condemned by another (god), and of the needy,  and, as themselves say, of the very offscourings  (of men), and who is unable to capture and punish his messenger, who escaped from him!</q> After this, as if addressing us who acknowledge that this world is not the work of a different and strange god, he continues in the following strain: <q>If these are his works, how is it that God created <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? And how is it that he cannot persuade and admonish (men)? And how is it that he repents on account of the ingratitude and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of men? He finds fault, moreover, with his own handwork,  and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, and threatens, and destroys his own offspring? Whither can he transport them out of this world, which he himself has made?</q> Now it does not appear to me that by these remarks he makes clear what <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></q> is; and although there have been among the Greeks many <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> who differ as to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he hastily concludes, as if it were a consequence of our maintaining that this world also is a work of the universal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that in <em>our</em> judgment <em>God</em> is the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Let it be, however, regarding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as it may&mdash; whether created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or not&mdash; it nevertheless follows only as a <em>result</em> when you compare the principal design.  And I am greatly surprised if the inference regarding God's authorship of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which he thinks follows from our maintaining that this world also is the work of the universal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not follow too from his <em>own</em> statements. For one might say to Celsus: <q>If these are His works, how is it that God created <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? And how is it that He cannot persuade and admonish men?</q> It is indeed the greatest <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in reasoning to accuse those who are of different opinions of holding unsound doctrines, when the accuser himself is much more liable to the same charge with regard to his own.</p>

<h2>Chapter 54</h2>

<p>Let us see, then, briefly what <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture has to say regarding good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and what answer we are to return to the questions, <q>How is it that God created <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?</q> and, <q>How is He incapable of persuading and admonishing men?</q> Now, according to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> actions are good, as, properly speaking, the reverse of these are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. We shall be satisfied with quoting on the present occasion some verses from the <a href="../bible/psa033.htm">thirty-fourth Psalm</a>, to the following effect: <q>They that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing. Come, you children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord . What man is he that desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good? Keep your tongue from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and your lips from speaking guile. Depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do good.</q>  Now, the injunctions to <q>depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and to do good,</q> do not refer either to <em>corporeal</em> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> or <em>corporeal</em> blessings, as they are termed by some, nor to external things at all, but to blessings and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of a <em>spiritual</em> kind; since he who departs from such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and performs such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> actions, will, as one who desires the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, come to the enjoyment of it; and as one loving to see <q>good days,</q> in which the word of righteousness will be the Sun, he will see them, God taking him away from this <q>present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> world,</q>  and from those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days concerning which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: <q>Redeeming the time, because the days are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 55</h2>

<p>Passages, indeed, might be found where corporeal and external (benefits) are improperly  called <q>good,</q>&mdash; those things, viz., which contribute to the natural life, while those which do the reverse are termed <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> It is in this sense that Job says to his wife: <q>If we have received good at the hand of the Lord, shall we not also receive <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>!</q>  Since, then, there is found in the sacred Scriptures, in a certain passage, this statement put into the mouth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>I make peace, and create <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;</q>  and again another, where it is said of Him that <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> came down from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem, the noise of chariots and horsemen,</q> &mdash; passages which have disturbed many readers of Scripture, who are unable to see what Scripture means by <q>good</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q>&mdash; it is probable that Celsus, being perplexed thereby, gave utterance to the question, <q>How is it that God created <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?</q> or, perhaps, having heard some one discussing the matters relating to it in an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> manner, he made this statement which we have noticed. We, on the other hand, maintain that <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> or <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>,</q> and the actions which proceed from it, were <em>not</em> created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if God created that which is <em>really</em> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, how was it possible that the proclamation regarding (the last) judgment should be confidently announced,  which informs us that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are to be punished for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> in proportion to the amount of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, while those who have lived a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life, or performed <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> actions, will be in the enjoyment of blessedness, and will receive rewards from God? I am well aware that those who would daringly assert that these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> were created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will quote certain expressions of Scripture (in their support), because we are not able to show one consistent series  of passages; for although Scripture (generally) blames the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and approves of the righteous, it nevertheless contains some statements which, although comparatively  few in number, seem to disturb the minds of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> readers of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture. I have not, however, deemed it appropriate to my present treatise to quote on the present occasion those discordant statements, which are many in number,  and their explanations, which would require a long array of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. Evils, then, if those be meant which are <em>properly</em> so called, were <em>not</em> created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but some, although <em>few</em> in comparison with the order of the <em>whole</em> world, <em>have</em> resulted from His principal works, as there follow from the chief works of the carpenter such things as spiral shavings and sawdust,  or as architects might appear to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the rubbish  which lies around their buildings in the form of the filth which drops from the stones and the plaster.</p>

<h2>Chapter 56</h2>

<p>If we speak, however, of what are called <q>corporeal</q> and <q>external</q> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>&mdash;which are improperly so termed&mdash;then it may be granted that there <em>are</em> occasions when some of these have been called into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that by their means the conversion of certain individuals might be effected. And what absurdity would follow from such a course? For as, if we should hear those sufferings  improperly termed <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a></q> which are inflicted by fathers, and instructors, and pedagogues upon those who are under their care, or upon patients who are operated upon or cauterized by the surgeons in order to effect a cure, we were to say that a father was ill-treating his son, or pedagogues and instructors their pupils, or physicians their patients, no blame would be laid upon the operators or chastisers; so, in the same way, if God is said to bring upon men such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> for the conversion and cure of those who need this discipline, there would be no absurdity in the view, nor would <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> come down from the Lord upon the gates of Jerusalem,</q> &mdash; which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> consist of the punishments inflicted upon the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> by their enemies with a view to their conversion; nor would one visit <q>with a rod the transgressions of those who forsake the law of the Lord, and their iniquities with stripes;</q>  nor could it be said, <q>You have coals of fire to set upon them; they shall be to you a help.</q>  In the same way also we explain the expressions, <q>I, who make peace, and create <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;</q>  for He calls into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> <q>corporeal</q> or <q>external</q> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, while purifying and training those who would not be disciplined by the word and sound doctrine. This, then, is our answer to the question, <q>How is it that God created <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 57</h2>

<p>With respect to the question, <q>How is he incapable of persuading and admonishing men?</q> it has been already stated that, if such an objection were really a ground of charge, then the objection of Celsus might be brought against those who accept the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. Any one might answer the charge that God is <em>incapable</em> of admonishing men; for He conveys His admonitions throughout the whole of Scripture, and by means of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who, through God's gracious appointment, are the instructors of His hearers. Unless, indeed, some peculiar meaning be understood to attach to the word <q>admonish,</q> as if it signified both to penetrate into the mind of the person admonished, and to make him hear the words of his  instructor, which is contrary to the usual meaning of the word. To the objection, <q>How is he incapable of persuading?</q>&mdash; which also might be brought against all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>&mdash;we have to make the following remarks. Since the expression <q>to be persuaded</q> belongs to those words which are termed, so to speak, <q>reciprocal</q>  (compare the phrase <q>to shave a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q> when he makes an effort to submit himself to the barber ), there is for this reason needed not merely the effort of him who persuades, but also the submission, so to speak, which is to be yielded to the persuader, or the acceptance of what is said by him. And therefore it must not be said that it is because God is incapable of persuading men that they are not persuaded, but because they will not accept the faithful words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And if one were to apply this expression to men who are the <q>artificers of persuasion,</q>  he would not be wrong; for it is possible for a man who has thoroughly learned the principles of rhetoric, and who employs them properly, to do his utmost to persuade, and yet appear to fail, because he cannot overcome the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him who ought to yield to his persuasive arts. Moreover, that persuasion does not come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although persuasive words may be uttered by him, is distinctly taught by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when he says: <q>This persuasion comes not of him that calls you.</q>  Such also is the view indicated by these words: <q>If you be willing and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you refuse and rebel, a sword shall devour you.</q>  For that one may (really) desire what is addressed to him by one who admonishes, and may become deserving of those promises of God which he hears, it is necessary to secure the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the hearer, and his inclination to what is addressed to him. And therefore it appears to me, that in the book of Deuteronomy the following words are uttered with peculiar emphasis: <q>And now, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to walk in all His ways, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, and to keep His commandments?</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 58</h2>

<p>There is next to be answered the following query: <q>And how is it that he repents when men become ungrateful and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; and finds fault with his own handwork, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, and threatens, and destroys his own offspring?</q> Now Celsus here <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniates</a> and falsities what is written in the book of Genesis to the following effect: <q>And the Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of men upon the earth was increasing, and that every one in his heart carefully meditated to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> continually, was grieved  He had made man upon the earth. And God meditated in His heart, and said, I will destroy man, whom I have made, from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and creeping thing, and fowl of the air, because I am grieved  that I made them;</q>  quoting words which are not written in Scripture, as if they conveyed the meaning of what was actually written. For there is no mention in these words of the repentance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor of His blaming and hating His own handwork. And if there is the appearance of God threatening the catastrophe of the deluge, and thus destroying His own children in it, we have to answer that, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, the supposed threatening has for its object the conversion of the hearers, while the destruction of men by the flood is a purification of the earth, as certain among the Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of no mean repute have indicated by the expression: <q>When the gods purify the earth.</q>  And with respect to the transference to God of those anthropopathic phrases, some remarks have been already made by us in the preceding pages.</p>

<h2>Chapter 59</h2>

<p>Celsus, in the next place, suspecting, or perhaps seeing clearly enough, the answer which might be returned by those who defend the destruction of men by the deluge, continues: <q>But if he does not destroy his own offspring, whither does he convey them out of this world  which he himself created?</q> To this we reply, that God by no means removes out of the whole world, consisting of heaven and earth, those who suffered death by the deluge, but removes them from a life in the flesh, and, having set them free from their bodies, liberates them at the same time from an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> upon earth, which in many parts of Scripture it is usual to call the <q>world.</q> In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John especially, we may frequently find the regions of earth  termed <q>world,</q> as in the passage, <q>He was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light, which lightens every man that comes into the 'world;'</q>  as also in this, <q>In the world you shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.</q>  If, then, we understand by <q>removing out of the world</q> a transference from <q>regions on earth,</q> there is nothing absurd in the expression. If, on the contrary, the system of things which consists of heaven and earth be termed <q>world,</q> then those who perished in the deluge are by no means removed out of the so-called <q>world.</q> And yet, indeed, if we have regard to the words, <q>Looking not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen;</q>  and also to these, <q>For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,</q> &mdash; we might say that he who dwells amid the <q>invisible</q> things, and what are called generally <q>things not seen,</q> is gone out of the world, the Word having removed him hence, and transported him to the heavenly regions, in order to behold all beautiful things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 60</h2>

<p>But after this investigation of his assertions, as if his object were to swell his book by many words, he repeats, in different language, the same charges which we have examined a little ago, saying: <q>By far the most silly thing is the distribution of the creation of the world over certain days, <em>before days <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a></em>: for, as the heaven was not yet created, nor the foundation of the earth yet laid,  nor the sun yet revolving,  how could there be <em>days</em>?</q> Now, what difference is there between these words and the following: <q>Moreover, taking and looking at these things from the beginning, would it not be absurd in the first and greatest God to issue the command, Let this (first thing) come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and this second thing, and this (third); and after accomplishing so much on the first day, to do so much more again on the second, and third, and fourth, and fifth, and sixth?</q> We answered to the best of our ability this objection to God's <q>commanding this first, second, and third thing to be created,</q> when we quoted the words, <q>He said, and it was done; He commanded, and all things stood fast;</q>  remarking that the immediate  Creator, and, as it were, very Maker  of the world was the Word, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; while the Father of the Word, by commanding His own Son&mdash; the Word&mdash; to create the world, is <em>primarily</em> Creator. And with regard to the creation of the light upon the first day, and of the firmament upon the second, and of the gathering together of the waters that are under the heaven into their several reservoirs  on the third (the earth thus causing to sprout forth those (fruits) which are under the control of nature alone ), and of the (great) lights and stars upon the fourth, and of aquatic  animals upon the fifth, and of land animals and man upon the sixth, we have treated to the best of our ability in our notes upon Genesis, as well as in the foregoing pages, when we found fault with those who, taking the words in their <em>apparent</em> signification, said that the time of six days was occupied in the creation of the world, and quoted the words: <q>These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 61</h2>

<p>Again, not understanding the meaning of the words, <q>And God ended  on the sixth day His works which He had made, and ceased  on the seventh day from all His works which He had made: and God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because on it He had ceased  from all His works which He had begun to make;</q>  and imagining the expression, <q>He <em>ceased</em> on the seventh day,</q> to be the same as this, <q>He <em>rested</em>  on the seventh day,</q> he makes the remark: <q>After this, indeed, he is weary, like a very bad workman, who stands in need of rest to refresh himself!</q> For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing of the day of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and rest of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which follows the completion of the world's creation, and which lasts during the duration of the world, and in which all those will keep festival with God who have done all <em>their</em> works in <em>their</em> six days, and who, because they have omitted none of their duties,  will ascend to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> (of celestial things), and to the assembly of righteous and blessed beings. In the next place, as if either the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> made such a statement, or as if we ourselves so spoke of God as having rested from fatigue, he continues: <q>It is not in keeping with the fitness of things  that the first God should feel fatigue, or work with His hands,  or give forth commands.</q> Celsus says, that it is not in keeping with the fitness of things that the first God should feel fatigue. Now we would say that neither does <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> feel fatigue, nor any of those beings who belong to a better and diviner order of things, because the sensation of fatigue is peculiar to those who are in the body. You can examine whether this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of those who possess a body of any kind, or of those who have an <em>earthly</em> body, or one a little better than this. But <q>neither is it consistent with the fitness of things that the first God should work with His own hands.</q> If you understand the words <q>work with His own hands</q> <em>literally</em>, then neither are they applicable to the <em>second</em> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor to any other being partaking of divinity. But suppose that they are spoken in an improper and figurative sense, so that we may translate the following expressions, <q>And the firmament shows forth His handywork,</q>  and <q>the heavens are the work of Your hands,</q>  and any other similar phrases, in a figurative manner, so far as respects the <q>hands</q> and <q>limbs</q> of Deity, where is the absurdity in the words, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> thus working with His own hands?</q> And as there is no absurdity in God thus working, so neither is there in His issuing <q>commands;</q> so that what is done at His bidding should be beautiful and praiseworthy, because it was God who commanded it to be performed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 62</h2>

<p>Celsus, again, having perhaps misunderstood the words, <q>For the mouth of the Lord has spoken it,</q>  or perhaps because some <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> individuals had rashly ventured upon the explanation of such things, and not understanding, moreover, on what principles parts called after the names of the bodily members are assigned to the attributes  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, asserts: <q>He has neither mouth nor voice.</q> Truly, indeed, God can have no voice, if the voice is a concussion of the air, or a stroke on the air, or a species of air, or any other definition which may be given to the voice by those who are skilled in such matters; but what is called the <q>voice of God</q> is said to be <em>seen</em> as <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> voice</q> by the people in the passage, <q>And all the people saw the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  the word <q>saw</q> being taken, agreeably to the custom of Scripture, in a spiritual sense. Moreover, he alleges that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> possesses nothing else of which <em>we</em> have any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>;</q> but of what things <em>we</em> have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he gives no indication. If he means <q>limbs,</q> we agree with him, understanding the things <q>of which we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></q> to be those called corporeal, and pretty generally so termed. But if we are to understand the words <q>of which <em>we</em> have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></q> in a universal sense, then there are many things of which we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, (and which may be attributed to God); for He possesses <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and blessedness, and divinity. If we, however, put a higher meaning upon the words, <q>of which <em>we</em> have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> since all that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is less than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is no absurdity in our also admitting that God possesses none of those things <q>of which <em>we</em> have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> For the attributes which belong to God are far superior to all things with which not merely the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man is acquainted, but even that of those who have risen far above it. And if he had read the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, David on the one hand saying, <q>But You are the same,</q>  and Malachi on the other, <q>I am (the Lord), and change not,</q>  he would have observed that none of us assert that there is any change in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either in act or thought. For abiding the same, He administers mutable things according to their nature, and His word elects to undertake their administration.</p>

<h2>Chapter 63</h2>

<p>Celsus, not observing the difference between <q> <em>after</em> the image of God</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image,</q> next asserts that the <q><a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature</q> is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;the very word and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and also the very wisdom, being the image of His goodness, while man has been created <em>after</em> the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; moreover, that every man whose head is Christ is the image and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;and further, not observing to which of the characteristics of humanity the expression <q>after the image of God</q> belongs, and that it consists in a nature which never had nor longer has <q>the old man with his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>,</q> being called <q>after the image of Him who created it,</q> from its not possessing these qualities,&mdash; he maintains: <q>Neither did He make man His image; for God is not such an one, nor like any other species of (visible) being.</q> Is it possible to suppose that the element which is <q>after the image of God</q> should exist in the inferior part&mdash; I mean the body&mdash; of a compound being like man, because Celsus has explained that to be made after the image of God? For if that which is <q>after the image of God</q> be in the body only, the better part, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, has been deprived of that which is <q>after His image,</q> and this (distinction) exists in the corruptible body&mdash;an assertion which is made by none of us. But if that which is <q>after the image of God</q> be in <em>both together</em>, then God must necessarily be a compound being, and consist, as it were, of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, in order that the element which is <q>after God's image,</q> the better part, may be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; while the inferior part, and that which <q>is according to the body,</q> may be in the body&mdash;an assertion, again, which is made by none of us. It remains, therefore, that that which is <q>after the image of God</q> must be understood to be in our <q>inner man,</q> which is also renewed, and whose nature it is to be <q>after the image of Him who created it,</q> when a man becomes <q>perfect,</q> as <q>our Father in heaven is perfect,</q> and hears the command, <q>Be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, for I the Lord your God am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q>  and learning the precept, <q>Be followers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  receives into his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the traits of God's image. The body, moreover, of him who possesses such a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> God dwells, because it has been made after His image. </p>

<h2>Chapter 64</h2>

<p>Celsus, again, brings together a number of statements, which he gives as admissions on our part, but which no intelligent <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> would allow. For not one of us asserts that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> partakes of form or colour.</q> Nor does He even partake of <q>motion,</q> because He stands firm, and His nature is permanent, and He invites the righteous man also to do the same, saying: <q>But as for you, stand here by Me.</q>  And if certain expressions indicate a kind of motion, as it were, on His part, such as this, <q>They heard the voice of the Lord God <em>walking</em> in the garden in the cool of the day,</q>  we must understand them in this way, that it is by sinners that God is understood as moving, or as we understand the <q>sleep</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is taken in a figurative sense, or His <q><a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>,</q> or any other similar attribute. But <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not partake even of substance.</q>  For He is partaken of (by others) rather than that Himself partakes of them, and He is partaken of by those who have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. Our Saviour, also, does not partake of righteousness; but being Himself <q>righteousness,</q> He is partaken of <em>by</em> the righteous. A discussion about <q>substance</q> would be protracted and difficult, and especially if it were a question whether that which is permanent and immaterial be <q>substance</q> properly so called, so that it would be found that God is <em>beyond</em> <q>substance,</q> communicating of His <q>substance,</q> by means of office and power,  to those to whom He communicates Himself by His Word, as He does to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself; or even if He <em>is</em> <q>substance,</q> yet He is said be in His nature <q>invisible,</q> in these words respecting our Saviour, who is said to be <q>the image of the <em>invisible</em> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  while from the term <q>invisible</q> it is indicated that He is <q>immaterial.</q> It is also a question for investigation, whether the <q>only-begotten</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature</q> is to be called <q>substance of substances,</q> and <q>idea of ideas,</q> and the <q>principle of all things,</q> while above all there is His Father and God. </p>

<h2>Chapter 65</h2>

<p>Celsus proceeds to say of God that <q>of Him are all things,</q> abandoning (in so speaking), I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how, all his principles;  while our <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declares, that <q>of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things,</q>  showing that He is the beginning of the substance of all things by the words <q>of Him,</q> and the bond of their subsistence by the expression <q>through Him,</q> and their final end by the terms <q>to Him.</q> Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, God is of nothing. But when Celsus adds, that <q>He is not to be reached by word,</q>  I make a distinction, and say that if he means the word that is in <em>us</em>&mdash; whether the word conceived in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or the word that is uttered &mdash; I, too, admit that God is not to be reached by word. If, however, we attend to the passage, <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  we are of opinion that God is to be reached by <em>this</em> Word, and is comprehended not by Him only, but by any one whatever to whom He may reveal the Father; and thus we shall prove the falsity of the assertion of Celsus, when he says, <q>Neither is God to be reached by word.</q> The statement, moreover, that <q>He cannot be expressed by name,</q> requires to be taken with a distinction. If he means, indeed, that there is no word or sign  that can represent the attributes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the statement is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, since there are many qualities which cannot be indicated by words. Who, for example, could describe in words the difference between the quality of sweetness in a palm and that in a fig? And who could distinguish and set forth in words the peculiar qualities of each individual thing? It is no wonder, then, if in this way God cannot be described by name. But if you take the phrase to mean that it is possible to represent by words something of God's attributes, in order to lead the hearer by the hand,  as it were, and so enable him to comprehend something of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so far as attainable by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, then there is no absurdity in saying that <q>He <em>can</em> be described by name.</q> And we make a similar distinction with regard to the expression, <q>for He has undergone no suffering that can be conveyed by words.</q> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the Deity is beyond all suffering. And so much on this point.</p>

<h2>Chapter 66</h2>

<p>Let us look also at his next statement, in which he introduces, as it were, a certain person, who, after hearing what has been said, expresses himself in the following manner, <q>How, then, shall I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God? And how shall I learn the way that leads to Him? And how will you show Him to me? Because now, indeed, you throw darkness before my eyes, and I see nothing distinctly.</q> He then answers, as it were, the individual who is thus perplexed, and thinks that he assigns the reason why darkness has been poured upon the eyes of him who uttered the foregoing words, when he asserts that <q>those whom one would lead forth out of darkness into the brightness of light, being unable to withstand its splendours, have their power of vision affected  and injured, and so <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they are smitten with blindness.</q> In answer to this, we would say that all those indeed sit in darkness, and are rooted in it, who fix their gaze upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> handiwork of painters, and moulders and sculptors, and who will not look upwards, and ascend in thought from all visible and sensible things, to the Creator of all things, who is light; while, on the other hand, every one is in light who has followed the radiance of the Word, who has shown in consequence of what <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and impiety, and want of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divine things these objects were worshipped instead of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who has conducted the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of him who desires to be saved towards the uncreated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is over all. For <q>the people that sat in darkness&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>&mdash; saw a great light, and to them who sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up,</q> &mdash; the God Jesus. No <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, then, would give Celsus, or any accuser of the divine Word, the answer, <q>How shall I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God?</q> for each one of them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> God according to his capacity. And no one asks, <q>How shall I learn the way which leads to Him?</q> because he has heard Him who says, <q>I am the way, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life,</q>  and has tasted, in the course of the journey, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which results from it. And not a single <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> would say to Celsus, <q>How will you show me God?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 67</h2>

<p>The remark, indeed, was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which Celsus made, that any one, on hearing his words, would answer, seeing that his words <em>are</em> words of darkness, <q>You pour darkness before my eyes.</q> Celsus verily, and those like him, do desire to pour darkness before our eyes: we, however, by means of the light of the Word, disperse the darkness of their impious opinions. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, indeed, could retort on Celsus, who says nothing that is distinct or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <q>I see nothing that is distinct among all <em>your</em> statements.</q> It is not, therefore, <q>out of darkness</q> into <q>the brightness of light</q> that Celsus leads us forth: he wishes, on the contrary, to transport us from light into darkness, making the darkness light and the light darkness, and exposing himself to the woe well described by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah in the following manner: <q>Woe unto them that put darkness for light, and light for darkness.</q>  But we, the eyes of whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> have been opened by the Word, and who see the difference between light and darkness, prefer by all means to take our stand <q>in the light,</q> and will have nothing to do with darkness at all. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, moreover, being endued with life, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to whom his full splendours are to be manifested, and to whom his light; for he does not display his brilliancy on account of the still existing weakness in the eyes of the recipient. And if we must speak at all of <q>sight being affected and injured,</q> what other eyes shall we say are in this condition, than his who is involved in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who is prevented by his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> from seeing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, however, by no means consider that they are blinded by the words of Celsus, or any other who is opposed to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But let those who perceive that they are blinded by following multitudes who are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and tribes of those who keep festivals to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, draw near to the Word, who can bestow the gift of sight,  in order that, like those poor and blind who had thrown themselves down by the wayside, and who were healed by Jesus because they said to Him, <q>Son of David, have mercy upon me,</q> they too may receive mercy and recover their eyesight,  fresh and beautiful, as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> can create it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 68</h2>

<p>Accordingly, if Celsus were to ask us how we think we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and how we shall be saved by Him, we would answer that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, which entered into those who seek Him, or who accept Him when He appears, is able to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and to reveal the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who was not seen (by any one) before the appearance of the Word. And who else is able to save and conduct the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things, save <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, who, <q>being in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> became flesh for the sake of those who had cleaved to the flesh, and had become as flesh, that He might be received by those who could not behold Him, inasmuch as He was the Word, and was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was God? And discoursing in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>,  and announcing Himself as flesh, He calls to Himself those who are flesh, that He may in the first place <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to be transformed according to the Word that was made flesh, and afterwards may lead them upwards to behold Him as He was before He became flesh; so that they, receiving the benefit, and ascending from their great introduction to Him, which was according to the flesh, say, <q>Even if we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ after the flesh, yet henceforth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> we Him no more.</q>  Therefore He became flesh, and having become flesh, <q>He tabernacled among us,</q>  not dwelling without us; and after tabernacling and dwelling <em>within</em> us, He did not continue in the form in which He first presented Himself, but caused us to ascend to the lofty mountain of His word, and showed us His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> form, and the splendour of His garments; and not His own form alone, but that also of the spiritual law, which is <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, seen in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> along with Jesus. He showed to us, moreover, all <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, which did not perish even after His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, but was received up into heaven, and whose <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> was Elijah. And he who beheld these things could say, <q>We beheld His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as of the only-begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  Celsus, then, has exhibited considerable <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in the imaginary answer to his question which he puts into our mouth, <q>How we think we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God? And how we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> we shall be saved by Him?</q> for our answer is what we have just stated.</p>

<h2>Chapter 69</h2>

<p>Celsus, however, asserts that the answer which we give is based upon a probable conjecture,  admitting that he describes our answer in the following terms: <q>Since God is great and difficult  to see,  He put His own Spirit into a body that resembled ours, and sent it down to us, that we might be enabled to hear Him and become acquainted with Him.</q> But the God and Father of all things is not the only being that is great in our judgment; for He has imparted (a share) of Himself and His greatness to His Only-begotten and First-born of every creature, in order that He, being the image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, might preserve, even in His greatness, the image of the Father. For it was not possible that there could exist a well-proportioned,  so to speak, and beautiful image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which did not at the same time preserve the image of His greatness. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, moreover, is in our judgment invisible, because He is not a body, while He <em>can</em> be seen by those who see with the heart, that is, the understanding; not indeed with any kind of heart, but with one which is pure. For it is inconsistent with the fitness of things that a polluted heart should look upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for that must be itself pure which would worthily behold that which is pure. Let it be granted, indeed, that God is <q>difficult to see,</q> yet He is not the only being who is so; for His Only-begotten also is <q>difficult to see.</q> For <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> is <q>difficult to see,</q> and so also is His  wisdom, by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created all things. For who is capable of seeing the wisdom which is displayed in each individual part of the whole system of things, and by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created every individual thing? It was not, then, because God was <q>difficult to see</q> that He sent God His Son to be an object <q>easy to be seen.</q>  And because Celsus does not understand this, he has represented us as saying, <q>Because God was 'difficult to see,' He put His own Spirit in a body resembling ours, and sent it down to us, that we might be enabled to hear Him and become acquainted with Him.</q> Now, as we have stated, the Son also is <q>difficult to see,</q> because He is <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, through whom all things were made, and who <q>tabernacled among us.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 70</h2>

<p>If Celsus, indeed, had understood our teaching regarding the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that <q>as many as are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, these are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  he would not have returned to himself the answer which he represents as coming from us, that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> put His own Spirit into a body, and sent it down to us;</q> for God is perpetually bestowing of His own Spirit to those who are capable of receiving it, although it is not by way of division and separation that He dwells in (the hearts of) the deserving. Nor is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, in our opinion, a <q>body,</q> any more than fire is a <q>body,</q> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be in the passage, <q>Our God is a consuming fire.</q>  For all these are figurative expressions, employed to denote the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <q>intelligent beings</q> by means of familiar and corporeal terms. In the same way, too, if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are called <q>wood, and straw, and stubble,</q> we shall not maintain that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are corporeal; and if blessings are termed <q>gold, and silver, and precious stones,</q>  we shall not maintain that blessings are <q>corporeal;</q> so also, if God be said to be a fire that consumes wood, and straw, and stubble, and all substance  of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we shall not understand Him to be a <q>body,</q> so neither do we understand Him to be a body if He should be called <q>fire.</q> In this way, if God be called <q>spirit,</q>  we do not mean that He is a <q>body.</q> For it is the custom of Scripture to give to <q>intelligent beings</q> the names of <q>spirits</q> and <q>spiritual things,</q> by way of distinction from those which are the objects of <q>sense;</q> as when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>But our sufficiency is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who has also made us able ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; not of the letter, but of the spirit; for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life,</q>  where by the <q>letter</q> he means that <q>exposition of Scripture which is apparent to the senses,</q>  while by the <q>spirit</q> that which is the object of the <q>understanding.</q> It is the same, too, with the expression, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a Spirit.</q> And because the prescriptions of the law were <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> both by <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in a corporeal and literal  manner, our Saviour said to the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <q>The hour is coming, when neither in Jerusalem, nor in this mountain, shall you worship the Father. God is a Spirit; and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  And by these words He taught men that God must be worshipped not in the flesh, and with fleshly <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, but in the spirit. And He will be understood to be a Spirit in proportion as the worship rendered to Him is rendered in spirit, and with understanding. It is not, however, with images  that we are to worship the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but <q>in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> which <q>came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,</q> after the giving of the law by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. For when we turn to the Lord (and the Lord is a Spirit ), He takes away the veil which lies upon the heart when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is read.</p>

<h2>Chapter 71</h2>

<p>Celsus accordingly, as not understanding the doctrine relating to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> (<q>for the natural man receives not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, because they are spiritually discerned</q> ), weaves together (such a web) as pleases himself,  imagining that we, in calling God a Spirit, differ in no respect in this particular from the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> among the Greeks, who maintain that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a Spirit, diffused through all things, and containing all things within Himself.</q> Now the superintendence and <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God does extend through all things, but not in the way that spirit does, according to the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>. Providence indeed contains all things that are its objects, and comprehends them all, but not as a containing body includes its contents, because they also are <q>body,</q>  but as a <em>divine</em> power does it comprehend what it contains. According to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the Porch, indeed, who assert that principles are <q>corporeal,</q> and who on that account make all things perishable, and who venture even to make the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things capable of perishing, the very <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who descends even to the lowest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, would be&mdash; did it not appear to them to be too gross an incongruity &mdash; nothing else than a <q>corporeal</q> spirit; whereas, in our opinion&mdash;who endeavour to demonstrate that the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is superior to all <q>corporeal</q> nature, and that it is an invisible substance, and incorporeal,&mdash; <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, by whom all things were made, who came, in order that all things might be made by the Word, not to men only, but to what are deemed the very lowest of things, under the dominion of nature alone, would be no body. The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, then, may consign all things to destruction by fire; we, however, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of no incorporeal substance that is destructible by fire, nor (do we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or the substance of <q><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> or of <q>thrones,</q> or dominions, or <q>principalities,</q> or <q>powers,</q> can be dissolved by fire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 72</h2>

<p>It is therefore in vain that Celsus asserts, as one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, that <q>as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, is a Spirit, this very <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> would not be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.</q> He next becomes confused in his statements, as if there were some of us who did not admit that God is a Spirit, but maintain that only with regard to His Son, and he thinks that he can answer us by saying that there <q>is no kind of spirit which lasts for ever.</q> This is much the same as if, when we term God a <q>consuming fire,</q> he were to say that there <q>is no kind of fire which lasts for ever;</q> not observing the sense in which we say that our God is a fire, and what the things are which He consumes, viz., <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. For it becomes a God of goodness, after each individual has shown, by his efforts, what kind of combatant he has been, to consume <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> by the fire of His chastisements. He proceeds, in the next place, to assume what we do not maintain, that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must necessarily have given up the ghost;</q> from which also it follows that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> could not have risen again with His body. For God would not have received back the spirit which He had surrendered after it had been stained by contact with the body. It is foolish, however, for us to answer statements as ours which were never made by us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 73</h2>

<p>He proceeds to repeat himself, and after saying a great deal which he had said before, and ridiculing the birth of God from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>&mdash;to which we have already replied as we best could&mdash;he adds the following: <q>If God had wished to send down His Spirit from Himself, what need was there to breathe it into the womb of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? For as one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> already how to form men, He could also have fashioned a body for this person, without casting His own Spirit into so much pollution;  and in this way He would not have been received with incredulity, if He had derived His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> immediately from above.</q> He had made these remarks, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15448a.htm">pure and virgin birth</a>, unaccompanied by any corruption, of that body which was to minister to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men. For, quoting the sayings of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>,  and affecting not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the doctrine about <q>things indifferent,</q> he thinks that the divine nature was cast amid pollution, and was stained either by being in the body of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, until a body was formed around it, or by assuming a body. And in this he acts like those who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the sun's rays are polluted by dung and by foul-smelling bodies, and do not remain pure amid such things. If, however, according to the view of Celsus, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had been fashioned without generation, those who beheld the body would at once have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that it had not been formed by generation; and yet an object, when seen, does not at the same time indicate the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that from which it has derived its origin. For example, suppose that there were some honey (placed before one) which had not been manufactured by bees, no one could tell from the taste or sight that it was not their workmanship, because the honey which comes from bees does not make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> its origin by the senses,  but experience alone can tell that it does not proceed from them. In the same way, too, experience teaches that wine comes from the vine, for taste does not enable us to distinguish (the wine) which comes from the vine. In the same manner, therefore, the visible  body does not make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the manner of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. And you will be induced to accept this view,  by (regarding) the heavenly bodies, whose <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and splendour we perceive as we gaze at them; and yet, I presume, their appearance does not suggest to us whether they are created or uncreated; and accordingly different opinions have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> on these points. And yet those who say that they are created are not agreed as to the manner of their creation, for their appearance does not suggest it, although the force of reason  may have discovered that they are created, and how their creation was effected.</p>

<h2>Chapter 74</h2>

<p>After this he returns to the subject of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> opinions (having already spoken frequently of them), and states some of them correctly, while others he has misunderstood; these, however, it is not necessary for us to answer or refute. Again, after this he brings forward the various arguments that may be urged on <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> behalf, and also against him, enumerating what the opinions are which exonerate him from the charges, and what expose him to them; and when he desires to support the statement which declares that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> has been the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>&mdash;in order to found a charge against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and his followers&mdash;he distinctly asks, <q>How could he, who was punished in such a manner, be shown to be God's Son, unless these things had been predicted of him?</q> He next proceeds to jest, and, as his custom is, to pour ridicule upon the subject, introducing <q>two sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one the son of the Creator,  and the other the son of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and he portrays their single combats, saying that the Theomachies of the Fathers are like the battles between quails;  or that the Fathers, becoming useless through age, and falling into their dotage  do not meddle at all with one another, but leave their sons to fight it out.</q> The remark which he made formerly we will turn against himself: <q>What old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> would not be ashamed to lull a child to sleep with such stories as he has inserted in the work which he entitles <em>A True Discourse</em>? For when he ought seriously  to apply himself to argument, he leaves serious argument aside, and betakes himself to jesting and buffoonery, imagining that he is writing mimes or scoffing verses; not observing that such a method of procedure defeats his purpose, which is to make us abandon <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and give in our adherence to his opinions, which, perhaps, had they been stated with some degree of gravity,  would have appeared more likely to convince, whereas since he continues to ridicule, and scoff, and play the buffoon, we answer that it is because he has no argument of weight  (for such he neither had, nor could understand) that he has betaken himself to such drivelling.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 75</h2>

<p>To the preceding remarks he adds the following: <q>Since a divine Spirit inhabited the body (of Jesus), it must certainly have been different from that of other beings, in respect of grandeur, or beauty, or strength, or voice, or impressiveness,  or persuasiveness. For it is impossible that He, to whom was imparted some divine quality beyond other beings, should not differ from others; whereas this person did not differ in any respect from another, but was, as they report, little, and ill-favoured, and ignoble.</q>  Now it is evident by these words, that when Celsus wishes to bring a charge against Jesus, he adduces the sacred writings, as one who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> them to be writings apparently fitted to afford a handle for a charge against Him; but wherever, in the same writings, statements would appear to be made opposed to those charges which are adduced, he pretends not even to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them! There are, indeed, admitted to be recorded some statements respecting the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> having been <q>ill-favoured;</q> not, however, <q>ignoble,</q> as has been stated, nor is there any certain evidence that he was <q>little.</q> The language of Isaiah runs as follows, who prophesied regarding Him that He would come and visit the multitude, not in comeliness of form, nor in any surpassing beauty: <q>Lord, who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report, and to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed? He made announcement before Him, as a child, as a root in a thirsty ground. He has no form nor <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and we beheld Him, and He had no form nor beauty; but His form was without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and inferior to that of the sons of men.</q>  These passages, then, Celsus listened to, because he thought they were of use to him in bringing a charge against Jesus; but he paid no attention to the words of the <a href="../bible/psa044.htm">forty-fifth Psalm</a>, and why it is then said, <q>Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O most mighty, with Your comeliness and beauty; and continue, and prosper, and reign.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 76</h2>

<p>Let it be supposed, however, that he had not read the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, or that he <em>had</em> read it, but had been drawn away by those who misinterpreted it as not being spoken of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. What has he to say of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, in the narratives of which Jesus ascended up into a high mountain, and was transfigured before the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and was seen in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, when both <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias, <q>being seen in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, spoke of the decease which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem?</q>  or when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>We beheld Him, and He had no form nor beauty,</q> etc.? And Celsus accepts this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> as referring to Jesus, being blinded in so accepting it, and not seeing that it is a great <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the Jesus who appeared to be <q>without <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a></q> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, that His very appearance should have been made the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> many years before His birth. But if another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> speak of His comeliness and beauty, he will no longer accept the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> as referring to Christ! And if it were to be clearly ascertained from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> that <q>He had no form nor beauty, but that His appearance was without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and inferior to that of the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> it might be said that it was not with reference to the prophetic writings, but to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, that Celsus made his remarks. But now, as neither the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> nor the apostolic writings indicate that <q>He had no form nor beauty,</q> it is evident that we must accept the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and this will prevent the charge against Jesus from being advanced. </p>

<h2>Chapter 77</h2>

<p>But again, how did he who said, <q>Since a divine Spirit inhabited the body (of Jesus), it must certainly have been different from that of other beings in respect of grandeur, or voice, or strength, or impressiveness, or persuasiveness,</q> not observe the changing relation of His body according to the capacity of the spectators (and therefore its corresponding utility), inasmuch as it appeared to each one of such a nature as it was requisite for him to behold it? Moreover it is not a subject of wonder that the matter, which is by nature susceptible of being altered and changed, and of being transformed into anything which the Creator chooses, and is capable of receiving all the qualities which the Artificer desires, should at one time possess a quality, agreeably to which it is said, <q>He had no form nor beauty,</q> and at another, one so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and majestic, and marvellous, that the spectators of such surpassing loveliness&mdash; three <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who had ascended (the mount) with Jesus&mdash; should fall upon their faces. He will say, however, that these are inventions, and in no respect different from myths, as are also the other marvels related of Jesus; which objection we have answered at greater length in what has gone before. But there is also something mystical in this doctrine, which announces that the varying appearances of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> are to be referred to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the divine Word, who does not show Himself in the same manner to the multitude as He does to those who are capable of following Him to the high mountain which we have mentioned; for to those who still remain below, and are not yet prepared to ascend, the Word <q>has neither form nor beauty,</q> because to such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> His form is <q>without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>,</q> and inferior to the words given forth by men, which are figuratively termed <q>sons of men.</q> For we might say that the words of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>&mdash; who are <q>sons of men</q>&mdash; appear far more beautiful than the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who is proclaimed to the multitude, and who also exhibits (what is called) the <q>foolishness of preaching,</q> and on account of this apparent <q>foolishness of preaching</q> those who look at this alone say, <q>We saw Him; but He had no form nor beauty.</q> To those, indeed, who have received power to follow Him, in order that they may attend Him even when He ascends to the <q>lofty mount,</q> He <em>has</em> a diviner appearance, which they behold, if there happens to be (among them) a Peter, who has received within himself the edifice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> based upon the Word, and who has gained such a habit (of goodness) that none of the gates of Hades will prevail against him, having been exalted by the Word from the gates of death, that he may <q>publish the praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the gates of the daughter of Sion,</q> and any others who have derived their birth from impressive preaching,  and who are not at all inferior to <q>sons of thunder.</q> But how can Celsus and the enemies of the divine Word, and those who have not examined the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the meaning of the different appearances of Jesus? And I refer also to the different stages of His life, and to any actions performed by Him before His sufferings, and after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the dead.</p>

<h2>Chapter 78</h2>

<p>Celsus next makes certain observations of the following nature: <q>Again, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, like Jupiter in the comedy, should, on awaking from a lengthened slumber, desire to rescue the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, why did He send this Spirit of which you speak into one corner (of the earth)? He ought to have breathed it alike into many bodies, and have sent them out into all the world. Now the comic poet, to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> laughter in the theatre, wrote that Jupiter, after awakening, dispatched Mercury to the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> and Laced&aelig;monians; but do not you think that you have made the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> more ridiculous in sending Him to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</q> Observe in such language as this the irreverent character of Celsus, who, unlike a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, takes the writer of a comedy, whose business is to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> laughter, and compares our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of all things, to the being who, as represented in the play, on awaking, dispatches Mercury (on an errand)! We stated, indeed, in what precedes, that it was not as if awakening from a lengthened slumber that God sent Jesus to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, who has now, for good reasons, fulfilled the economy of His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, but who has always conferred benefits upon the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. For no noble deed has ever been performed among men, where the divine Word did not visit the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those who were capable, although for a little time, of admitting such operations of the divine Word. Moreover, the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> apparently to one corner (of the earth) was founded on good reasons, since it was necessary that He who was the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> should make His appearance among those who had become acquainted with the doctrine of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who perused the writings of His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and who had come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the announcement of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that He should come to them at a time when the Word was about to be diffused from one corner over the whole world.</p>

<h2>Chapter 79</h2>

<p>And therefore there was no need that there should everywhere exist many bodies, and many spirits like Jesus, in order that the whole world of men might be enlightened by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. For the one Word was enough, having arisen as the <q>Sun of righteousness,</q> to send forth from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> His coming rays into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of all who were willing to receive Him. But if any one desires to see many bodies filled with a divine Spirit, similar to the one Christ, ministering to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men everywhere, let him take note of those who teach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in all lands in soundness of doctrine and uprightness of life, and who are themselves termed <q>christs</q> by the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, in the passage, <q>Touch not Mine anointed,  and do not My <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> any harm.</q>  For as we have heard that <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> comes, and yet have learned that there are many antichrists in the world, in the same way, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that Christ has come, we see that, owing to Him, there are many christs in the world, who, like Him, have loved righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity, and therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, anointed them also with the <q>oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>.</q> But inasmuch as He loved righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity above those who were His partners,  He also obtained the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of His anointing, and, if we must so term it, the entire unction of the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>; while they who were His partners shared also in His unction, in proportion to their individual capacity. Therefore, since Christ is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> form one body, the ointment descended from the head to the beard of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of the perfect man&mdash;and this ointment in its descent reached to the very skirt of his garment. This is my answer to the irreverent language of Celsus when he says, <q>He ought to have breathed (His Spirit) alike into many bodies, and have sent it forth into all the world.</q> The comic poet, indeed, to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> laughter, has represented Jupiter asleep and awaking from slumber, and dispatching Mercury to the Greeks; but the Word, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God is unaffected by sleep, may teach us that God administers in due season, and as right reason demands, the affairs of the world. It is not, however, a matter of surprise that, owing to the greatness and incomprehensibility  of the divine judgments, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should make mistakes, and Celsus among them. There is therefore nothing ridiculous in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> having been sent to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, among whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had appeared, in order that, making a commencement among them in a bodily shape, He might arise with might and power upon a world of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which no longer desired to remain deserted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 80</h2>

<p>After this, it seemed proper to Celsus to term the Chaldeans a most divinely-inspired nation from the very earliest times,  from whom the delusive system of <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>  has spread abroad among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Nay, he ranks the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> also in the same category, from whom the art of magic derived its name and has been transmitted to other nations, to the corruption and destruction of those who employ it. In the preceding part of this work, (we mentioned) that, in the opinion even of Celsus, the Egyptians also were guilty of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, because they had indeed solemn enclosures around what they considered their temples, while within them there was nothing save apes, or crocodiles, or goats, or asps, or some other animal; but on the present occasion it pleases him to speak of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> people too as most divinely inspired, and that, too, from the earliest times&mdash;perhaps because they made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from an early date. The Persians, moreover, who marry their own mothers,  and have intercourse with their own daughters, are, in the opinion of Celsus, an inspired race; nay, even the Indians are so, some of whom, in the preceding, he mentioned as eaters of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh. To the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, however, especially those of ancient times, who employ none of these practices, he did not merely refuse the name of inspired, but declared that they would immediately perish. And this prediction he uttered respecting them, as being doubtless endued with prophetic power, not observing that the whole history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and their ancient and venerable polity, were administered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that it is by their fall that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> has come to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and that <q>their fall is the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q>  until the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> come, that after that the whole of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, whom Celsus does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, may be saved.</p>

<h2>Chapter 81</h2>

<p>I do not understand, however, how he should say of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that although <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all things, He was not aware of this, that He was sending His Son among <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, who were both to be guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and to inflict punishment upon Him.</q> Certainly he appears, in the present instance, to have forgotten that all the sufferings which Jesus was to undergo were foreseen by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and foretold by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; from which it does not follow that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He was sending His Son among <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and sinful men, who were also to inflict punishment upon Him.</q> He immediately adds, however, that <q>our defence on this point is that all these things were predicted.</q> But as our sixth book has now attained sufficient dimensions, we shall stop here, and begin, God willing, the argument of the seventh, in which we shall consider the reasons which he thinks furnish an answer to our statement, that everything regarding Jesus was foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and as these are numerous, and require to be answered at length, we wished neither to cut the subject short, in consequence of the size of the present book, nor, in order to avoid doing so, to swell this sixth book beyond its proper proportions.</p>
