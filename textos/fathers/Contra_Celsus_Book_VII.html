<h1>Contra Celsus, Book VII</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>In the six former books we have endeavoured, reverend brother Ambrosius, according to our ability to meet the charges brought by Celsus against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and have as far as possible passed over nothing without first subjecting it to a full and close examination. And now, while we enter upon the seventh book, we call upon God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom Celsus accuses, that He who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of God would shed light into our hearts and scatter the darkness of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, in accordance with that saying of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> which we now offer as our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Destroy them by Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  For it is evidently the words and reasonings opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that God destroys by His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; so that when these are destroyed, all who are delivered from deception may go on with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to say, <q>I will freely <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> unto You,</q>  and may offer to the Most High a reasonable and smokeless <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>Celsus now sets himself to combat the views of those who say that the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold events which happened in the life of Christ Jesus. At the outset let us refer to a notion he has, that those who assume the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of another God besides the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have no ground on which to answer his objections; while we who recognise the same God rely for our defence on the prophecies which were delivered concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. His words are: <q>Let us see how they can raise a defence. To those who admit another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no defence is possible; and they who recognise the same God will always fall back upon the same reason, 'This and that must have happened.' And why? 'Because it had been predicted long before.'</q> To this we answer, that the arguments recently raised by Celsus against Jesus and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were so utterly feeble, that they might easily be overthrown even by those who are impious enough to bring in another God. Indeed, were it not dangerous to give to the weak any excuse for embracing false notions, we could furnish the answer ourselves, and show Celsus how unfounded is his opinion, that those who admit another God are not in a position to meet his arguments. However, let us for the present confine ourselves to a defence of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, in continuation of what we have said on the subject before.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Celsus goes on to say of us: <q>They set no value on the oracles of the Pythian priestess, of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Dodona, of Clarus, of Branchid&aelig;, of Jupiter Ammon, and of a multitude of others; although under their guidance we may say that colonies were sent forth, and the whole world peopled. But those sayings which were uttered or not uttered in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, after the manner of that country, as indeed they are still delivered among the people of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a> and Palestine&mdash; these they look upon as marvellous sayings, and unchangeably <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q> In regard to the oracles here enumerated, we reply that it would be possible for us to gather from the writings of Aristotle and the Peripatetic school not a few things to overthrow the authority of the Pythian and the other oracles. From <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> also, and his followers, we could quote passages to show that even among the Greeks themselves there were some who utterly discredited the oracles which were recognised and admired throughout the whole of Greece. But let it be granted that the responses delivered by the Pythian and other oracles were not the utterances of false men who pretended to a divine inspiration; and let us see if, after all, we cannot convince any sincere inquirers that there is no necessity to attribute these oracular responses to any divinities, but that, on the other hand, they may be traced to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>&mdash; to spirits which are at enmity with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and which in this way wish to hinder the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from rising upwards, from following the path of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and from returning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in sincere <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. It is said of the Pythian priestess, whose oracle seems to have been the most celebrated, that when she sat down at the mouth of the Castalian cave, the prophetic Spirit of Apollo entered her private parts; and when she was filled with it, she gave utterance to responses which are regarded with awe as divine truths. Judge by this whether that spirit does not show its profane and impure nature, by choosing to enter the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the prophetess not through the more becoming medium of the bodily pores which are both open and invisible, but by means of what no modest man would ever see or speak of. And this occurs not once or twice, which would be more permissible, but as often as she was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to receive inspiration from Apollo. Moreover, it is not the part of a divine spirit to drive the prophetess into such a state of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> that she loses control of herself. For he who is under the influence of the Divine Spirit ought to be the first to receive the beneficial effects; and these ought not to be first enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who consult the oracle about the concerns of natural or civil life, or for purposes of temporal gain or interest; and, moreover, that should be the time of clearest perception, when a person is in close intercourse with the Deity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>Accordingly, we can show from an examination of the sacred Scriptures, that the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who were enlightened as far as was necessary for their prophetic work by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, were the first to enjoy the benefit of the inspiration; and by the contact&mdash; if I may so say&mdash; of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> they became clearer in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were filled with a brighter light. And the body no longer served as a hindrance to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life; for to that which we call <q>the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh</q> it was deadened. For we are persuaded that the Divine Spirit <q>mortifies the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the body,</q> and destroys that enmity against God which the carnal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> serve to excite. If, then, the Pythian priestess is beside herself when she prophesies, what spirit must that be which fills her mind and clouds her judgment with darkness, unless it be of the same order with those <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> which many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> cast out of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> possessed with them? And this, we may observe, they do without the use of any curious arts of magic, or incantations, but merely by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and simple adjurations which the plainest person can use. Because for the most part it is unlettered <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who perform this work; thus making manifest the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is in the word of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the despicable weakness of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, which, in order to be overcome and driven out of the bodies and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, do not require the power and wisdom of those who are mighty in argument, and most learned in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>Moreover, if it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not only among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but also by many others among the Greeks and Barbarians, that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lives and subsists after its separation from the body; and if reason supports the idea that pure <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which are not weighed down with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as with a weight of lead ascend on high to the region of purer and more ethereal bodies, leaving here below their grosser bodies along with their impurities; whereas <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are polluted and dragged down to the earth by their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so that they are unable even to breathe upwards, wander hither and there, at some times about sepulchres, where they appear as the apparitions of shadowy spirits, at others among other objects on the ground&mdash;if this is so, what are we to think of those spirits that are attached for entire ages, as I may say, to particular dwellings and places, whether by a sort of magical force or by their own natural <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? Are we not compelled by reason to set down as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> such spirits as employ the power of prophesying&mdash; a power in itself neither good nor bad&mdash; for the purpose of deceiving men, and thus turn them away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and from the purity of His service? It is moreover evident that this is their character, when we add that they delight in the blood of victims, and in the smoke odour of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and that they feed their bodies on these, and that they take pleasure in such haunts as these, as though they sought in them the sustenance of their lives; in this resembling those depraved men who despise the purity of a life apart from the senses, and who have no inclination except for the pleasures of the body, and for that earthly and bodily life in which these pleasures are found. If the Delphian Apollo were a god, as the Greeks suppose, would he not rather have chosen as his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> some wise man? Or if such an one was not to be found, then one who was endeavouring to become wise? How came he not to prefer a man to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> for the utterance of his prophesies? And if he preferred the latter sex, as though he could only find pleasure in the breast of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, why did he not choose among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> to interpret his will?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>But no; the Pythian, so much admired among the Greeks, judged no wise man, nay, no man at all, worthy of the divine possession, as they call it. And among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> he did not choose a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, or one recommended by her wisdom, or by her attainments in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; but he selects a common <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Perhaps the better class of men were too good to become the subjects of the inspiration. Besides, if he were a god, he should have employed his prophetic power as a bait, so to speak, with which he might draw men to a change of life, and to the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But history nowhere makes mention of anything of the kind. For if the oracle did call Socrates the wisest of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, it takes from the value of that eulogy by what is said in regard to Euripides and Sophocles. The words are:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p>Sophocles is wise, and Euripides is wiser,
<br>But wiser than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is Socrates. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>As, then, he gives the designation <q>wise</q> to the tragic poets, it is not on account of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> that he holds up Socrates to veneration, or because of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. It is poor praise of Socrates to say that he prefers him to men who for a paltry reward compete upon the stage, and who by their representations excite the spectators at one time to tears and grief, and at another to unseemly laughter (for such is the intention of the satyric drama). And perhaps it was not so much in regard to his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> that he called Socrates the wisest of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as on account of the victims which he <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to him and the other <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For it seems that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> pay more regard in distributing their favours to the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which are offered them than to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Accordingly, Homer, the best of the poets, who describes what usually took place, when, wishing to show us what most influenced the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to grant an answer to the wishes of their votaries, introduces Chryses, who, for a few garlands and the thighs of bulls and goats, obtained an answer to his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for his daughter Chryseis, so that the Greeks were driven by a pestilence to restore her back to him. And I remember reading in the book of a certain <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a>, when writing on the hidden meanings in that poet, that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Chryses to Apollo, and the plague which Apollo afterwards sent upon the Greeks, are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that Homer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who delight in the smoke of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and who, to reward those who offer them, grant in answer to their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the destruction of others. <q>He,</q> that is, Jupiter, <q>who rules over wintry Dodona, where his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have ever unwashed feet, and sleep upon the ground,</q>  has rejected the male sex, and, as Celsus observes, employs the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of Dodona for the prophetic office. Granting that there are oracles similar to these, as that at Clarus, another in Branchid&aelig;, another in the temple of Jupiter Ammon, or anywhere else; yet how shall it be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that these are gods, and not <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>In regard to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, some of them were wise men before they became divinely inspired <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, while others became wise by the illumination which their minds received when divinely inspired. They were selected by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> to receive the Divine Spirit, and to be the depositaries of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oracles, on the ground of their leading a life of almost unapproachable excellence, intrepid, noble, unmoved by danger or death. For reason teaches that such ought to be the character of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the Most High, in comparison with which the firmness of Antisthenes, Crates, and Diogenes will seem but as child's play. It was therefore for their firm adherence to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and their faithfulness in the reproof of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, that <q>they were <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>; they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; they wandered in deserts and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth, of whom the world was not worthy:</q>  for they looked always to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to His blessings, which, being invisible, and not to be perceived by the senses, are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. We have the history of the life of each of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; but it will be enough at present to direct attention to the life of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, whose prophecies are contained in the law; to that of Jeremiah, as it is given in the book which bears his name; to that of Isaiah, who with unexampled austerity walked naked and barefooted for the space of three years.  Read and consider the severe life of those children, Daniel and his companions, how they abstained from flesh, and lived on water and pulse.  Or if you will go back to more remote times, think of the life of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, who prophesied;  and of Isaac, who gave his son a prophetic blessing; or of Jacob, who addressed each of his twelve sons, beginning with <q>Come, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last days.</q>  These, and a multitude of others, prophesying on behalf of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, foretold events relating to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. We therefore for this reason set at nought the oracles of the Pythian priestess, or those delivered at Dodona, at Clarus, at Branchid&aelig;, at the temple of Jupiter Ammon, or by a multitude of other so-called <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; while we regard with reverent awe the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: for we see that the noble, earnest, and devout lives of these men were worthy of the inspiration of the Divine Spirit, whose wonderful effects were widely different from the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what led Celsus, when saying, <q>But what things were spoken or not spoken in the land of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, according to the custom of the country,</q> to use the words <q>or not spoken,</q> as though implying that he was incredulous, and that he suspected that those things which were written were never spoken. In fact, he is unacquainted with these times; and he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that those <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who foretold the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, predicted a multitude of other events many years beforehand. He adds, with the view of casting a slight upon the ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that <q>they prophesied in the same way as we find them still doing among the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a> and Palestine.</q> But he does not tell us whether he refers to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are of different principles from those of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whose prophecies are of the same character as those of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. However it be, his statement is false, taken in either way. For never have any of those who have not embraced our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> done any thing approaching to what was done by the ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and in more recent times, since the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have arisen among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who have confessedly been abandoned by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> on account of their impiety towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and towards Him of whom their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> spoke. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> gave signs of His presence at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> ministry, and after His ascension He gave still more; but since that time these signs have diminished, although there are still traces of His presence in a few who have had their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> purified by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and their actions regulated by its influence. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note044693"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse5">Wisdom&nbsp;1:5</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>But as Celsus promises to give an account of the manner in which prophecies are delivered in <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a> and Palestine, speaking as though it were a matter with which he had a full and personal acquaintance, let us see what he has to say on the subject. First he lays it down that there are several kinds of prophecies, but he does not specify what they are; indeed, he could not do so, and the statement is a piece of pure ostentation. However, let us see what he considers the most perfect kind of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> among these nations. <q>There are many,</q> he says, <q>who, although of no name, with the greatest facility and on the slightest occasion, whether within or without temples, assume the motions and gestures of inspired <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; while others do it in cities or among armies, for the purpose of attracting attention and exciting surprise. These are accustomed to say, each for himself, 'I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; or, I am the Divine Spirit; I have come because the world is perishing, and you, O men, are perishing for your iniquities. But I wish to save you, and you shall see me returning again with heavenly power. Blessed is he who now does me homage. On all the rest I will send down <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, both on cities and on countries. And those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the punishments which await them shall repent and grieve in vain; while those who are faithful to me I will preserve <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.'</q> Then he goes on to say: <q>To these promises are added strange, fanatical, and quite unintelligible words, of which no rational person can find the meaning: for so dark are they, as to have no meaning at all; but they give occasion to every fool or <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> to apply them to suit his own purposes.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>But if he were dealing honestly in his accusations, he ought to have given the exact terms of the prophecies, whether those in which the speaker is introduced as claiming to be God Almighty, or those in which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> speaks, or finally those under the name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For thus he might have endeavoured to overthrow these assertions, and have shown that there was no divine inspiration in those words which urged men to forsake their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which condemned the past and foretold the future. For the prophecies were recorded and preserved by men living at the time, that those who came after might read and admire them as the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that they might profit not only by the warnings and admonitions, but also by the predictions, which, being shown by events to have proceeded from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, bind men to the practice of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> as set forth in the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have therefore, as God commanded them, declared with all plainness those things which it was desirable that the hearers should understand at once for the regulation of their conduct; while in regard to deeper and more <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> subjects, which lay beyond the reach of the common understanding, they set them forth in the form of enigmas and allegories, or of what are called dark sayings, <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, or similitudes. And this plan they have followed, that those who are ready to shun no labour and spare no pains in their endeavours after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> might search into their meaning, and having found it, might apply it as reason requires. But Celsus, ever vigorous in his denunciations, as though he were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at his inability to understand the language of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, scoffs at them thus: <q>To these grand promises are added strange, fanatical, and quite unintelligible words, of which no rational person can find the meaning; for so dark are they as to have no meaning at all; but they give occasion to every fool or <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> to apply them so as to suit his own purposes.</q> This statement of Celsus seems ingeniously designed to dissuade readers from attempting any inquiry or careful search into their meaning. And in this he is not unlike certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who said to a man whom a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had visited to announce future events, <q>Wherefore came this mad fellow to you?</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>I am convinced, indeed, that much better arguments could be adduced than any I have been able to bring forward, to show the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of these allegations of Celsus, and to set forth the divine inspiration of the prophecies; but we have according to our ability, in our commentaries on Isaiah, Ezekiel, and some of the twelve minor <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, explained literally and in detail what he calls <q>those fanatical and utterly unintelligible passages.</q>  And if God give us <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the time that He appoints for us, to advance in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His word, we shall continue our investigation into the parts which remain, or into such at least as we are able to make plain. And other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of intelligence who wish to study Scripture may also find out its meaning for themselves; for although there are many places in which the meaning is not obvious, yet there are none where, as Celsus affirms, <q>there is no sense at all.</q> Neither is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <q>any fool or <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> can explain the passages so as to make them suit his own purposes.</q> For it belongs only to those who are wise in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Christ (and to all them it does belong) to unfold the connection and meaning of even the obscure parts of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, <q>comparing spiritual things with spiritual,</q> and interpreting each passage according to the usage of Scripture writers. And Celsus is not to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> when he says that he has heard such men prophesy; for no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> bearing any resemblance to the ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have appeared in the time of Celsus. If there had been any, those who heard and admired them would have followed the example of the ancients, and have recorded the prophecies in writing. And it seems quite clear that Celsus is speaking <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, when he says that <q>those <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> whom he had heard, on being pressed by him, confessed their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> motives, and acknowledged that the ambiguous words they used really meant nothing.</q> He ought to have given the names of those whom he says he had heard, if he had any to give, so that those who were competent to judge might decide whether his allegations were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or false.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>He thinks, besides, that those who support the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Christ by a reference to the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> can give no proper answer in regard to statements in them which attribute to God that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, shameful, or impure; and assuming that no answer can be given, he proceeds to draw a whole train of inferences, none of which can be allowed. But he ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that those who wish to live according to the teaching of sacred Scripture understand the saying, <q>The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the unwise is as talk without sense,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note044696"><a href="../bible/sir021.htm#verse18">Sirach&nbsp;21:18</a></span> and have learned <q>to be ready always to give an answer to every one that asks us a reason for the hope that is in us.</q>  And they are not satisfied with affirming that such and such things have been predicted; but they endeavour to remove any apparent inconsistencies, and to show that, so far from there being anything <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, shameful, or impure in these predictions, everything is worthy of being received by those who understand the sacred Scriptures. But Celsus ought to have adduced from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> examples of what he thought bad, or shameful, or impure, if he saw any such passages; for then his argument would have had much more force, and would have furthered his purpose much better. He gives no instances, however, but contents himself with loudly asserting the false charge that these things are to be found in Scripture. There is no reason, then, for us to defend ourselves against groundless charges, which are but empty sounds, or to take the trouble of showing that in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> there is nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, shameful, impure, or abominable.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>And there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the statement of Celsus, that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does the most shameless <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, or suffers the most shameless sufferings,</q> or that <q>He favours the commission of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;</q> for whatever he may say, no such things have ever been foretold. He ought to have cited from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> the passages in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is represented as favouring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or as doing and enduring the most shameless <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and not to have sought without foundation to prejudice the minds of his readers. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, indeed, foretold what Christ should suffer, and set forth the reason why He should suffer. God therefore also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what Christ would suffer; but where has he learned that those things which the Christ of God should suffer were most base and dishonourable? He goes on to explain what those most shameful and degrading things were which Christ suffered, in these words: <q>For what better was it for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to eat the flesh of sheep, or to drink vinegar and gall, than to feed on filth?</q> But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to us, did not eat the flesh of sheep; and while it may seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> ate, He did so only as possessing a body. But in regard to the vinegar and gall mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, <q>They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink,</q>  we have already referred  to this point; and as Celsus compels us to recur to it again, we would only say further, that those who resist the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> do ever offer to Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> the gall of their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and the vinegar of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> inclinations; but though He tastes of it, yet He will not drink it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>In the next place, wishing to shake the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Jesus on the ground of the prophecies which were delivered in regard to Him, Celsus says: <q>But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold that the great God&mdash; not to put it more harshly&mdash; would become a slave, or become sick or die; would there be therefore any necessity that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should die, or suffer sickness, or become a slave, simply because such things had been foretold? Must he die in order to prove his divinity? But the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> never would utter predictions so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and impious. We need not therefore inquire whether a thing has been predicted or not, but whether the thing is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> in itself, and worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and base, although it seemed that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the world had foretold it in a fit of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, we must not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. How then can the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mind admit that those things which are said to have happened to him, could have happened to one who is God?</q> From this it is plain that Celsus feels the argument from <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> to be very effective for convincing those to whom Christ is preached; but he seems to endeavour to overthrow it by an opposite probability, namely, <q>that the question is not whether the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> uttered these predictions or not.</q> But if he wished to reason <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and without evasion, he ought rather to have said, <q>We must show that these things were never predicted, or that those things which were predicted of Christ have never been fulfilled in him,</q> and in that way he would have established the position which he holds. In that way it would have been made plain what those prophecies are which we apply to Jesus, and how Celsus could justify himself in asserting that that application was false. And we should thus have seen whether he fairly disproved all that we bring from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in behalf of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, or whether he himself is convicted of a shameless endeavour to resist the plainest truths by violent assertions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>After assuming that some things were foretold which are impossible in themselves, and inconsistent with the character of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he says: <q>If these things were predicted of the Most High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are we bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them of God simply because they were predicted?</q> And thus he thinks he proves, that although the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> may have foretold <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> such things of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, yet it is impossible for us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in those prophecies declaring that He would do or suffer such things. To this our answer is that the supposition is absurd, for it combines two lines of reasoning which are opposed to each other, and therefore mutually destructive. This may be shown as follows. The one argument is: <q>If any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the Most High say that God will become a slave, or suffer sickness, or die, these things will come to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it is impossible that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the great God should utter lies.</q> The other is: <q>If even <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the Most High God say that these same things shall come to pass, seeing that these things foretold are by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things impossible, the prophecies are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and therefore those things which have been foretold will not happen to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> When, then, we find two processes of reasoning in both of which the major premiss is the same, leading to two contradictory conclusions, we use the form of argument called <q>the theorem of two propositions,</q>  to prove that the major premiss is false, which in the case before us is this, <q>that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have foretold that the great God should become a slave, suffer sickness, or die.</q> We conclude, then, that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> never foretold such things; and the argument is formally expressed as follows: 1st, Of two things, if the first is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the second is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; 2d, if the first is  <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the second is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, therefore the first is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The concrete example which the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> give to illustrate this form of argument is the following: 1st, If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are dead, you are dead; 2d, if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are dead, you are not dead. And the conclusion is&mdash; <q>you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are dead.</q> These propositions are worked out as follows: If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are dead, that which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is certain; therefore you are dead. Again, if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are dead, your death is an object of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; but as the dead <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing, your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this proves that you are not dead. Accordingly, by joining the two arguments together, you arrive at the conclusion&mdash; <q>you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are dead.</q> Now the hypothesis of Celsus which we have given above is much of the same kind.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p>But besides, the prophecies which he introduces into his argument are very different from what the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> actually foretold of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. For the prophecies do not foretell that God will be crucified, when they say of Him who should suffer, <q>We beheld Him, and He had no form or comeliness; but His form was dishonoured and marred more than the sons of men; He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.</q>  Observe, then, how distinctly they say that it was a man who should endure these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sufferings. And Jesus Himself, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> perfectly that one who was to die must be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, said to His accusers: <q>But now you seek to kill Me, a man that has spoken unto you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which I heard of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And if in that man as He appeared among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> there was something divine, namely the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of all creation, one who said of Himself, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> <q>I am the life,</q> <q>I am the door,</q> <q>I am the way,</q> <q>I am the living bread which came down from heaven,</q> of this Being and His nature we must judge and reason in a way quite different from that in which we judge of the man who was seen in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Accordingly, you will find no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, however simple he may be, and however little versed in critical studies, who would say that He who died was <q>the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> <q>the life,</q> <q>the way,</q> <q>the living bread which came down from heaven,</q> <q>the resurrection;</q> for it was He who appeared to us in the form of the man Jesus, who taught us, saying, <q>I am the resurrection.</q> There is no one among us, I say, so extravagant as to affirm <q>the Life died,</q> <q>the Resurrection died.</q> The supposition of Celsus would have some foundation if we were to say that it had been foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that death would befall <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, the Truth, the Life, the Resurrection, or any other name which is assumed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>In one point alone is Celsus correct in his statements on this subject. It is that in which he says: <q>The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> would not foretell this, because it involves that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and impious,</q>&mdash; namely, that the great God should become a slave or suffer death. But that which is predicted by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> is worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He who is the brightness and express image of the divine nature should come into the world with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which was to animate the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, to sow the seed of His word, which might bring all who received and cherished it into union with the Most High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which would lead to perfect blessedness all those who felt within them the power of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, who was to be in the body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. He was to be in it indeed, but not in such a way as to confine therein all the rays of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and we are not to suppose that the light of Him who is <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> is shed forth in no other way than in this. If, then, we consider Jesus in relation to the divinity that was in Him, the things which He did in this capacity present nothing to offend our ideas of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nothing but what is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; and if we consider Him as man, distinguished beyond all other men by an intimate communion with the Eternal Word, with absolute Wisdom, He suffered as one who was wise and perfect, whatever it behooved Him to suffer who did all for the good of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, yea, even for the good of all intelligent beings. And there is nothing absurd in a man having died, and in His death being not only an example of death endured for the sake of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, but also the first blow in the conflict which is to overthrow the power of that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who had obtained dominion over the whole world.  For we have signs and pledges of the destruction of his empire, in those who through the coming of Christ are everywhere escaping from the power of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and who, after their deliverance from this bondage in which they were held, consecrate themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and earnestly devote themselves day by day to advancement in a life of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p>Celsus adds: <q>Will they not besides make this reflection? If the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> foretold that he who should come into the world would be the Son of this same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how could he command them through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to gather <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, to extend their dominion, to fill the earth, to put their enemies of every age to the sword, and to destroy them utterly, which indeed he himself did&mdash; as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says&mdash; threatening them, moreover, that if they did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> his commands, he would treat them as his avowed enemies; while, on the other hand, his Son, the man of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, promulgated <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> quite opposed  to these, declaring that no one can come to the Father who loves power, or riches, or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; that men ought not to be more careful in providing food than the ravens; that they were to be less concerned about their raiment than the lilies; that to him who has given them one blow, they should offer to receive another? Whether is it <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> or Jesus who teaches <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>? Did the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when he sent Jesus, forget the commands which he had given to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? Or did he change his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, condemn his own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and send forth a messenger with counter instructions?</q> Celsus, with all his boasts of universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, has here fallen into the most vulgar of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, in supposing that in the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> there is not a meaning deeper than that afforded by a literal rendering of the words. He does not see how manifestly incredible it is that worldly riches should be promised to those who lead upright lives, when it is a matter of common observation that the best of men have lived in extreme poverty. Indeed, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> themselves, who for the purity of their lives received the Divine Spirit, <q>wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented: they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</q>  For, as the Psalmist, says, <q>many are the afflictions of the righteous.</q>  If Celsus had read the writings of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, he would, I daresay, have supposed that when it is said to him who kept the law, <q>You shall lend unto many nations, and you yourself shall not borrow,</q>  the promise is made to the just man, that his temporal riches should be so abundant, that he would be able to lend not only to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, not only to two or three nations, but <q>to many nations.</q> What, then, must have been the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which the just man received according to the law for his righteousness, if he could lend to many nations? And must we not suppose also, in accordance with this interpretation, that the just man would never borrow anything? For it is written, <q>and you shall yourself borrow nothing.</q> Did then that nation remain for so long a period attached to the religion which was taught by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, while, according to the supposition of Celsus, they saw themselves so grievously deceived by that lawgiver? For nowhere is it said of any one that he was so rich as to lend to many nations. It is not to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that they would have fought so <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> in defence of a law whose promises had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> glaringly false, if they understood them in the sense which Celsus gives to them. And if any one should say that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are recorded to have been committed by the people are a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that they despised the law, doubtless from the feeling that they had been deceived by it, we may reply that we have only to read the history of the times in order to find it shown that the whole people, after having done that which was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the Lord, returned afterwards to their duty, and to the religion prescribed by the law.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p>Now if these words in the law, <q>You shall have dominion over many nations, and no one shall rule over you,</q> were simply a promise to them of dominion, and if they contain no deeper meaning than this, then it is certain that the people would have had still stronger grounds for despising the promises of the law. Celsus brings forward another passage, although he changes the terms of it, where it is said that the whole earth shall be filled with the Hebrew race; which indeed, according to the testimony of history, did actually happen after the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although rather as a result of God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, if I may so say, than of His blessing. As to the promise made to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that they should slay their enemies, it may be answered that any one who examines carefully into the meaning of this passage will find himself unable to interpret it literally. It is sufficient at present to refer to the manner in which in the Psalms the just man is represented as saying, among other things, <q>Every morning will I destroy the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> of the land; that I may cut off all workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.</q>  Judge, then, from the words and spirit of the speaker, whether it is conceivable that, after having in the preceding part of the Psalm, as any one may read for himself, uttered the noblest thoughts and purposes, he should in the sequel, according to the literal rendering of his words, say that in the morning, and at no other period of the day, he would destroy all sinners from the earth, and leave none of them alive, and that he would slay every one in Jerusalem who did iniquity. And there are many similar expressions to be found in the law, as this, for example: <q>We left not anything alive.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p>Celsus adds, that it was foretold to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that if they did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the law, they would be treated in the same way as they treated their enemies; and then he quotes from the teaching of Christ some precepts which he considers contrary to those of the law, and uses that as an argument against us. But before proceeding to this point, we must speak of that which precedes. We hold, then, that the law has a twofold sense,&mdash; the one literal, the other spiritual,&mdash; as has been shown by some before us. Of the first or literal sense it is said, not by us, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, speaking in one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that <q>the statutes are not good, and the judgments not good;</q>  whereas, taken in a spiritual sense, the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> makes God say that <q>His statutes are good, and His judgments good.</q> Yet evidently the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is not saying things which are contradictory of each other. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in like manner says, that <q>the letter kills, and the spirit gives life,</q>  meaning by <q>the letter</q> the literal sense, and by <q>the spirit</q> the spiritual sense of Scripture. We may therefore find in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, as well as in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, apparent contradictions. Indeed, if Ezekiel says in one place, <q>I gave them commandments which were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live,</q> and in another, <q>I gave them good commandments and judgments, which if a man shall do, he shall live by them,</q>  <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in like manner, when he wishes to disparage the law taken literally, says, <q>If the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, so that the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> could not steadfastly behold the face of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his countenance, which <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>?</q>  But when in another place he wishes to praise and recommend the law, he calls it <q>spiritual,</q> and says, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the law is spiritual;</q> and, <q>Wherefore the law is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and the commandment <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and just, and good.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p>When, then, the letter of the law promises riches to the just, Celsus may follow the letter which kills, and understand it of worldly riches, which blind men; but we say that it refers to those riches which enlighten the eyes, and which enrich a man <q>in all utterance and in all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> And in this sense we <q>charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gives us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate.</q>  For, as Solomon says, <q>riches</q> are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> good, which <q>are the ransom of the life of a man;</q> but the poverty which is the opposite of these riches is destructive, for by it <q>the poor cannot bear rebuke.</q>  And what has been said of riches applies to dominion, in regard to which it is said, <q>The just man shall chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight.</q>  Now if riches are to be taken in the sense we have just explained, consider if it is not according to God's promise that he who is rich in all utterance, in all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in all wisdom, in all good works, may not out of these treasures of utterance, of wisdom, and of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, lend to many nations. It was thus that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> lent to all the nations that he visited, <q>carrying the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Christ from Jerusalem, and round about unto <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>.</q>  And as the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was given to him by revelation, and his mind was illumined by the Divine Word, he himself therefore needed to borrow from no one, and required not the ministry to any man to teach him the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Thus, as it had been written, <q>You shall have dominion over many nations, and they shall not have dominion over you,</q> he ruled over the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> whom he brought under the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; and he never <q>gave place by subjection to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, no, not for an hour,</q>  as being himself mightier than they. And thus also he <q>filled the earth.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p>If I must now explain how the just man <q>slays his enemies,</q> and prevails everywhere, it is to be observed that, when he says, <q>Every morning will I destroy the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> of the land, that I may cut off all workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah,</q> by <q>the land</q> he means the flesh whose <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> are at enmity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and by <q>the city of Jehovah</q> he designates his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in which was the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, containing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> idea and conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which makes it to be admired by all who look upon it. As soon, then, as the rays of the Sun of righteousness shine into his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, feeling strengthened and invigorated by their influence, he sets himself to destroy all the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh, which are called <q>the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> of the land,</q> and drives out of that city of the Lord which is in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> all thoughts which work iniquity, and all suggestions which are opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And in this way also the just give up to destruction all their enemies, which are their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, so that they do not spare even the children, that is, the early beginnings and promptings of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In this sense also we understand the language of the <a href="../bible/psa136.htm">137th Psalm</a>: <q>O daughter of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, who art to be destroyed; <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> shall he be that rewards you as you have served us: <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> shall he be that takes and dashes your little ones against the stones.</q>  For <q>the little ones</q> of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>  (which signifies confusion) are those troublesome sinful thoughts which arise in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and he who subdues them by striking, as it were, their heads against the firm and solid strength of reason and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is the man who <q>dashes the little ones against the stones;</q> and he is therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed. God may therefore have commanded men to destroy all their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> utterly, even at their birth, without having enjoined anything contrary to the teaching of Christ; and He may Himself have destroyed before the eyes of those who were <q><a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> inwardly</q>  all the offspring of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as His enemies. And, in like manner, those who disobey the law and word of God may well be compared to His enemies led astray by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and they may well be said to suffer the same <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> as they deserve who have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> traitors to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p>From what has been said, it is clear then that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <q>the man of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>,</q> did not promulgate <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> opposed to those just considered in regard to riches, when He said, <q>It is hard for the rich man to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>;</q>  whether we take the word <q>rich</q> in its simplest sense, as referring to the man whose mind is distracted by his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and, as it were, entangled with thorns, so that he brings forth no spiritual fruit; or whether it is the man who is rich in the sense of abounding in false notions, of whom it is written in the Proverbs, <q>Better is the poor man who is just, than the rich man who is false.</q>  Perhaps it is the following passages which have led Celsus to suppose that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> forbids ambition to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>Whoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all;</q>  <q>The princes of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> exercise dominion over them,</q>  and <q>they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.</q>  But there is nothing here inconsistent with the promise, <q>You shall rule over many nations, and they shall not rule over you,</q> especially after the explanation which we have given of these words. Celsus next throws in an expression in regard to wisdom, as though he thought that, according to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, no wise man could come to the Father. But we would ask in what sense he speaks of a wise man. For if he means one who is wise in <q>the wisdom of this world,</q> as it is called, <q>which is foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  then we would agree with him in saying that access to the Father is denied to one who is wise in that sense. But if by wisdom any one means Christ, who is <q>the power and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> far from such a wise man being refused access to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, we hold that he who is adorned by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> with that gift which is called <q>the word of wisdom,</q> far excels all those who have not received the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p>The pursuit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, we maintain, is forbidden not only by the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, but also by the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Accordingly we find one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when imprecating upon himself certain punishments for the commission of certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, includes among the punishments this one of earthly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. He says, <q>O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; if I have rewarded <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, rather, I have delivered him that without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is mine enemy;) let the enemy <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and <em>set my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> up on high</em>.</q>  And these precepts of our Lord, <q>Take no thought what you shall eat, or what you shall drink. Behold the fowls of the air, or behold the ravens: for they sow not, neither do they reap; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. How much better are you than they! And why do you take thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field;</q> &mdash; these precepts, and those which follow, are not inconsistent with the promised blessings of the law, which teaches that the just <q>shall eat their bread to the full;</q>  nor with that saying of Solomon, <q>The righteous eats to the satisfying of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the belly of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall want.</q>  For we must consider the food promised in the law as the food of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is to satisfy not both parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> nature, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> only. And the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, although probably containing a deeper meaning, may yet be taken in their more simple and obvious sense, as teaching us not to be disturbed with anxieties about our food and clothing, but, while living in plainness, and desiring only what is needful, to put our trust in the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p>Celsus then extracts from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the precept, <q>To him who strikes you once, you shall offer yourself to be struck again,</q> although without giving any passage from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> which he considers opposed to it. On the one hand, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <q>it was said to them in old time, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;</q>  and on the other, we have read, <q>I say unto you, Whoever shall smite you on the one cheek, turn to him the other also.</q>  But as there is reason to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Celsus produces the objections which he has heard from those who wish to make a difference between the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the law, we must say in reply, that this precept, <q>Whosoever shall strike you on the one cheek, turn to him the other,</q> is not unknown in the older Scriptures. For thus, in the Lamentations of Jeremiah, it is said, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth: he sits alone, and keeps silence, because he has borne it upon him. He gives his cheek to him that smites him; he is filled full with reproach.</q>  There is no discrepancy, then, between the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the law, even when we take literally the precept regarding the blow on the face. So, then, we infer that neither <q>Jesus nor <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> has taught <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>.</q> The Father in sending Jesus did not <q>forget the commands which He had given to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>:</q> He did not <q>change His <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, condemn His own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and send by His messenger counter instructions.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p>However, if we must refer briefly to the difference between the constitution which was given to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of old by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and that which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, under the direction of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching, wish now to establish, we would observe that it must be impossible for the legislation of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, taken literally, to harmonize with the calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and with their subjection to the Roman government; and on the other hand, it would be impossible for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to preserve their civil economy unchanged, supposing that they should embrace the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> could not slay their enemies, or condemn to be burned or <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commands, those who had broken the law, and were therefore condemned as deserving of these punishments; since the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves, however desirous of carrying out their law, are not able to inflict these punishments. But in the case of the ancient <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who had a land and a form of government of their own, to take from them the right of making <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon their enemies, of fighting for their country, of putting to death or otherwise punishing adulterers, murderers, or others who were guilty of similar crimes, would be to subject them to sudden and utter destruction whenever the enemy fell upon them; for their very <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> would in that case restrain them, and prevent them from resisting the enemy. And that same <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> which of old gave the law, and has now given the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, not wishing the Jewish state to continue longer, has destroyed their city and their temple: it has abolished the worship which was offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in that temple by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of victims, and other ceremonies which He had prescribed. And as it has destroyed these things, not wishing that they should longer continue, in like manner it has extended day by day the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, so that it is now preached everywhere with boldness, and that in spite of the numerous obstacles which oppose the spread of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching in the world. But since it was the purpose of God that the nations should receive the benefits of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching, all the devices of men against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> have been brought to nought; for the more that kings, and rulers, and peoples have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> them everywhere, the more have they increased in number and grown in strength.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

<p>After this Celsus relates at length opinions which he ascribes to us, but which we do not hold, regarding the Divine Being, to the effect that <q>he is corporeal in his nature, and possesses a body like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> As he undertakes to refute opinions which are none of ours, it would be needless to give either the opinions themselves or their refutation. Indeed, if we did hold those views of God which he ascribes to us, and which he opposes, we would be bound to quote his words, to adduce our own arguments, and to refute his. But if he brings forward opinions which he has either heard from no one, or if it be assumed that he has heard them, it must have been from those who are very simple and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the meaning of Scripture, then we need not undertake so superfluous a task as that of refuting them. For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> plainly speak of God as of a being without body. Hence it is said, <q>No man has seen God at any time;</q>  and the First-born of all creation is called <q>the image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  which is the same as if it were said that He is incorporeal. However, we have already said something on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God while examining into the meaning of the words, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a Spirit, and they who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<p>After thus misrepresenting our views of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Celsus goes on to ask of us <q>where we hope to go after death;</q> and he makes our answer to be, <q>to another land better than this.</q> On this he comments as follows: <q>The divine men of a former age have spoken of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life reserved for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed. Some designated it 'the isles of the blest,' and others 'the Elysian plain,' so called because they were there to be delivered from their present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Thus Homer says: 'But the gods shall send you to the Elysian plain, on the borders of the earth, where they lead a most quiet life.'  <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> also, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, distinctly gives the name 'land' to the place where it is sent. 'The extent of it,'  says he, 'is immense, and we only occupy a small portion of it, from the Phasis to the Pillars of Hercules, where we dwell along the shores of the sea, as grasshoppers and frogs beside a marsh. But there are many other places inhabited in like manner by other men. For there are in different parts of the earth cavities, varying in form and in magnitude, into which run water, and clouds, and air. But that land which is pure lies in the pure region of heaven.'</q> Celsus therefore supposes that what we say of a land which is much better and more excellent than this, has been borrowed from certain ancient writers whom he styles <q>divine,</q> and chiefly from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who in his <em>Ph&aelig;don</em> discourses on the pure land lying in a pure heaven. But he does not see that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who is much older than the Greek literature, introduces God as promising to those who lived according to His law the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> land, which is <q>a good land and a large, a land flowing with milk and honey;</q>  which promise is not to be understood to refer, as some suppose, to that part of the earth which we call <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>; for it, however good it may be, still forms part of the earth, which was originally cursed for the transgression of Adam. For these words, <q>Cursed shall the ground be for what you have done; with grief, that is, with labour, shall you eat of the fruit of it all the days of your life,</q>  were spoken of the whole earth, the fruit of which every man who died in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> eats with sorrow or labour all the days of his life. And as all the earth has been cursed, it brings forth thorns and briers all the days of the life of those who in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> were driven out of paradise; and in the sweat of his face every man eats bread until he returns to the ground from which he was taken. For the full exposition of all that is contained in this passage much might be said; but we have confined ourselves to these few words at present, which are intended to remove the idea, that what is said of the good land promised by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the righteous, refers to the land of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>

<p>If, then, the whole earth has been cursed in the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and of those who died in him, it is plain that all parts of the earth share in the curse, and among others the land of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>; so that the words, a good land and a large, a land flowing with milk and honey, cannot apply to it, although we may say of it, that both <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and Jerusalem were the shadow and figure of that pure land, goodly and large, in the pure region of heaven, in which is the heavenly Jerusalem. And it is in reference to this Jerusalem that the apostle spoke, as one who, <q>being risen with Christ, and seeking those things which are above,</q> had found a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which formed no part of the Jewish mythology. <q>You have come,</q> says he, <q>unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q>  And in order to be assured that our explanation of <q>the good and large land</q> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is not contrary to the intention of the Divine Spirit, we have only to read in all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> what they say of those who, after having left Jerusalem, and wandered astray from it, should afterwards return and be settled in the place which is called the habitation and city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in the words, <q>His dwelling is in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place;</q>  and, <q>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the mountain of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, beautiful for situation, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the whole earth.</q>  It is enough at present to quote the words of the <a href="../bible/psa036.htm">thirty-seventh Psalm</a>, which speaks thus of the land of the righteous, <q>Those that wait upon the Lord they shall inherit the earth;</q> and a little after, <q>But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace;</q> and again, <q>Those who bless Him shall inherit the earth;</q> and, <q>The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.</q>  And consider whether it is not evident to intelligent readers that the following words from this same Psalm refer to the pure land in the pure heaven: <q>Wait on the Lord, and keep His way; and He shall exalt you to inherit the land.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>

<p>It seems to me also that the fancy of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, that those stones which we call precious stones derive their lustre from a reflection, as it were, of the stones in that better land, is taken from the words of Isaiah in describing the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>I will make your battlements of jasper, your stones shall be crystal, and your borders of precious stones;</q>  and, <q>I will lay your foundations with sapphires.</q> Those who hold in greatest reverence the teaching of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, explain this myth of his as an allegory. And the prophecies from which, as we conjecture, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> has borrowed, will be explained by those who, leading a godly life like that of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, devote all their time to the study of the sacred Scriptures, to those who are qualified to learn by purity of life, and their desire to advance in divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For our part, our purpose has been simply to say that what we affirm of that sacred land has not been taken from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> or any of the Greeks, but that they rather&mdash; living as they did not only after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who was the oldest, but even after most of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; borrowed from them, and in so doing either misunderstood their obscure intimations on such subjects, or else endeavoured, in their allusions to the better land, to imitate those portions of Scripture which had fallen into their hands. Haggai expressly makes a distinction between the earth and the dry land, meaning by the latter the land in which we live. He says: <q>Yet once, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the dry land, and the sea.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>

<p>Referring to the passage in the <em>Ph&aelig;don</em> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, Celsus says: <q>It is not easy for every one to understand the meaning of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> words, when he says that on account of our weakness and slowness we are unable to reach the highest region of the air; but that if our nature were capable of so sublime a <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, we would then be able to understand that that is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heaven, and that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light.</q> As Celsus has deferred to another opportunity the explanation of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> idea, we also think that it does not fall within our purpose at present to enter into any full description of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and good land, and of the city of God which is in it; but reserve the consideration of it for our Commentary on the Prophets, having already in part, according to our power, treated of the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in our remarks on <a href="../bible/psa046.htm">Psalm 46</a> and <a href="../bible/psa048.htm">Psalm 48</a>. The writings of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; the most ancient of all books&mdash; teach us that all things here on earth which are in common use among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, have other things corresponding to them in name which are alone real. Thus, for instance, there is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, and another heaven beyond the firmament, and a Sun of righteousness other than the sun we see. In a word, to distinguish those things from the objects of sense, which have no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reality, they say of God that <q>His works are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;</q>  thus making a distinction between the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the works of God's hands, which latter are of an inferior sort. Accordingly, God in Isaiah complains of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that <q>they regard not the works of the Lord, nor consider the operation of His hands.</q>  But enough on this point.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>

<p>Celsus next assails the doctrine of the resurrection, which is a high and difficult doctrine, and one which more than others requires a high and advanced degree of wisdom to set forth how worthy it is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and how sublime a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it is which teaches us that there is a seminal principle lodged in that which Scripture speaks of as the <q>tabernacle</q> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in which the righteous <q>do groan, being burdened, not for that they would be unclothed, but clothed upon.</q>  Celsus ridicules this doctrine because he does not understand it, and because he has learned it from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who were unable to support it on any reasonable grounds. It will be profitable, therefore, that in addition to what we have said above, we should make this one remark. Our teaching on the subject of the resurrection is not, as Celsus imagines, derived from anything that we have heard on the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a>; but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is immaterial and invisible in its nature, exists in no material place, without having a body suited to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that place. Accordingly, it at one time puts off one body which was necessary before, but which is no longer adequate in its changed state, and it exchanges it for a second; and at another time it assumes another in addition to the former, which is needed as a better covering, suited to the purer ethereal regions of heaven. When it comes into the world at birth, it casts off the integuments which it needed in the womb; and before doing this, it puts on another body suited for its life upon earth. Then, again, as there is <q>a tabernacle</q> and <q>an earthly house</q> which is in some sort necessary for this tabernacle, Scripture teaches us that <q>the earthly house of this tabernacle shall be dissolved,</q> but that the tabernacle shall <q>be clothed upon with a house not made with hands, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in the heavens.</q>  The men of God say also that <q>the corruptible shall put on incorruption,</q>  which is a different thing from <q>the incorruptible;</q> and <q>the mortal shall put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>,</q> which is different from <q>the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.</q> Indeed, what <q>wisdom</q> is to <q>the wise,</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a></q> to <q>the just,</q> and <q>peace</q> to <q>the peaceable,</q> the same relation does <q>incorruption</q> hold to <q>the incorruptible,</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a></q> to <q>the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.</q> Behold, then, to what a prospect Scripture encourages us to look, when it speaks to us of being clothed with incorruption and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, which are, as it were, vestments which will not suffer those who are covered with them to come to corruption or death. Thus far I have taken the liberty of referring to this subject, in answer to one who assails the doctrine of the resurrection without understanding it, and who, simply because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing about it, made it the object of contempt and ridicule.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33</h2>

<p>As Celsus supposes that we uphold the doctrine of the resurrection in order that we may see and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he thus follows out his notions on the subject: <q>After they have been utterly refuted and vanquished, they still, as if regardless of all objections, come back again to the same question, 'How then shall we see and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God? How shall we go to Him?'</q> Let any, however, who are disposed to hear us observe, that if we have need of a body for other purposes, as for occupying a material locality to which this body must be adapted, and if on that account the <q>tabernacle</q> is clothed in the way we have shown, we have no need of a body in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God. For that which sees God is not the eye of the body; it is the mind which is made in the image of the Creator,  and which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has in His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> rendered capable of that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. To see God belongs to the pure heart, out of which no longer proceed <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> eye,</q>  or any other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing. Wherefore it is said, <q>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</q>  But as the strength of our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not sufficient to procure the perfectly pure heart, and as we need that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should create it, he therefore who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> as he ought, offers this petition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Create in me a clean heart, O God.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>

<p>And we do not ask the question, <q>How shall we go to God?</q> as though we thought that God <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in some place. God is of too excellent a nature for any place: He holds all things in His power, and is Himself not confined by anything whatever. The precept, therefore, <q>You shall walk after the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  does not command a bodily approach to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; neither does the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> refer to physical nearness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he says in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> follows hard after You.</q>  Celsus therefore misrepresents us, when he says that we expect to see God with our bodily eyes, to hear Him with our ears, and to touch Him sensibly with our hands. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> make mention of eyes, of ears, and of hands, which have nothing but the name in common with the bodily organs; and what is more wonderful, they speak of a diviner sense, which is very different from the senses as commonly spoken of. For when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law,</q>  or, <q>the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes,</q>  or, <q>Lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,</q>  no one is so foolish as to suppose that the eyes of the body behold the wonders of the divine law, or that the law of the Lord gives light to the bodily eyes, or that the sleep of death falls on the eyes of the body. When our Saviour says, <q>He that has ears to hear, let him hear,</q>  any one will understand that the ears spoken of are of a diviner kind. When it is said that the word of the Lord was <q>in the hand</q> of Jeremiah or of some other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; or when the expression is used, <q>the law by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,</q> or, <q>I sought the Lord with my hands, and was not deceived,</q> &mdash; no one is so foolish as not to see that the word <q>hands</q> is taken figuratively, as when John says, <q>Our hands have handled the Word of life.</q>  And if you wish further to learn from the sacred writings that there is a diviner sense than the senses of the body, you have only to hear what Solomon says, <q>You shall find a divine sense.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 35</h2>

<p>Seeking <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, in this way, we have no need to visit the oracles of Trophonius, of Amphiaraus, and of Mopsus, to which Celsus would send us, assuring us that we would there <q>see the gods in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, appearing to us with all distinctness, and without illusion.</q> For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, feeding on the blood, and smoke, and odour of victims, and shut up by their base desires in prisons, which the Greeks call temples of the gods, but which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> are only the dwellings of deceitful <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. To this Celsus maliciously adds, in regard to these gods which, according to him, are in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, <q>they do not show themselves for once, or at intervals, like him who has deceived men, but they are ever open to intercourse with those who desire it.</q> From this remark, it would seem that Celsus supposes that the appearance of Christ to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> was like that of a spectre flitting before their eyes; whereas these gods, as he calls them, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> shape always present themselves to those who desire it. But how is it possible that a phantom which, as he describes it, flew past to deceive the beholders, could produce such effects after it had passed away, and could so turn the hearts of men as to lead them to regulate their actions according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in view of being hereafter judged by Him? And how could a phantom drive away <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and show other indisputable evidences of power, and that not in any one place, like these so-called gods in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but making its divine power felt through the whole world, in drawing and congregating together all who are found disposed to lead a good and noble life?</p>

<h2>Chapter 36</h2>

<p>After these remarks of Celsus, which we have endeavoured to answer as we could, he goes on to say, speaking of us: <q>Again they will ask, 'How can we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless by the perception of the senses? For how otherwise than through the senses are we able to gain any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>?'</q> To this he replies: <q>This is not the language of a man; it comes not from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but from the flesh. Let them hearken to us, if such a spiritless and carnal race are able to do so: if, instead of exercising the senses, you look upwards with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; if, turning away the eye of the body, you open the eye of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, thus and thus only will you be able to see God. And if you seek one to be your guide along this way, you must shun all deceivers and jugglers, who will introduce you to phantoms. Otherwise you will be acting the most ridiculous part, if, while you pronounce imprecations upon those others that are recognised as gods, treating them as <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, you yet do homage to a more wretched idol than any of these, which indeed is not even an idol or a phantom, but a dead man, and you seek a father like to him.</q> The first remark which we have to make on this passage is in regard to his use of personification, by which he makes us defend in this way the doctrine of the resurrection. This figure of speech is properly employed when the character and sentiments of the person introduced are faithfully preserved; but it is an abuse of the figure when these do not agree with the character and opinions of the speaker. Thus we should <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemn a man who put into the mouths of barbarians, slaves, or uneducated people the language of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> belonged to the author, and not to such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. And in like manner we should condemn a man for introducing <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are represented as wise and well versed in divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and should make them give expression to language which could only come out of the mouths of those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> or under the influence of vulgar <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Hence Homer is admired, among other things, for preserving a consistency of character in his heroes, as in Nestor, Ulysses, Diomede, Agamemnon, Telemachus, Penelope, and the rest. Euripides, on the contrary, was assailed in the comedies of Aristophanes as a frivolous talker, often putting into the mouth of a barbarian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, a wretched slave, the wise maxims which he had learned from Anaxagoras or some other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37</h2>

<p>Now if this is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> account of what constitutes the right and the wrong use of personification, have we not grounds for holding Celsus up to ridicule for thus ascribing to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> words which they never uttered? For if those whom he represents as speaking are the unlearned, how is it possible that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> could distinguish between <q>sense</q> and <q>reason,</q> between <q>objects of sense</q> and <q>objects of the reason?</q> To argue in this way, they would require to have studied under the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who deny all intellectual existences, and maintain that all that we apprehend is apprehended through the senses, and that all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> comes through the senses. But if, on the other hand, he puts these words into the mouth of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who search carefully into the meaning of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrines, the statements in question do not agree with their character and principles. For no one who has learned that God is invisible, and that certain of His works are invisible, that is to say, apprehended by the reason,  can say, as if to justify his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a resurrection, <q>How can they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except by the perception of the senses?</q> or, <q>How otherwise than through the senses can they gain any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>?</q> For it is not in any secret writings, perused only by a few wise men, but in such as are most widely diffused and most commonly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> among the people, that these words are written: <q>The invisible things of God from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.</q>  From whence it is to be inferred, that though men who live upon the earth have to begin with the use of the senses upon sensible objects, in order to go on from them to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things intellectual, yet their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> must not stop short with the objects of sense. And thus, while <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> would not say that it is impossible to have a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of intellectual objects without the senses, but rather that the senses supply the first means of obtaining <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, they might well ask the question, <q>Who can gain any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> without the senses?</q> without deserving the abuse of Celsus, when he adds, <q>This is not the language of a man; it comes not from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but from the flesh.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 38</h2>

<p>Since we hold that the great God is in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> simple, invisible, and incorporeal, Himself pure intelligence, or something transcending intelligence and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, we can never say that God is apprehended by any other means than through the intelligence which is formed in His image, though now, in the words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>we see in a glass obscurely, but then face to face.</q>  And if we use the expression <q>face to face,</q> let no one pervert its meaning; but let it be explained by this passage, <q>Beholding with open face the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord, we are changed into the same image, from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> which shows that we do not use the word in this connection to mean the visible face, but take it figuratively, in the same way as we have shown that the eyes, the ears, and the other parts of the body are employed. And it is certain that a man&mdash; I mean a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> using a body, otherwise called <q>the inner man,</q> or simply <q>the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></q>&mdash; would answer, not as Celsus makes us answer, but as the man of God himself teaches. It is certain also that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> will not make use of <q>the language of the flesh,</q> having learned as he has <q>to mortify the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the body</q>  by the spirit, and <q>to bear about in his body the dying of Jesus;</q>  and <q>mortify your members which are on the earth,</q>  and with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these words, <q>My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh,</q>  and again, <q>They that are in the flesh cannot please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  he strives in every way to live no longer according to the flesh, but only according to the Spirit.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39</h2>

<p>Now let us hear what it is that he invites us to learn, that we may ascertain from him how we are to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although he thinks that his words are beyond the capacity of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <q>Let them hear,</q> says he, <q>if they are able to do so.</q> We have then to consider what the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> wishes us to hear from him. But instead of instructing us as he ought, he abuses us; and while he should have shown his goodwill to those whom he addresses at the outset of his discourse, he stigmatizes as <q>a cowardly race</q> men who would rather die than abjure <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> even by a word, and who are ready to suffer every form of torture, or any kind of death. He also applies to us that epithet <q>carnal</q> or <q>flesh-indulging,</q> <q>although,</q> as we are wont to say, <q>we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him no more,</q>  and although we are so ready to lay down our lives for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of religion, that no <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> could lay aside his robes more readily. He then addresses to us these words: <q>If, instead of exercising your senses, you look upwards with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; if, turning away the eye of the body, you open the eye of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, thus and thus only you will be able to see God.</q> He is not aware that this reference to the two eyes, the eye of the body and the eye of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which he has borrowed from the Greeks, was in use among our own writers; for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, in his account of the creation of the world, introduces man before his transgression as both seeing and not seeing: seeing, when it is said of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <q>The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> saw that the tree was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise;</q>  and again not seeing, as when he introduces the serpent saying to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, as if she and her husband had been blind, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that on the day that you eat thereof your eyes shall be opened;</q>  and also when it is said, <q>They ate, and the eyes of both of them were opened.</q>  The eyes of sense were then opened, which they had done well to keep shut, that they might not be distracted, and hindered from seeing with the eyes of the mind; and it was those eyes of the mind which in consequence of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, were then closed, with which they had up to that time enjoyed the delight of beholding God and His paradise. This twofold kind of vision in us was familiar to our Saviour, who says, <q>For judgment I have come into this world, that they which see not, might see, and that they which see might be made blind,</q> &mdash; meaning, by the eyes that see not, the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which are enlightened by His teaching; and the eyes which see are the eyes of sense, which His words do render blind, in order that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may look without distraction upon proper objects. All <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> therefore have the eye of the mind sharpened, and the eye of sense closed; so that each one, according to the degree in which his better eye is quickened, and the eye of sense darkened, sees and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and His Son, who is the Word, Wisdom, and so forth.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40</h2>

<p>Next to the remarks of Celsus on which we have already commented, come others which he addresses to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but which, if applicable to any, ought to be addressed to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whose doctrines differ entirely from those taught by Jesus. For it is the Ophians who, as we have before shown,  have utterly renounced Jesus, and perhaps some others of similar opinions who are <q>the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a> and jugglers, leading men away to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and phantoms;</q> and it is they who with miserable pains learn off the names of the heavenly doorkeepers. These words are therefore quite inappropriate as addressed to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>: <q>If you seek one to be your guide along this way, you must shun all deceivers and jugglers, who will introduce you to phantoms.</q> And, as though quite unaware that these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a> entirely agree with him, and are not behind him in speaking ill of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and His religion, he thus continues, confounding us with them: <q>otherwise you will be acting the most ridiculous part, if, while you pronounce imprecations upon those other recognised gods, treating them as <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, you yet do homage to a more wretched idol than any of these, which indeed is not even an idol or a phantom, but a dead man, and you seek a father like to himself.</q> That he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the wide difference between our opinions and those of the inventors of these fables, and that he imagines the charges which he makes against them applicable to us, is evident from the following passage: <q>For the sake of such a monstrous delusion, and in support of those wonderful advisers, and those wonderful words which you address to the lion, to the amphibious creature, to the creature in the form of an ass, and to others, for the sake of those divine doorkeepers whose names you commit to memory with such pains, in such a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as this you suffer cruel tortures, and perish at the stake.</q> Surely, then, he is unaware that none of those who regard beings in the form of an ass, a lion, or an amphibious animal, as the doorkeepers or guides on the way to heaven, ever expose themselves to death in defence of that which they think the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. That excess of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, if it may be so called, which leads us for the sake of religion to submit to every kind of death, and to perish at the stake, is ascribed by Celsus to those who endure no such sufferings; and he reproaches us who suffer crucifixion for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with believing in fabulous creatures&mdash; in the lion, the amphibious animal, and other such monsters. If we reject all these fables, it is not out of deference to Celsus, for we have never at any time held any such fancies; but it is in accordance with the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> that we oppose all such notions, and will not allow to Michael, or to any others that have been referred to, a form and figure of that sort.</p>

<h2>Chapter 41</h2>

<p>But let us consider who those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are whose guidance Celsus would have us to follow, so that we may not be in want of guides who are recommended both by their antiquity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. He refers us to divinely inspired poets, as he calls them, to wise men and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, without mentioning their names; so that, after promising to point out those who should guide us, he simply hands us over in a general way to divinely inspired poets, wise men, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. If he had specified their names in particular, we should have felt ourselves bound to show him that he wished to give us as guides men who were blinded to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and who must therefore lead us into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; or that if not wholly blinded, yet they are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in many matters of belief. But whether Orpheus, Parmenides, Empedocles, or even Homer himself, and Hesiod, are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom he means by <q>inspired poets,</q> let any one show how those who follow their guidance walk in a better way, or lead a more excellent life, than those who, being taught in the school of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, have rejected all images and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, and even all Jewish <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, that they may look upward through the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> to the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the Father of the Word. Who, then, are those wise men and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> from whom Celsus would have us to learn so many divine truths, and for whom we are to give up <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the Creator of the world, who have spoken so many things by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine inspiration, and even Him who has given light and taught the way of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, so that no one can reproach Him if he remains without a share in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>? Such, indeed, was the abounding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which He had for men, that He gave to the more learned a theology capable of raising the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> far above all earthly things; while with no less consideration He comes down to the weaker capacities of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men, of simple <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, of slaves, and, in short, of all those who from Jesus alone could have received that help for the better regulation of their lives which is supplied by his instructions in regard to the Divine Being, adapted to their wants and capacities.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42</h2>

<p>Celsus next refers us to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> as to a more effective teacher of theological <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and quotes the following passage from the <em>Tim&aelig;us</em>: <q>It is a hard matter to find out the Maker and Father of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; and after having found Him, it is impossible to make Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all.</q> To which he himself adds this remark: <q>You perceive, then, how divine men seek after the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and how well <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was impossible for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to walk in it. But as wise men have found it for the express purpose of being able to convey to us some notion of Him who is the first, the unspeakable Being&mdash;a notion, namely; which may represent Him to us through the medium of other objects&mdash;they endeavour either by synthesis, which is the combining of various qualities, or by analysis, which is the separation and setting aside of some qualities, or finally by analogy&mdash;in these ways, I say, they endeavour to set before us that which it is impossible to express in words. I should therefore be surprised if you could follow in that course, since you are so completely wedded to the flesh as to be incapable of seeing ought but what is impure.</q> These words of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> are noble and admirable; but see if Scripture does not give us an example of a regard for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> still greater in <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, who was <q>in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and <q>who was made flesh,</q> in order that He might reveal to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> truths which, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, it would be impossible to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, even after he had found them himself. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> may say that <q>it is a hard thing to find out the Creator and Father of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>;</q> by which language he implies that it is not wholly beyond the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to attain to such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as is either worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or if not, is far beyond that which is commonly attained (although if it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> or any other of the Greeks had found <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they would never have given homage and worship, or ascribed the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to any other than to Him: they would have abandoned all others, and would not have associated with this great God objects which can have nothing in common with Him).  For ourselves, we maintain that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is in no way able to seek after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to attain a clear <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him without the help of Him whom it seeks. He makes Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to those who, after doing all that their powers will allow, confess that they need help from Him, who discovers Himself to those whom He approves, in so far as it is possible for man and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> still dwelling in the body to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 43</h2>

<p>Observe that when <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says, that <q>after having found out the Creator and Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, it is impossible to make Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> he does not speak of Him as unspeakable, and as incapable of being expressed in words. On the contrary, he implies that He may be spoken of, and that there are a few to whom He may be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But Celsus, as if forgetting the language which he had just quoted from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, immediately gives God the name of <q>the unspeakable.</q> He says: <q>since the wise men have found out this way, in order to be able to give us some idea of the First of Beings, who is unspeakable.</q> For ourselves, we hold that not God alone is unspeakable, but other things also which are inferior to Him. Such are the things which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> labours to express when he says, <q>I heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter,</q>  where the word <q>heard</q> is used in the sense of <q>understood;</q> as in the passage, <q>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</q> We also hold that it is a hard matter to see the Creator and Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; but it is possible to see Him in the way thus referred to, <q>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  and not only so, but also in the sense of the words of Him <q>who is the image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <q>He who has seen Me has seen the Father who sent Me.</q>  No sensible person could suppose that these last words were spoken in reference to His bodily presence, which was open to the view of all; otherwise all those who said, <q>Crucify him, crucify him,</q> and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, who had power over the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, were among those who saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which is absurd. Moreover, that these words, <q>He that has seen Me, has seen the Father who sent Me,</q> are not to be taken in their grosser sense, is plain from the answer which He gave to Philip, <q>Have I been so long time with you, and yet do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Me, Philip?</q> after Philip had asked, <q>Show us the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and it suffices us.</q> He, then, who perceives how these words, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>,</q> are to be understood of the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of all creation, will also understand how, in seeing the image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we see <q>the Creator and Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 44</h2>

<p>Celsus supposes that we may arrive at a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God either by combining or separating certain things after the methods which mathematicians call synthesis and analysis, or again by analogy, which is employed by them also, and that in this way we may as it were gain admission to the chief good. But when the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> says, <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him,</q>  He declares that no one can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God but by the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> coming from above, with a certain divine inspiration. Indeed, it is reasonable to suppose that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God is beyond the reach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and hence the many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> into which men have fallen in their views of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is, then, through the goodness and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and by a marvellous exercise of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> to those whom He saw in His foreknowledge, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they would walk worthy of Him who had made Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them, and that they would never swerve from a faithful attachment to His service, although they were condemned to death or held up to ridicule by those who, in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion is, give that name to what deserves to be called anything rather than religion. God doubtless saw the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and arrogance of those who, with contempt for all others, boast of their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of their profound acquaintance with divine things obtained from <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, but who still, not less even than the most <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, run after their images, and temples, and famous <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; and seeing this, He <q>has chosen the foolish things of this world</q> &mdash; the simplest of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who lead, however, a life of greater moderation and purity than many <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>&mdash; <q>to confound the wise,</q> who are not ashamed to address inanimate things as gods or images of the gods. For what reasonable man can refrain from smiling when he sees that one who has learned from <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> such profound and noble sentiments about God or the gods, turns straightway to images and offers to them his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, or imagines that by gazing upon these material things he can ascend from the visible <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> to that which is spiritual and immaterial.  But a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, even of the common people, is assured that every place forms part of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and that the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is God's temple. In whatever part of the world he is, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>; but he rises above the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, <q>shutting the eyes of sense, and raising upwards the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> And he stops not at the vault of heaven; but passing in thought beyond the heavens, under the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and having thus as it had gone beyond the visible <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, he offers <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for no trivial blessings, for he has learned from Jesus to seek for nothing small or mean, that is, sensible objects, but to ask only for what is great and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine; and these things God grants to us, to lead us to that blessedness which is found only with Him through His Son, the Word, who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 45</h2>

<p>But let us see further what the things are which he proposes to teach us, if indeed we can comprehend them, since he speaks of us as being <q>utterly wedded to the flesh;</q> although if we live well, and in accordance with the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, we hear this said of us: <q>You are not in the flesh, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwells in you.</q>  He says also that we look upon nothing that is pure, although our endeavour is to keep even our thoughts free from all defilement of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and although in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> we say, <q>Create in me a clean heart, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and renew a right spirit within me,</q>  so that we may behold Him with that <q>pure heart</q> to which alone is granted the privilege of seeing Him. This, then, is what he proposes for our instruction: <q>Things are either <em>intelligible</em>, which we call substance&mdash; being; or <em>visible</em>, which we call <em>becoming</em>:  with the former is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; from the latter arises <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Truth is the object of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> form opinion. Intelligible objects are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the reason, visible objects by the eyes; the action of the reason is called intelligent perception, that of the eyes vision. As, then, among visible things the sun is neither the eye nor vision, but that which enables the eye to see, and renders vision possible, and in consequence of it visible things are seen, all sensible things exist and itself is rendered visible; so among things intelligible, that which is neither reason, nor intelligent perception, nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, is yet the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which enables the reason to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, which renders intelligent perception possible; and in consequence of it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> arises, all things intelligible, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself and substance have their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and itself, which is above all these things, becomes in some ineffable way intelligible. These things are offered to the consideration of the intelligent; and if even you can understand any of them, it is well. And if you think that a Divine Spirit has descended from God to announce divine things to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, it is doubtless this same Spirit that reveals these truths, and it was under the same influence that men of old made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> many important truths. But if you cannot comprehend these things, then keep silence; do not expose your own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and do not accuse of blindness those who see, or of lameness those who run, while you yourselves are utterly lamed and mutilated in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and lead a merely animal life&mdash; the life of the body, which is the dead part of our nature.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 46</h2>

<p>We are careful not to oppose fair arguments even if they proceed from those who are not of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; we strive not to be captious, or to seek to overthrow any sound reasonings. But here we have to reply to those who <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> the character of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> wishing to do their best in the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who accepts the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which the meanest place in Him, as well as the more refined and intelligent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the learned; seeing that both alike address to the Creator of the world their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and thanksgivings through the High Priest who has set before men the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of pure religion. We say, then, that those who are stigmatized as <q>lamed and mutilated in spirit,</q> as <q>living only for the sake of the body which is dead,</q> are <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whose endeavour it is to say with sincerity: <q>For though we live  in the flesh, we do not <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> according to the flesh; for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but mighty through God.</q> It is for those who throw out such vile accusations against men who desire to be God's servants, to beware lest, by the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> which they cast upon others who strive to live well, they <q>lame</q> their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and <q>mutilate</q> the inner man, by severing from it that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and moderation of mind which the Creator has planted in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of all His rational creatures. As for those, however, who, along with other lessons given by the Divine Word, have learned and practised this, <q>when reviled to bless, when <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> to endure, when defamed to entreat,</q>  they may be said to be walking in spirit in the ways of uprightness, to be purifying and setting in order the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. They distinguish&mdash; and to them the distinction is not one of words merely&mdash; between <q>substance,</q> or that which is, and that which is <q>becoming;</q> between things apprehended by reason, and things apprehended by sense; and they connect <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with the one, and avoid the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> arising out of the other; looking, as they have been taught, not at the things <q>becoming</q> or phenomenal, which are seen, and therefore temporary, but at better things than these, whether we call them <q>substance,</q> or <q>spiritual</q> things, as being apprehended by reason, or <q>invisible,</q> because they lie out of the reach of the senses. The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> regard these phenomenal things only that they may use them as steps to ascend to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the things of reason. For <q>the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> that is, the objects of the reason, <q>from the creation of the world are clearly seen</q> by the reason, <q>being understood by the things that are made.</q> And when they have risen from the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things of this world to the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they do not stay there; but after they have sufficiently exercised their minds upon these, and have understood their nature, they ascend to <q>the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> in a word, to His divinity. For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, has <q>manifested</q> His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <q>that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of Him,</q> not only to those who devote themselves to His service, but also to some who are far removed from the purity of worship and service which He requires; and that some of those who by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God had attained a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these truths, were yet doing things unworthy of that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and <q>holding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness,</q> and who are unable to find any excuse before God after the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of such great truths which He has given them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 47</h2>

<p>For Scripture testifies, in regard to those who have a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those things of which Celsus speaks, and who profess a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> founded on these principles, that they, <q>when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations;</q> and notwithstanding the bright light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had enlightened them, <q>their foolish heart</q> was carried away, and became <q>darkened.</q>  Thus we may see how those who accounted themselves wise gave <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of great folly, when, after such grand arguments delivered in the schools on God and on things apprehended by the reason, they <q>changed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.</q>  As, then, they lived in a way unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which they had received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> leaving them to themselves, they were given <q>up to uncleanness, through the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies,</q>  in shamelessness and licentiousness, because they <q>changed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of God into a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 48</h2>

<p>But those who are despised for their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and set down as fools and abject slaves, no sooner commit themselves to God's guidance by accepting the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, than, so far from defiling themselves by licentious indulgence or the gratification of shameless passion, they in many cases, like perfect <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, for whom such pleasures have no charm, keep themselves in act and in thought in a state of virgin purity. The <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> have one hierophant, who, not having confidence in his power to restrain his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> within the limits he prescribed for himself, determined to check them at their seat by the application of hemlock; and thus he was accounted pure, and fit for the celebration of religious worship among the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>. But among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> may be found men who have no need of hemlock to fit them for the pure service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for whom the Word in place of hemlock is able to drive all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires from their thoughts, so that they may present their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to the Divine Being. And attached to the other so-called gods are a select number of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, who are guarded by men, or it may be not guarded (for that is not the point in question at present), and who are supposed to live in purity for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the god they serve. But among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, those who maintain a perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> do so for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> honours, for no fee or reward, from no motive of vainglory;  but <q>as they choose to retain God in their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q>  they are preserved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a spirit well-pleasing to Him, and in the discharge of every duty, being filled with all righteousness and goodness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 49</h2>

<p>What I have now said, then, is offered not for the purpose of cavilling with any right opinions or sound doctrines held even by Greeks, but with the desire of showing that the same things, and indeed much better and diviner things than these, have been said by those divine men, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of Jesus. These truths are fully investigated by all who wish to attain a perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <q>the mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his tongue talks of judgment; the law of his God is in his heart.</q>  But even in regard to those who, either from deficiency or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or want of inclination, or from not having Jesus to lead them to a rational view of religion, have not gone into these deep questions, we find that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Most High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in His Only-begotten Son, the Word and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that they often exhibit in their character a high degree of gravity, of purity, and integrity; while those who call themselves wise have despised these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and have wallowed in the filth of sodomy, in lawless <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, <q>men with men working that which is unseemly.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 50</h2>

<p>Celsus has not explained how <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> accompanies the <q>becoming,</q> or product of generation; nor has he expressed himself with sufficient clearness to enable us to compare his ideas with ours, and to pass judgment on them. But the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who have given some wise suggestions on the subject of things produced by generation, tell us that a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was offered even for new-born infants, as not being free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.  They say, <q>I was shapen in iniquity, and in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> did my mother conceive me;</q>  also, <q>They are estranged from the womb;</q> which is followed by the singular expression, <q>They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.</q>  Besides, our wise men have such a contempt for all sensible objects, that sometimes they speak of all material things as vanity: thus, <q>For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him that subjected the same in hope;</q>  at other times as vanity of vanities, <q>Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, all is vanity.</q>  Who has given so severe an estimate of the life of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> here on earth, as he who says: <q>Verily every man at his best estate is altogether vanity?</q>  He does not hesitate at all as to the difference between the present life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and that which it is to lead hereafter. He does not say, <q>Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> if to die is not to live, and if to live is not death</q>  But he boldly proclaims the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and says, <q>Our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is bowed down to the dust;</q>  and, <q>You have brought me into the dust of death;</q>  and similarly, <q>Who will deliver me from the body of this death?</q>  also, <q>Who will change the body of our humiliation.</q>  It is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> also who says, <q>You have brought us down in a place of affliction;</q>  meaning by the <q>place of affliction</q> this earthly region, to which Adam, that is to say, man, came after he was driven out of paradise for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Observe also how well the different life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> here and hereafter has been recognised by him who says, <q>Now we see in a glass, obscurely, but then face to face;</q>  and, <q>Whilst we are in our home in the body, we are away from our home in the Lord;</q> wherefore <q>we are well content to go from our home in the body, and to come to our home with the Lord.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 51</h2>

<p>But what need is there to quote any more passages against Celsus, in order to prove that his words contain nothing which was not said long before among themselves, since that has been sufficiently established by what we have said? It seems that what follows has some reference to this: <q>If you think that a Divine Spirit has descended from God to announce divine things to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, it is doubtless this same Spirit that reveals these truths; and it was under the same influence that men of old made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> many important truths.</q> But he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how great is the difference between those things and the clear and certain teaching of those who say to us, <q>Your incorruptible spirit is in all things, wherefore God chastens them little by little that offend;</q>  and of those who, among their other instructions, teach us that words, <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q>  refer to a degree of spiritual influence higher than that in the passage, <q>You shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> not many days hence.</q>  But it is a difficult matter, even after much careful consideration, to perceive the difference between those who have received a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and a notion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at different intervals and for short periods of time, and those who are more fully inspired by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who have constant communion with Him, and are always led by His Spirit. Had Celsus set himself to understand this, he would not have reproached as with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or forbidden us to characterize as <q>blind</q> those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that religion shows itself in such products of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mechanical art as images. For every one who sees with the eyes of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> serves the Divine Being in no other way than in that which leads him ever to have regard to the Creator of all, to address his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to Him alone, and to do all things as in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who sees us altogether, even to our thoughts. Our earnest desire then is both to see for ourselves, and to be leaders of the blind, to bring them to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, that He may take away from their minds the blindness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. And if our actions are worthy of Him who taught His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>You are the light of the world,</q>  and of the Word, who says, <q>The light shines in darkness,</q>  then we shall be light to those who are in darkness; we shall give wisdom to those who are without it, and we shall instruct the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 52</h2>

<p>And let not Celsus be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> if we describe as lame and mutilated in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> those who run to the temples as to places having a real sacredness and who cannot see that no mere mechanical work of man can be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> sacred. Those whose <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is grounded on the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> also run until they come to the end of their course, when they can say in all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and confidence: <q>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.</q>  And each of us runs <q>not as uncertain,</q> and he so fights with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <q>not as one beating the air,</q>  but as against those who are subject to <q>the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience.</q>  Celsus may indeed say of us that we <q>live with the body which is a dead thing;</q> but we have learned, <q>If you live after the flesh, you shall die; but if you by the Spirit do mortify the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the body, you shall live;</q>  and, <q>If we live in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, let us also walk in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</q>  Would that we might convince him by our actions that he did us wrong, when he said that we <q>live with the body which is dead!</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 53</h2>

<p>After these remarks of Celsus, which we have done our best to refute, he goes on to address us thus: <q>Seeing you are so eager for some novelty, how much better it would have been if you had chosen as the object of your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> homage some one of those who died a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> death, and whose divinity might have received the support of some myth to perpetuate his memory! Why, if you were not satisfied with Hercules or &AElig;sculapius, and other heroes of antiquity, you had Orpheus, who was confessedly a divinely inspired man, who died a violent death. But perhaps some others have taken him up before you. You may then take Anaxarchus, who, when cast into a mortar, and beaten most barbarously, showed a noble contempt for his suffering, and said, 'Beat, beat the shell of Anaxarchus, for himself you do not beat,'&mdash; a speech surely of a spirit <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine. But others were before you in following his interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature. Might you not, then, take Epictetus, who, when his master was twisting his leg, said, smiling and. unmoved, 'You will break my leg;' and when it was broken, he added, 'Did I not tell you that you would break it?' What saying equal to these did your god utter under suffering? If you had said even of the Sibyl, whose authority some of you acknowledge, that she was a child of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you would have said something more reasonable. But you have had the presumption to include in her writings many impious things,  and set up as a god one who ended a most <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> life by a most miserable death. How much more suitable than he would have been Jonah in the whale's belly, or Daniel delivered from the wild beasts, or any of a still more portentous kind!</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 54</h2>

<p>But since he sends us to Hercules, let him repeat to us any of his sayings, and let him justify his shameful subjection to Omphale. Let him show that divine honours should be paid to one who, like a highway robber, carries off a farmer's ox by force, and afterwards devours it, amusing himself meanwhile with the curses of the owner; in memory of which even to this day <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> of Hercules are accompanied with curses. Again he proposes &AElig;sculapius to us, as if to oblige us to repeat what we have said already; but we forbear. In regard to Orpheus, what does he admire in him to make him assert that, by common consent, he was regarded as a divinely inspired man, and lived a noble life? I am greatly deceived if it is not the desire which Celsus has to oppose us and put down Jesus that leads him to sound forth the praises of Orpheus; and whether, when he made himself acquainted with his impious fables about the gods, he did not cast them aside as deserving, even more than the poems of Homer, to be excluded from a well-ordered state. For, indeed, Orpheus says much worse things than Homer of those whom they call gods. Noble, indeed, it was in Anaxarchus to say to Aristocreon, tyrant of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, <q>Beat on, beat the shell of Anaxarchus,</q> but it is the one admirable incident in the life of Anaxarchus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the Greeks; and although, on the strength of that, some like Celsus might deservedly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the man for his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, yet to look up to Anaxarchus as a god is not consistent with reason. He also directs us to Epictetus, whose firmness is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> admired, although his saying when his leg was broken by his master is not to be compared with the marvellous acts and words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> which Celsus refuses to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and these words were accompanied by such a divine power, that even to this day they convert not only some of the more <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and simple, but many also of the most enlightened of men.</p>

<h2>Chapter 55</h2>

<p>When, to his enumeration of those to whom he would send us, he adds, <q>What saying equal to these did your god utter under sufferings?</q> we would reply, that the silence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> under scourgings, and amidst all His sufferings, spoke more for His firmness and submission than all that was said by the Greeks when beset by calamity. Perhaps Celsus may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what was recorded with all sincerity by trustworthy men, who, while giving a truthful account of all the wonders performed by Jesus, specify among these the silence which He preserved when subjected to scourgings; showing the same singular meekness under the insults which were heaped upon Him, when they put upon Him the purple robe, and set the crown of thorns upon His head, and when they put in His hand a reed in place of a sceptre: no unworthy or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> word escaped Him against those who subjected Him to such outrages. Since, then, He received the scourgings with silent firmness, and bore with meekness all the insults of those who outraged Him, it cannot be said, as is said by some, that it was in cowardly weakness that He uttered the words: <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which seems to be contained in these words for the removal of what He calls <q>the cup</q> bears a sense which we have elsewhere examined and set forth at large. But taking it in its more obvious sense, consider if it be not a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> offered to God with all <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. For no man naturally regards anything which may befall him as necessary and inevitable; though he may submit to what is not inevitable, if occasion requires. Besides, these words, <q>nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will,</q> are not the language of one who yielded to necessity, but of one who was contented with what was befalling Him, and who submitted with reverence to the arrangements of Providence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 56</h2>

<p>Celsus then adds, for what reason I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, that instead of calling Jesus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, we had better have given that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the Sibyl, in whose books he maintains we have interpolated many impious statements, though he does not mention what those interpolations are.  He might have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> his assertion by producing some older copies which are free from the interpolations which he attributes to us; but he does not do so even to justify his statement that these passages are of an impious character. Moreover, he again speaks of the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as <q>a most <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> life,</q> as he has done before, not once or twice, but many times, although he does not stay to specify any of the actions of His life which he thinks most <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>. He seems to think that he may in this way make assertions without proving them, and rail against one of whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing. Had he set himself to show what sort of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> he found in the actions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, we should have repelled the several charges brought against Him. Jesus did indeed meet with a most sad death; but the same might be said of Socrates, and of Anaxarchus, whom he had just mentioned, and a multitude of others. If the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was a miserable one, was not that of the others so too? And if their death was not miserable, can it be said that the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was? You see from this, then, that the object of Celsus is to vilify the character of Jesus; and I can only suppose that he is driven to it by some spirit akin to those whose power has been broken and vanquished by Jesus, and which now finds itself deprived of the smoke and blood on which it lived, while deceiving those who sought for God here upon earth in images, instead of looking up to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Governor of all things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 57</h2>

<p>After this, as though his object was to swell the size of his book, he advises us <q>to choose Jonah rather than Jesus as our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> thus setting Jonah, who preached repentance to the single city of Nineveh, before Jesus, who has preached repentance to the whole world, and with much greater results. He would have us to regard as God a man who, by a strange <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, passed three days and three nights in the whale's belly; and he is unwilling that He who submitted to death for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, He to whom God bore testimony through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and who has done great things in heaven and earth, should receive on that ground <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> second only to that which is given to the Most High God. Moreover, Jonah was swallowed by the whale for refusing to preach as God had commanded him; while Jesus suffered death for men after He had given the instructions which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wished Him to give. Still further, he adds that Daniel rescued from the lions is more worthy of our adoration than Jesus, who subdued the fierceness of every opposing power, and gave to us <q>authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy.</q>  Finally, having no other names to offer us, he adds, <q>and others of a still more monstrous kind,</q> thus casting a slight upon both Jonah and Daniel, for the spirit which is in Celsus cannot speak well of the righteous.</p>

<h2>Chapter 58</h2>

<p>Let us now consider what follows. <q>They have also,</q> says he, <q>a precept to this effect, that we ought not to avenge ourselves on one who injures us, or, as he expresses it, 'Whosoever shall strike you on the one cheek, turn to him the other also.' This is an ancient saying, which had been admirably expressed long before, and which they have only reported in a coarser way. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> introduces Socrates conversing with Crito as follows: 'Must we never do <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to any?' 'Certainly not.' 'And since we must never do <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, must we not return <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> for an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> that has been done to us, as most people think?' 'It seems to me that we should not.' 'But tell me, Crito, may we do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to any one or not?' 'Certainly not, O Socrates.' 'Well, is it just, as is commonly said, for one who has suffered wrong to do wrong in return, or is it <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>?' 'It is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. Yes; for to do harm to a man is the same as to do him <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.' 'You speak <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>. We must then not do <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in return for <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, nor must we do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to any one, whatever <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> we may have suffered from him.' Thus <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> speaks; and he adds, 'Consider, then, whether you are at one with me, and whether, starting from this principle, we may not come to the conclusion that it is never right to do <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, even in return for an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> which has been received; or whether, on the other hand, you differ from me, and do not admit the principle from which we started. That has always been my opinion, and is so still.'  Such are the sentiments of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and indeed they were held by divine men before his time. But let this suffice as one example of the way in which this and other truths have been borrowed and corrupted. Any one who wishes can easily by searching find more of them.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 59</h2>

<p>When Celsus here or elsewhere finds himself unable to dispute the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of what we say, but avers that the same things were said by the Greeks, our answer is, that if the doctrine be sound, and the effect of it good, whether it was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the Greeks by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> or any of the wise men of Greece, or whether it was delivered to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> or any of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, or whether it was given to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the recorded teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, or in the instructions of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that does not affect the value of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> communicated. It is no objection to the principles of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that the same things were also said by the Greeks, especially if it be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the writings of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are older than those of the Greeks. And further, we are not to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> adorned with the graces of Grecian speech is necessarily better than the same when expressed in the more <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and unpretending language used by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, although indeed the language of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> wrote the books which have come down to us, has a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of expression peculiar to the genius of the Hebrew tongue. And even if we were required to show that the same doctrines have been better expressed among the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> or in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writings, however paradoxical it may seem, we are prepared to prove this by an illustration taken from different kinds of food, and from the different modes of preparing them. Suppose that a kind of food which is wholesome and nutritious has been prepared and seasoned in such a way as to be fit, not for the simple tastes of peasants and poor labourers, but for those only who are rich and dainty in their tastes. Suppose, again, that that same food is prepared not to suit the tastes of the more delicate, but for the peasants, the poor labourers, and the common people generally, in short, so that myriads of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> might eat of it. Now if, according to the supposition, the food prepared in the one way promotes the health of those only who are styled the better classes, while none of the others could taste it, whereas when prepared in the other way it promoted the health of great multitudes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which shall we esteem as most contributing to the public welfare&mdash;those who prepare food for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of mark, or those who prepare it for the multitudes?&mdash; taking for granted that in both cases the food is equally wholesome and nourishing; while it is evident that the welfare of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> and the common good are promoted better by that physician who attends to the health of the many, than by one who confines his attention to a few.</p>

<h2>Chapter 60</h2>

<p>Now, after understanding this illustration, we have to apply it to the qualities of spiritual food with which the rational part of man is nourished. See, then, if <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and the wise men among the Greeks, in the beautiful things they say, are not like those physicians who confine their attentions to what are called the better classes of society, and despise the multitude; whereas the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, who despise mere elegances of style, and what is called in Scripture <q>the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> <q>the wisdom according to the flesh,</q> which delights in what is obscure, resemble those who study to provide the most wholesome food for the largest number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For this purpose they adapt their language and style to the capacities of the common people, and avoid whatever would seem foreign to them, lest by the introduction of strange forms of expression they should produce a distaste for their teaching. Indeed, if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> use of spiritual food, to keep up the figure, is to produce in him who partakes of it the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of patience and gentleness, must that discourse not be better prepared when it produces patience and gentleness in multitudes, or makes them grow in these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, than that which confines its effects to a select few, supposing that it does really make them gentle and patient? If a Greek wished by wholesome instruction to benefit people who understood only <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> or Syriac, the first thing that he would do would be to learn their language; and he would rather pass for a Barbarian among the Greeks, by speaking as the Egyptians or Syrians, in order to be useful to them, than always remain Greek, and be without the means of helping them. In the same way the divine nature, having the purpose of instructing not only those who are reputed to be learned in the literature of Greece, but also the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, accommodated itself to the capacities of the simple multitudes whom it addressed. It seeks to win the attention of the more <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> by the use of language which is familiar to them, so that they may easily be induced, after their first introduction, to strive after an acquaintance with the deeper truths which lie hidden in Scripture. For even the ordinary reader of Scripture may see that it contains many things which are too deep to be apprehended at first; but these are understood by such as devote themselves to a careful study of the divine word, and they become plain to them in proportion to the pains and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> which they expend upon its investigation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 61</h2>

<p>From these remarks it is evident, that when Jesus said <q>coarsely,</q> as Celsus terms it, <q>To him who shall strike you on the one cheek, turn the other also; and if any man be minded to sue you at the law, and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also,</q>  He expressed Himself in such a way as to make the precept have more practical effect than the words of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in the <em>Crito</em>; for the latter is so far from being intelligible to ordinary <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, that even those have a difficulty in understanding him, who have been brought up in the schools of learning, and have been initiated into the famous <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of Greece. It may also be observed, that the precept enjoining patience under injuries is in no way corrupted or degraded by the plain and simple language which our Lord employs, but that in this, as in other cases, it is a mere <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> against our religion which he utters when he says: <q>But let this suffice as one example of the way in which this and other truths have been borrowed and corrupted. Any one who wishes can easily by searching find more of them.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 62</h2>

<p>Let us now see what follows. <q>Let us pass on,</q> says he, <q>to another point. They cannot tolerate temples, altars, or images.  In this they are like the Scythians, the nomadic tribes of Libya, the Seres who worship no god, and some other of the most barbarous and impious nations in the world. That the Persians hold the same notions is shown by Herodotus in these words: 'I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that among the Persians it is considered unlawful to erect images, altars, or temples; but they charge those with folly who do so, because, as I conjecture, they do not, like the Greeks, suppose the gods to be of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of men.'  Heraclitus also says in one place: 'Persons who address <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to these images act like those who speak to the walls, without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> who the gods or the heroes are.' And what wiser lesson have they to teach us than Heraclitus? He certainly plainly enough implies that it is a foolish thing for a man to offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to images, while he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not who the gods and heroes are. This is the opinion of Heraclitus; but as for them, they go further, and despise without exception all images. If they merely mean that the stone, wood, brass, or gold which has been wrought by this or that workman cannot be a god, they are ridiculous with their wisdom. For who, unless he be utterly childish in his simplicity, can take these for gods, and not for offerings <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the service of the gods, or images representing them? But if we are not to regard these as representing the Divine Being, seeing that God has a different form, as the Persians concur with them in saying, then let them take care that they do not contradict themselves; for they say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man His own image, and that He gave him a form like to Himself. However, they will admit that these images, whether they are like or not, are made and dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of certain beings. But they will hold that the beings to whom they are dedicated are not gods, but <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and that a worshipper of God ought not to worship <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 63</h2>

<p>To this our answer is, that if the Scythians, the nomadic tribes of Libya, the Seres, who according to Celsus have no god, if those other most barbarous and impious nations in the world, and if the Persians even cannot bear the sight of temples, altars, and images, it does not follow because we cannot suffer them any more than they, that the grounds on which we object to them are the same as theirs. We must inquire into the principles on which the objection to temples and images is founded, in order that we may approve of those who object on sound principles, and condemn those whose principles are false. For one and the same thing may be done for different reasons. For example, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who follow Zeno of Citium abstain from committing <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, the followers of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> do so too, as well as others again who do so on no <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> principles; but observe what different reasons determine the conduct of these different classes. The first consider the interests of society, and hold it to be forbidden by nature that a man who is a reasonable being should corrupt a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> have already given to another, and should thus break up the household of another man. The <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> do not reason in this way; but if they abstain from <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, it is because, regarding pleasure as the chief end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, they perceive that one who gives himself up to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, encounters for the sake of this one pleasure a multitude of obstacles to pleasure, such as imprisonment, exile, and death itself. They often, indeed, run considerable risk at the outset, while watching for the departure from the house of the master and those in his interest. So that, supposing it possible for a man to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and escape the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the husband, of his servants, and of others whose esteem he would forfeit, then the Epicurean would yield to the commission of the crime for the sake of pleasure. The man of no <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system, again, who abstains from <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> when the opportunity comes to him, does so generally from dread of the law and its penalties, and not for the sake of enjoying a greater number of other pleasures. You see, then, that an act which passes for being one and the same&mdash; namely, abstinence from <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>&mdash; is not the same, but differs in different men according to the motives which actuate it: one man refraining for sound reasons, another for such bad and impious ones as those of the Epicurean, and the common person of whom we have spoken.</p>

<h2>Chapter 64</h2>

<p>As, then, this act of self-restraint, which in appearance is one and the same, is found in fact to be different in different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, according to the principles and motives which lead to it; so in the same way with those who cannot allow in the worship of the Divine Being altars, or temples, or images. The Scythians, the Nomadic Libyans, the godless Seres, and the Persians, agree in this with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but they are actuated by very different principles. For none of these former abhor altars and images on the ground that they are afraid of degrading the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and reducing it to the worship of material things wrought by the hands of men.  Neither do they object to them from a belief that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> choose certain forms and places, whether because they are detained there by virtue of certain charms, or because for some other possible reason they have selected these haunts, where they may pursue their criminal pleasures, in partaking of the smoke of sacrificial victims. But <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have regard to this command, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and serve Him alone;</q>  and this other, <q>You shall have no other gods before Me: you shall not make unto you any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them;</q>  and again, <q>You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.</q>  It is in consideration of these and many other such commands, that they not only avoid temples, altars, and images, but are ready to suffer death when it is necessary, rather than debase by any such impiety the conception which they have of the Most High God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 65</h2>

<p>In regard to the Persians, we have already said that though they do not build temples, yet they worship the sun and the other works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This is forbidden to us, for we have been taught not to worship the creature instead of the Creator, but to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <q>the creation shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and <q>the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the revelation of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and <q>the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who made it subject, in hope.</q>  We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, therefore, that things <q>under the bondage of corruption,</q> and <q>subject to vanity,</q> which remain in this condition <q>in hope</q> of a better state, ought not in our worship to hold the place of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the all-sufficient, and of His Son, the First-born of all creation. Let this suffice, in addition to what we have already said of the Persians, who abhor altars and images, but who serve the creature instead of the Creator. As to the passage quoted by Celsus from Heraclitus, the purport of which he represents as being, <q>that it is childish folly for one to offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to images, while he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not who the gods and heroes are,</q> we may reply that it is easy to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God and the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and those whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has honoured with the title of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who partake of His divine nature, are very different from all the gods of the nations which are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; but it is not possible at the same time to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God and to address <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to images. </p>

<h2>Chapter 66</h2>

<p>And the charge of folly applies not only to those who offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to images, but also to such as pretend to do so in compliance with the example of the multitude: and to this class belong the Peripatetic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and the followers of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> and Democritus. For there is no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> or pretence in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is possessed with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards God. Another reason also why we abstain from doing <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to images, is that we may give no support to the notion that the images are gods. It is on this ground that we condemn Celsus, and all others who, while admitting that they are not gods, yet, with the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of being wise men, render to them what passes for homage. In this way they lead into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the multitude who follow their example, and who worship these images not simply out of deference to custom, but from a belief into which they have fallen that they are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> gods, and that those are not to be listened to who hold that the objects of their worship are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> gods. Celsus, indeed, says that <q>they do not take them for gods, but only as offerings dedicated to the gods.</q> But he does not prove that they are not rather dedicated to men than, as he says, to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the gods themselves; for it is clear that they are the offerings of men who were in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in their views of the Divine Being. Moreover, we do not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that these images are representations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for they cannot represent a being who is invisible and incorporeal.  But as Celsus supposes that we fall into a contradiction, while on the one hand we say that God has not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, and on the other we profess to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man the image of Himself, and created man the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; our answer is the same as has been given already, that we hold the resemblance to God to be preserved in the reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is formed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, although Celsus, who does not see the difference between <q>being the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and <q>being created after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> pretends that we said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man His own image, and gave him a form like to His own.</q> But this also has been examined before.</p>

<p>His next remark upon the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is: <q>They will admit that these images, whether they are like or not, are made and dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of certain beings; but they will hold that the beings to whom they are dedicated are not gods, but <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and that a worshipper of God ought not to worship <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</q> If he had been acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and with their several operations, whether led on to them by the conjurations of those who are skilled in the art, or urged on by their own inclination to act according to their power and inclination; if, I say, he had thoroughly understood this subject, which is both wide in extent and difficult for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> comprehension, he would not have condemned us for saying that those who worship the Supreme Being should not serve <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For ourselves, so far are we from wishing to serve <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, that by the use of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and other means which we learn from Scripture, we drive them out of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, out of places where they have established themselves, and even sometimes from the bodies of animals; for even these creatures often suffer from injuries inflicted upon them by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 68</h2>

<p>After all that we have already said concerning Jesus, it would be a useless repetition for us to answer these words of Celsus: <q>It is easy to convict them of worshipping not a god, not even <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but a dead person.</q> Leaving, then, this objection for the reason assigned, let us pass on to what follows: <q>In the first place, I would ask why we are not to serve <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? Is it not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that all things are ordered according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and that His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> governs all things? Is not everything which happens in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, whether it be the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, of other <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or of heroes, regulated by the law of the Most High God? Have these not had assigned them various departments of which they were severally deemed worthy? Is it not just, therefore, that he who worships God should serve those also to whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has assigned such power? Yet it is impossible, he says, for a man to serve many masters.</q> Observe here again how he settles at once a number of questions which require considerable research, and a profound acquaintance with what is most <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> in the government of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. For we must inquire into the meaning of the statement, that <q>all things are ordered according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>,</q> and ascertain whether <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are or are not included among the things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> orders. For if God's government extends to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not only in men, but also in <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and in any other spiritual beings who are capable of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is for those who speak in this manner to see how inconvenient is the expression that <q>all things are ordered by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For it follows from it that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and all their consequences are ordered by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is a different thing from saying that they come to pass with God's permission. For if we take the word <q>ordered</q> in its proper signification, and say that <q>all the results of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were ordered,</q> then it is evident that all things are ordered according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and that all, therefore, who do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> do not offend against His government. And the same distinction holds in regard to <q><a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>.</q> When we say that <q>the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God regulates all things,</q> we utter a great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> if we attribute to that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> nothing but what is just and right. But if we ascribe to the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God all things whatsoever, however <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> they may be, then it is no longer <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God regulates all things, unless we refer directly to God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> things which flow as results from His arrangements. Celsus maintains also, that <q>whatever happens in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, whether it be the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, of other <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or of heroes, is regulated by the law of the Most High God.</q> But this also is incorrect; for we cannot say that transgressors follow the law of God when they transgress; and Scripture declares that it is not only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men who are transgressors, but also <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 69</h2>

<p>And it is not we alone who speak of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but almost all who acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Thus, then, it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that all observe the law of the Most High; for all who fall away from the divine law, whether through heedlessness, or through depravity and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, or through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of what is right, all such do not keep the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but, to use a new phrase which we find in Scripture, <q>the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> I say, then, that in the opinion of most of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, some of them are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; and these, instead of keeping the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, offend against it. But, according to our belief, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of all <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, that they were not <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> originally, but they became so in departing from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way; so that the name <q><a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a></q> is given to those beings who have fallen away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Accordingly, those who worship God must not serve <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. We may also learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> if we consider the practice of those who call upon them by charms to prevent certain things, or for many other purposes. For this is the method they adopt, in order by means of incantations and magical arts to invoke the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and induce them to further their wishes. Wherefore, the worship of all <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> would be inconsistent in us who worship the Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the service of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is the service of so-called gods, for <q>all the gods of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</q>  The same thing also appears from the fact that the dedication of the most famous of the so-called sacred places, whether temples or <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, was accompanied by curious magical incantations, which were performed by those who <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> served the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> with magical arts. Hence we are determined to avoid the worship of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> even as we would avoid death; and we hold that the worship, which is supposed among the Greeks to be rendered to gods at the altars, and images, and temples, is in reality offered to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 70</h2>

<p>His next remark was, <q>Have not these inferior powers had assigned to them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> different departments, according as each was deemed worthy?</q> But this is a question which requires a very profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For we must determine whether the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who governs all things, has appointed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> for certain employments, in the same way as in states executioners are appointed, and other officers with cruel but needful duties to discharge; or whether as among <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, who infest desert places, it is customary for them to choose out of their number one who may be their leader&mdash;so the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who are scattered as it were in troops in different parts of the earth, have chosen for themselves a chief under whose command they may plunder and pillage the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men. To explain this fully, and to justify the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in refusing homage to any object except the Most High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the First-born of all creation, who is His Word and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must quote this from Scripture, <q>All that ever came before Me are thieves and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>: but the sheep did not hear them;</q> and again, <q>The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy;</q>  and other similar passages, as, <q>Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you;</q>  and again, <q>You shall tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shall you trample under feet.</q>  But of these things Celsus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing, or he would not have made use of language like this: <q>Is not everything which happens in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, whether it be the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, of other <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or of heroes, regulated by the law of the Most High God? Have these not had assigned to them various departments of which they were severally deemed worthy? Is it not just, therefore, that he who serves God should serve those also to whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has assigned such power?</q> To which he adds, <q>It is impossible, they say, for a man to serve many masters.</q> This last point we must postpone to the next book; for this, which is the seventh book which we have written in answer to the treatise of Celsus, is already of sufficient length.</p>
