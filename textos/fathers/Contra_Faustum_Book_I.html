<h1>Contra Faustum, Book I</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">Written about the year 400. Faustus was undoubtedly the acutest, most determined and most unscrupulous opponent of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the age of Augustine. The occasion of Augustine's great writing against him was the publication of Faustus' attack on the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> Scriptures, and on the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> so far as it was at variance with <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Faustus seems to have followed in the footsteps of Adimantus, against whom Augustine had written some years before, but to have gone considerably beyond Adimantus in the recklessness of his statements. The <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, involving his birth from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, is one of the main points of attack. He makes the variations in the genealogical records of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> a ground for rejecting the whole as spurious. He supposed the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, in their present form, to be not the works of the Apostles, but rather of later Judaizing falsifiers. The entire <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> system he treats with the utmost contempt, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> the Patriarchs, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the Prophets, etc., on the ground of their private lives and their teachings. Most of the objections to the morality of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> that are now current were already familiarly used in the time of Augustine. Augustine's answers are only partially satisfactory, owing to his imperfect view of the relation of the old dispensation to the new; but in the age in which they were written they were doubtless very effective. The writing is interesting from the point of view of Biblical criticism, as well as from that of polemics against Manich&aelig;ism.&mdash; A.H.N.</span> </p>

<p><strong>Who Faustus was. Faustus's object in writing the polemical treatise that forms the basis of Augustine's reply. Augustine's remarks thereon.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> was an African by race, a citizen of Mileum; he was eloquent and clever, but had adopted the shocking tenets of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. He is mentioned in my <em>Confessions</em>,  where there is an account of my acquaintance with him. This man published a certain volume against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. A copy reached us, and was read by the brethren, who called for an answer from me, as part of the service of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which I owe to them. Now, therefore, in the name and with the help of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a>, I undertake the task, that all my readers may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that acuteness of mind and elegance of style are of no use to a man unless the Lord directs his steps.  In the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> equity of divine mercy, God often bestows His help on the slow and the feeble; while from the want of this help, the most acute and eloquent run into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> only with greater rapidity and willfulness. I will give the opinions of Faustus as if stated by himself, and mine as if in reply to him.</p>

<p>2. <em>Faustus</em> said: As the learned Adimantus, the only teacher since the sainted Manich&aelig;us deserving of our attention, has plentifully exposed and thoroughly refuted the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> and of semi-<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, I think it not amiss that you should be supplied in writing with brief and pointed replies to the captious objections of our adversaries, that when, like children of the wily serpent, they try to bewilder you with their quibbles, you may be prepared to give intelligent answers. In this way they will be kept to the subject, instead of wandering from one thing to another. And I have placed our opinions and those of our opponent over against one another, as plainly and briefly as possible, so as not to perplex the reader with a long and intricate discourse.</p>

<p>3. <em>Augustine</em> replies: You warn against semi-<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, which you say we are; but we warn against pseudo-<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, which we have shown you to be. Semi-<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> may be imperfect without being false. So, then, if the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those whom you try to mislead is imperfect, would it not be better to supply what is lacking than to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> them of what they have? It was to imperfect <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that the apostle wrote, "joying and beholding your conversation," and "the deficiency in your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."  The apostle had in view a spiritual structure, as he says elsewhere, "You are God's building;" <span class="stiki" id="note140299"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:9</a></span> and in this structure he found both a reason for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and a reason for exertion. He rejoiced to see part already finished; and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of bringing the edifice to perfection called for exertion. Imperfect <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as we are, you pursue us with the desire to pervert what you call our semi-<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>; while even those who are so deficient in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as to be unable to reply to all your sophisms, are wise enough at least to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they must not have anything at all to do with you. You look for semi-<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to deceive: we wish to prove you pseudo-<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> may learn something from your refutation, and that the less advanced may learn to avoid you. Do you call us children of the serpent? You have surely forgotten how often you have found fault with the prohibition in Paradise, and have praised the serpent for opening Adam's eyes. You have the better claim to the title which you give us. The serpent owns you as well when you blame him as when you praise him.</p>
