<h1>Contra Faustum, Book IV</h1>

<p><strong>Faustus's reasons for rejecting the Old Testament, and Augustine's animadversions thereon.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: Do I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>? If it bequeaths anything to me, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it; if not, I reject it. It would be an excess of forwardness to take the documents of others which pronounce me disinherited. Remember that the promise of Canaan in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is made to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that is, to the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, who offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and abstain from swine's flesh, and from the other animals which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> pronounces unclean, and observe <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, and the feast of unleavened bread, and other things of the same kind which the author of the Testament enjoined. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> have not adopted these observances, and no one keeps them; so that if we will not take the inheritance, we should surrender the documents. This is my first reason for rejecting the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, unless you teach me better. My second reason is, that this inheritance is such a poor fleshly thing, without any spiritual blessings, that after the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> promise of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, I think it not worth the taking.</p>

<p>2. <em>Augustine</em> replied: No one doubts that promises of temporal things are contained in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, for which reason it is called the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; or that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> and the promise of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life belong to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. But that in these temporal things were figures of future things which should be fulfilled in us upon whom the ends of the ages have come, is not my fancy, but the judgment of the apostle, when he says of such things, "These things were our examples;" and again, "These things happened to them for an example, and they are written for us on whom the ends of the ages have come." <span class="stiki" id="note140314"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:6,&nbsp;11</a></span> We receive the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, therefore, not in order to obtain the fulfillment of these promises, but to see in them predictions of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; for the Old bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the New. Whence the Lord, after He rose from the dead, and allowed His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> not only to see but to handle Him, still, lest they should <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> their mortal and fleshly senses, gave them further confirmation from the testimony of the ancient books, saying, "It was necessary that all things should be fulfilled which were written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, and in the Prophets and Psalms, concerning me." <span class="stiki" id="note140315"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;24:44</a></span> Our hope, therefore, rests not on the promise of temporal things. Nor do we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and spiritual men of these times&mdash; the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; were taken up with earthly things. For they understood, by the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, what was suitable for that time, and how God appointed all these sayings and actions as types and predictions of the future. Their great desire was for the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; but they had a personal duty to perform in those predictions, by which the new things of the future were foretold. So the life as well as the tongue of these men was prophetic. The carnal people, indeed, thought only of present blessings, though even in connection with the people there were prophecies of the future.</p>

<p>These things you do not understand, because, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said, "Unless you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, you shall not understand." <span class="stiki" id="note140316"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;7:9</a></span> For you are not instructed in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>&mdash;that is, in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If you were, you would bring forth from the treasure of the sacred Scriptures things old as well as new. For the Lord Himself says, "Therefore every scribe instructed in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like an householder who brings forth from his treasure things new and old." <span class="stiki" id="note140317"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse52">Matthew&nbsp;13:52</a></span> And so, while you profess to receive only the new promises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have retained the oldness of the flesh, adding only the novelty of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; of which novelty the apostle says, "Shun profane novelties of words, for they increase unto more ungodliness, and their speech eats like a cancer. Of whom is Hymen&aelig;us and Philetus, who concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and have overthrown the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of some." <span class="stiki" id="note140318"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:16-18</a></span> Here you see the source of your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>, in teaching that the resurrection is only of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that there will be no resurrection of the body. But how can you understand spiritual things of the inner man, who is renewed in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when in the oldness of the flesh, if you do not possess temporal things, you concoct fanciful notions about them in those images of carnal things of which the whole of your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> consists? You boast of despising as worthless the land of Canaan, which was an actual thing, and actually given to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and yet you tell of a land of light cut asunder on one side, as by a narrow wedge, by the land of the race of darkness&mdash;a thing which does not exist, and which you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> from the delusion of your minds; so that your life is not supported by having it, and your mind is wasted in desiring it. </p>
