<h1>Contra Faustum, Book IX</h1>

<p><strong>Faustus argues that if the apostles born under the old covenant could lawfully depart from it, much more can he having been born a Gentile. Augustine explains the relation of Jews and Gentiles alike to the Gospel.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: Another reason for not receiving the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is, that if it was allowable for the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who were born under it, to abandon it, much more may I, who was not born under it, be excused for not thrusting myself into it. We <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are not born <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> either. Out of the same Gentile world some are induced by the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> to become <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and some by the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> to become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. It is as if two trees, a sweet and a bitter, drew from one soil the sap which each assimilates to its own nature. The apostle passed from the bitter to the sweet; it would be <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> in me to change from the sweet to the bitter.</p>

<p>2. <em>Augustine</em> replied: You say that the apostle, in leaving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, passed from the bitter to the sweet. But the apostle himself says that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, were branches broken off, and that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, a wild olive tree, were grafted into the good olive, that is, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> stock of the Hebrews, that they might partake of the fatness of the olive. For, in warning the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> not to be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> on account of the fall of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he says: "For I speak to you <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. I magnify my office; if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them. For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? For if the first fruit be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, the lump is also <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; and if the root be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, so are the branches. And if some of the branches are broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; boast not against the branches: but if you boast, you bear not the root, but the root you. You will say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Be not high-minded, but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest He also spare not you. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness; otherwise you also shall be cut off. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again. For if you were cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? For I would not, brethren, that you should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> (lest ye should be wise in your own conceits), that blindness in part is happened to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, until the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> be come in; and so all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be saved." <span class="stiki" id="note140375"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;11:16-26</a></span> It appears from this, that you, who do not wish to be graffed into this root, though you are not broken off, like the carnal unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, remain still in the bitterness of the wild olive. Your worship of the sun and moon has the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Gentile flavor. You are none the less in the wild olive of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, because you have added thorns of a new kind, and worship along with the sun and moon a false Christ, the fabrication not of your hands, but of your perverse heart. Come, then, and be grafted into the root of the olive tree, in his return to which the apostle rejoices, after by unbelief he had been among the broken branches. He speaks of himself as set free, when he made the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> transition from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. For Christ was always preached in the olive tree, and those who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him when He came were broken off, while those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> were grafted in. These are thus warned against <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>: "Be not high-minded, but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will He spare you." And to prevent despair of those broken off, he adds: "And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again. For if you were cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree." The apostle rejoices in being delivered from the condition of a broken branch, and in being restored to the fatness of the olive tree. So you who have been broken off by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> should return and be grafted in again. Those who are still in the wild olive should separate themselves from its barrenness, and become partakers of fertility.</p>
