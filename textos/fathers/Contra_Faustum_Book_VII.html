<h1>Contra Faustum, Book VII</h1>

<p><strong>The genealogical question is again taken up and argued on both sides.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: You ask why I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the genealogy of Jesus. There are many reasons; but the principal is, that He never declares with His own lips that He had an earthly father or descent, but on the contrary, that he is not of this world, that He came forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that He descended from heaven, that He has no mother or brethren except those who do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of His Father in heaven. Besides, the framers of these genealogies do not seem to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Jesus before His birth or soon after it, so as to have the credibility of eye-witnesses of what they narrate. They became acquainted with Jesus as a young man of about thirty years of age, if it is not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> to speak of the age of a divine being. Now the question regarding a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is always whether he has seen or heard what he testifies to. But the writers of these genealogies never assert that they heard the account from Jesus Himself, nor even the fact of His birth; nor did they see Him till they came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him after his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, many years after the time of His birth. To me, therefore, and to every sensible man, it appears as foolish to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this account, as it would be to call into court a blind and deaf <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>.</p>

<p>2. <em>Augustine</em> replied: As regards what Faustus calls his principal reason for not receiving the genealogy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, a complete refutation is found in the passages formerly quoted, where Christ declares Himself to be the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, and in what we have said of the identity of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: that in His Godhead He has no earthly descent, while after the flesh He is of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, as the apostle teaches. We are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, therefore, that He came forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that He descended from heaven, and also that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a> and dwelt among men. If the words, "Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?" <span class="stiki" id="note140367"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse48">Matthew&nbsp;12:48</a></span> are quoted to show that Christ had no earthly mother or descent, it follows that we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, whom He here teaches by His own example to set no value on earthly relationship, as compared with the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, had no fathers, because Christ says to them, "Call no man father upon earth; for one is your Father, even God." <span class="stiki" id="note140368"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;23:9</a></span> What He taught them to do with reference to their fathers, He Himself first did in reference to His own mother and brethren; as in many other things He condescended to set us an example, and to go before that we might follow in His footsteps. Faustus' principal objection to the genealogy fails completely; and after the defeat of this invincible force, the rest is easily routed. He says that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> who declared Christ to be the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> are not to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, because they were not present at the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whom they joined when He had reached manhood, nor heard of it from Christ Himself. Why then do they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> John when he says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made," <span class="stiki" id="note140369"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1-5</a></span> and such passages, which they agree to, without understanding them? Where did John see this, or did he ever hear it from the Lord Himself? In whatever way John learned this, those who narrate the nativity may have learned also. Again, how do they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Lord said, "Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?" If on the authority of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, why do they not also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the mother and the brethren of Christ were seeking for Him? They <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Christ said these words, which they misunderstand, while they deny a fact resting on the same authority. Once more, if Matthew could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Christ was born, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him only in His manhood, how could Manich&aelig;us, who lived so long after, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He was not born? They will say that Manich&aelig;us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which was in him. Certainly the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> would make him speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But why not rather <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what Christ's own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> tell us, who were personally acquainted with Him, and who not only had the gift of inspiration to supply defects in their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but in a purely natural way obtained information of the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of His descent, when the event was fresh in memory? And yet he dares to call the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> deaf and blind. Why were you not deaf and blind, to prevent you from learning such profane nonsense, and dumb too, to prevent you from uttering it?</p>
