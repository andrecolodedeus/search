<h1>Contra Faustum, Book XII</h1>

<p><strong>Faustus denies that the prophets predicted Christ. Augustine proves such prediction from the New Testament, and expounds at length the principal types of Christ in the Old Testament.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: Why do I not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? Rather why do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them? On account, you will reply, of their prophecies about Christ. For my part, I have read the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with the most eager attention, and have found no such prophecies. And surely it shows a weak <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> and testimonies. Indeed, you yourselves are accustomed to teach that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is so simple and absolute as not to admit of laborious investigations. Why, then, should you destroy the simplicity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by buttressing it with evidences, and Jewish evidences too? Or if you are changing your opinion about evidences, what more trustworthy <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> could you have than God Himself testifying to His own Son when He sent Him on earth&mdash;not by a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or an interpreter&mdash;by a voice immediately from heaven: "This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him?" <span class="stiki" id="note140404"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;3:17</a></span> And again He testifies of Himself: "I came forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and have come into the world;" <span class="stiki" id="note140405"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;16:28</a></span> and in many similar passages. When the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> quarrelled with this testimony, saying "You bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of yourself, your <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>," He replied: "Although I bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of myself, my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. It is written in your law, The <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of two men is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. I am one that bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of myself, and the Father who sent me bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of me." <span class="stiki" id="note140406"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;8:13-18</a></span> He does not mention the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Again He appeals to the testimony of His own works, saying, "If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not me, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works;" <span class="stiki" id="note140407"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;10:38</a></span> not, "If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not me, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Accordingly we require no testimonies concerning our Saviour. All we look for in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and a good example, which, you are well aware, are not to be found in the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. This, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, explains your referring me at once to their predictions as a reason for believing them, without a word about their actions. This may be good policy, but it is not in harmony with the declaration of Scripture, that it is impossible to gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles. This may serve meanwhile as a brief and sufficient reply to the question, why we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. The fact that they did not prophesy of Christ is abundantly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the writings of our fathers. I shall only add this, that if the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and preached Christ, and yet lived such vicious lives, what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says of the wise men among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might be applied to them: "Though they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor were thankful; but they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened." <span class="stiki" id="note140408"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;1:21</a></span> You see the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of great things is worth little, unless the life corresponds.</p>

<p>2. <em>Augustine</em> replied: The meaning of all this is, that the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold nothing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that, if they did, their predictions are of no use to us, and they themselves did not live suitably to the dignity of such prophecies. We must therefore prove the fact of the prophecies; and their use for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and steadfastness of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and that the lives of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were in harmony with their words. In this threefold discussion, it would take a long time under the first head to quote from all the books the passages in which Christ may be shown to have been predicted. Faustus' frivolity may be met effectually by the weight of one great authority. Although Faustus does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, he professes to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Above, as if to satisfy the doubts of some opponent, he declares that he assuredly believes the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>.  Let us then hear what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. His words are: "<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, called to be an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, separated unto the gospel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which He had promised before by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, concerning His Son, who was made of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh." <span class="stiki" id="note140410"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;1:1-3</a></span> What more does Faustus wish? Will he maintain that the apostle is speaking of some other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and not of the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? In any case, the gospel spoken of as promised was concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who was made for Him of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh: and to this gospel the apostle says that he was separated. So that the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the gospel, which teaches that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was made of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh. Besides, there are many passages where the apostle plainly testifies in behalf of the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, with an authority by which the necks of these <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> are broken.</p>

<p>3. "I speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," says the apostle, "I lie not, my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bearing me <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow of heart. For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ, for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: who are <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>; to whom pertains the adoption, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service and the promises; whose are the fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever." <span class="stiki" id="note140411"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;9:1-5</a></span> Here is the most abundant and express testimony and the most solemn commendation. The adoption here spoken of is evidently through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; as the apostle says to the Galatians: "In the fullness of time, God sent forth His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons." <span class="stiki" id="note140412"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4-5</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> spoken of is chiefly that of which he says in the same Epistle to the Romans: "What advantage has the Jew? Or what profit is there in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>? Much every way: chiefly, because unto them were committed the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140413"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;3:1-2</a></span> Can the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> tell us of any oracles of God committed to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> besides those of the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? And why are the covenants said to belong especially to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, but because not only was the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> given to them, but also the New was prefigured in the Old? Our opponents often display much <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> ferocity in attacking the dispensation of the law given to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, not understanding that God wishes us to be not under the law, but under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. They are here answered by the apostle himself, who, in speaking of the advantages of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, mentions this as one, that they had the giving of the law. If the law had been bad, the apostle would not have referred to it in praise of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And if Christ had not been preached by the law, the Lord Himself would not have said, "If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> me, for he wrote of me;" <span class="stiki" id="note140414"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse46">John&nbsp;5:46</a></span> nor would He have borne the testimony He did after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, saying, "All things must needs be fulfilled that were written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, and in the Prophets, and in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, concerning me." <span class="stiki" id="note140415"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;24:44</a></span> </p>

<p>4. But because the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> preach another Christ, and not Him whom the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> preached, but a false Christ of their own false contrivance, in imitation of whose <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> they themselves speak lies, though they may perhaps be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> when they are not ashamed to profess to be the followers of a deceiver, that has befallen them which the apostle asserts of the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: "When <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is read, a veil is upon their heart." Neither will this veil which keeps them from understanding <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> be taken away from them till they turn to Christ; not a Christ of their own making, but the Christ of the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For, as the apostle says, "When you shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away." <span class="stiki" id="note140416"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:15-16</a></span> We cannot wonder that they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Christ who rose from the dead, and who said, "All things must needs be fulfilled which were written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, concerning me;" for this Christ has Himself told us what <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to a hard-hearted rich man when he was in torment in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and asked <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to send some one to his brothers to teach them, that they might not come too into that place of torment. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> reply was: "They have <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, let them hear them." And when the rich man said that they would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unless some one rose from the dead, he received this most truthful answer: "If they hear not <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, neither will they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> even though one rose from the dead." <span class="stiki" id="note140417"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;16:27-31</a></span> Wherefore, the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> will not hear <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and so they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though He rose from the dead. Indeed, they do not even <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Christ rose from the dead. For how can they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He rose, when they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He died? For, again, how can they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He died, when they deny that He had a mortal body?</p>

<p>5. But we reject those false teachers whose Christ is false, or rather, whose Christ never <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. For we have a Christ <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and truthful, foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, preached by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who in innumerable places refer to the testimonies of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in support of their preaching. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in one short sentence, gives the right view of this subject. "Now," he says, "the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140418"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;3:21</a></span> What <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, if not of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to whom, as he expressly says, pertain the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the promises? And what promises, but about Christ? Elsewhere, speaking of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he says concisely: "All the promises of God are in Him yea." <span class="stiki" id="note140419"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:20</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> tells me that the giving of the law pertained to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>. He also tells me that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>. He also tells me that all the promises of God are in Christ yea. And you tell me that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> foretold nothing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Shall I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the absurdities of Manich&aelig;us relating a vain and long fable in opposition to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? Or shall I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when he forewarns us: "If any man preach to you another gospel than that which we have preached, let him be accursed?"</p>

<p>6. Our opponents may perhaps ask us to point out passages where Christ is predicted by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. One would think they might be satisfied with the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who declare that what we read in the writings of the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> was fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or with that of Christ Himself, who says that these things were written of Him. Whoever is unable to point out the passages should lay the blame on his own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and Christ and the sacred Scriptures are not chargeable with <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. However, one instance out of many may be adduced. The apostle, in the verses following the passage quoted above, says: "The word of God cannot fail. For they are not all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> which are of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; neither, because they are the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall your seed be called: that is, they which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but the children of promise are counted for the seed." <span class="stiki" id="note140420"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;9:6-8</a></span> What can our opponent say against this, in view of the declaration made to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: "In your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed?" At the time when the apostle gave the following exposition of this promise, "To <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and to his seed were the promises made. He says not, To seed, as of many, but as of one, To your seed, which is Christ," <span class="stiki" id="note140421"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse16">Galatians&nbsp;3:16</a></span> a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on this point might then have been less inexcusable, for at that time all nations had not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Christ, who is preached as of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. But now that we see the fulfillment of what we read in the ancient <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>&mdash;now that all nations are actually <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to whom it was said thousands of years ago, "In your seed shall all nations be blessed,"&mdash; it is mere obstinate folly to try to bring in another Christ, not of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, or to hold that there are no predictions of Christ in the prophetical books of the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</p>

<p>7. To enumerate all the passages in the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> referring to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a>, would exceed the limits of a volume, not to speak of the brief replies of which this treatise consists. The whole contents of these Scriptures are either directly or indirectly about Christ. Often the reference is allegorical or enigmatical, perhaps in a verbal allusion, or in a historical narrative, requiring diligence in the student, and rewarding him with the pleasure of discovery. Other passages, again, are plain; for, without the help of what is clear, we could not understand what is obscure. And even the figurative passages, when brought together, will be found so harmonious in their testimony to Christ as to put to shame the obtuseness of the sceptic.</p>

<p>8. In the creation God finished His works in six days, and rested on the seventh. The history of the world contains six periods marked by the dealings of God with men. The first period is from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>; the second, from <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; the third, from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to David; the fourth, from David to the captivity in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>; the fifth, from the captivity to the advent of lowliness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; the sixth is now in progress, and will end in the coming of the exalted Saviour to judgment. What answers to the seventh day is the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>&mdash;not in this life, but in another, where the rich man saw Lazarus at rest while he was tormented in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; where there is no evening, because there is no decay. On the sixth day, in Genesis, man is formed after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; in the sixth period of the world there is the clear discovery of our transformation in the renewing of our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, according to the image of Him who created us, as the apostle says. <span class="stiki" id="note140422"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse10">Colossians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> As a wife was made for <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> from his side while he slept, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> becomes the property of her dying Saviour, by the sacrament of the blood which flowed from His side after His death. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> made out of her husband's side is called Eve, or Life, and the mother of living beings; and the Lord says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: "Except a man eat my flesh and drink my blood, he has no life in him." <span class="stiki" id="note140423"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse53">John&nbsp;6:53</a></span> The whole narrative of Genesis, in the most minute details, is a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with reference either to the good <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> or to the bad. There is a significance in the words of the apostle when he calls Adam "the figure of Him that was to come;" <span class="stiki" id="note140424"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;5:14</a></span> and when he says, "A man shall leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>; but I speak concerning Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140425"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse31">Ephesians&nbsp;5:31-32</a></span> This points most obviously to the way in which Christ left His Father; for "though He was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant." <span class="stiki" id="note140426"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6-7</a></span> And so, too, He left His mother, the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> which cleaved to the carnality of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and was united to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> bride, that in the peace of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> they two might be one flesh. For though with the Father He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom we were made, He became in the flesh partaker of our nature, that we might become the body of which He is the head.</p>

<p>9. As Cain's <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the fruit of the ground is rejected, while Abel's <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of his sheep and the fat thereof is accepted, so the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> praising God in the harmless service of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is preferred to the earthly observances of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. For though the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were right in practising these things, they were guilty of unbelief in not distinguishing the time of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> when Christ came, from the time of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. God said to Cain, "If you offer well, yet if you divide not well, you have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>."  If Cain had <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> God when He said, "Be content, for to you shall be its reference, and you shall rule over it," he would have referred his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to himself, by taking the blame of it, and confessing it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and so assisted by supplies of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he would have ruled over his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, instead of acting as the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in killing his innocent brother. So also the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, of whom all these things are a figure, if they had been content, instead of being turbulent, and had acknowledged the time of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through the pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and heard Christ saying, "They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance;" <span class="stiki" id="note140428"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;9:12-13</a></span> and, "Every one that commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;" and, "If the Son make you free, you shall be free indeed," <span class="stiki" id="note140429"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;8:34,&nbsp;36</a></span> &mdash; they would in confession have referred their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to themselves, saying to the Physician, as it is written in the Psalm, "I said, Lord, be merciful to me; heal my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against You."  And being made free by the hope of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, they would have ruled over <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as long as it continued in their mortal body. But now, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God's righteousness, and wishing to establish a righteousness of their own, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of the works of the law, instead of being humbled on account of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, they have not been content; and in subjection to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> reigning in their mortal body, so as to make them <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> it in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof, they have stumbled on the stone of stumbling, and have been inflamed with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against him whose works they grieved to see accepted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The man who was born blind, and had been made to see, said to them, "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God hears not sinners; but if any man serve Him, and do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, him He hears;" <span class="stiki" id="note140431"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;9:31</a></span> as if he had said, God regards not the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of Cain, but he regards the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of Abel. Abel, the younger brother, is killed by the elder brother; Christ, the head of the younger people, is killed by the elder people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Abel dies in the field; Christ dies on Calvary.</p>

<p>10. God asks Cain where his brother is, not as if He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but as a judge asks a guilty criminal. Cain replies that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not, and that he is not his brother's keeper. And what answer can the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> give at this day, when we ask them with the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, of the sacred Scriptures, about Christ, except that they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Christ that we speak of? Cain's <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> was pretended, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are deceived in their refusal of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Moreover, they would have been in a sense keepers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if they had been willing to receive and keep the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For the man who keeps Christ in his heart does not ask, like Cain, Am I my brother's keeper? Then God says to Cain, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries unto me from the ground." So the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> accuses the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For the blood of Christ has a loud voice on the earth, when the responsive <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him comes from all nations. This is the voice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood, because the clear voice of the faithful redeemed by His blood is the voice of the blood itself.</p>

<p>11. Then God says to Cain: "You are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood at your hand. For you shall till the earth, and it shall no longer yield unto you its strength. A mourner and an abject shall you be on the earth." It is not, Cursed is the earth, but, Cursed are you from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood at your hand. So the unbelieving people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> is cursed from the earth, that is, from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which in the confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> has opened its mouth to receive the blood shed for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by the hand of the people that would not be under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but under the law. And this murderer is cursed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> admits and avows the curse pronounced by the apostle: "Whoever are of the works of the law are under the curse of the law." <span class="stiki" id="note140432"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse10">Galatians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> Then, after saying, Cursed are you from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood at your hand, what follows is not, For you shall till it, but, You shall till the earth, and it shall not yield to you its strength. The earth he is to till is not necessarily the same as that which opened its mouth to receive his brother's blood at his hand. From this earth he is cursed, and so he tills an earth which shall no longer yield to him its strength. That is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> admits and avows the Jewish people to be cursed, because after killing Christ they continue to till the ground of an earthly <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, an earthly <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, an earthly passover, while the hidden strength or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ, which this tilling contains, is not yielded to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> while they continue in impiety and unbelief, for it is revealed in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. While they will not turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the veil which is on their minds in reading the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is not taken away. This veil is taken away only by Christ, who does not do away with the reading of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, but with the covering which hides its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. So, at the crucifixion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the veil was rent in two, that by the passion of Christ hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> might be revealed to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> who turn to Him with a mouth opened in confession to drink His blood. In this way the Jewish people, like Cain, continue tilling the ground, in the carnal observance of the law, which does not yield to them its strength, because they do not perceive in it the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. So too, the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the ground from which by crucifying Him the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> produced our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, for He died for our offenses. But this ground did not yield to them its strength, for they were not justified by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, for He arose again for our justification. As the apostle says: "He was crucified in weakness, but He lives by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140433"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:4</a></span> This is the power of that ground which is unknown to the ungodly and unbelieving. When Christ rose, He did not appear to those who had crucified Him. So Cain was not allowed to see the strength of the ground which he tilled to sow his seed in it; as God said, "You shall till the ground, and it shall no longer yield unto you its strength."</p>

<p>12. "Groaning and trembling shall you be on the earth." Here no one can fail to see that in every land where the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are scattered they mourn for the loss of their kingdom, and are in terrified subjection to the immensely superior number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. So Cain answered, and said: "My case is worse, if You drive me out this day from the face of the earth, and from Your face shall I be hid, and I shall be a mourner and an outcast on the earth; and it shall be that every one that finds me shall slay me." Here he groans indeed in terror, lest after losing his earthly possession he should suffer the death of the body. This he calls a worse case than that of the ground not yielding to him its strength, or than that of spiritual death. For his mind is carnal; for he thinks little of being hid from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, of being under the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were it not that he may be found and slain. This is the carnal mind that tills the ground, but does not obtain its strength. To be carnally minded is death; but he, in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of this, mourns for the loss of his earthly possession, and is in terror of bodily death. But what does God reply? "Not so," He says; "but whosoever shall kill Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." That is, It is not as you say, not by bodily death shall the ungodly race of carnal <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> perish. For whoever destroys them in this way shall suffer sevenfold vengeance, that is, shall bring upon himself the sevenfold penalty under which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> lie for the crucifixion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. So to the end of the seven days of time, the continued preservation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> will be a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to believing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the subjection merited by those who, in the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of their kingdom, put the Lord to death.</p>

<p>13. "And the Lord God set a mark upon Cain, lest any one finding him should slay him." It is a most notable fact, that all the nations subjugated by Rome adopted the heathenish ceremonies of the Roman worship; while the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation, whether under Pagan or <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monarchs, has never lost the sign of their law, by which they are distinguished from all other nations and peoples. No emperor or monarch who finds under his government the people with this mark kills them, that is, makes them cease to be <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and as <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to be separate in their observances, and unlike the rest of the world. Only when a Jew comes over to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is no longer Cain, nor goes out from the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor dwells in the land of Nod, which is said to mean commotion. Against this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of commotion the Psalmist <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, "Suffer not my feet to be moved;"  and again, "Let not the hands of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> remove me;"  and, "Those that trouble me will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> when I am moved:"  and, "The Lord is at my right hand, that I should not be moved;"  and so in innumerable places. This <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> comes upon those who leave the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, His loving-kindness. Thus the Psalmist says, "I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved." But observe what follows, "Lord, by Your favor You have given strength to my <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; You hid Your face, and I was troubled;"  which teaches us that not in itself, but by participation in the light of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can any <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> possess beauty, or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, or strength. The <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> should think of this, to keep them from the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of identifying themselves with the nature and substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But they cannot think, because they are not content. The <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> of the heart they are strangers to. If they were content, as Cain was told to be, they would refer their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to themselves; that is, they would lay the blame on themselves, and not on a race of darkness that no one ever heard of, and so by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God they would prevail over their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But now the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, and all who oppose the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by their various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, leave the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, like Cain and the scattered <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and inhabit the land of commotion, that is, of carnal disquietude, instead of the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is instead of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>, which is interpreted Feasting, where Paradise was planted. But not to depart too much from the argument of this treatise I must limit myself to a few, short remarks under this head.</p>

<p>14. Omitting therefore many passages in these Books where Christ may be found, but which require longer explanation and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, although the most hidden meanings are the sweetest, convincing testimony may be obtained from the enumeration of such things as the following:&mdash; That <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, the seventh from Adam, pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was translated, as there is to be a seventh day of rest into which all will be translated who, during the sixth day of the world's history, are created anew by the incarnate Word. That <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is saved by water and wood, as the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Christ is saved by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as representing the suffering of the cross. That this ark is made of beams formed in a square, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is constructed of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> prepared unto every good work: for a square stands firm on any side. That the length is six times the breadth, and ten times the height, like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, to show that Christ appeared in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. That the breadth reaches to fifty cubits; as the apostle says, "Our heart is enlarged," <span class="stiki" id="note140439"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:11</a></span> that is, with spiritual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, of which he says again, "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our heart by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is given unto us." <span class="stiki" id="note140440"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> For in the fiftieth day after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, Christ sent His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to enlarge the hearts of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. That it is three hundred cubits long, to make up six times fifty; as there are six periods in the history of the world during which Christ has never ceased to be preached&mdash;in five foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and in the sixth proclaimed in the gospel. That it is thirty cubits high, a tenth part of the length; because Christ is our height, who in his thirtieth year gave His sanction to the doctrine of the gospel, by declaring that He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it. Now the ten commandments are to be the heart of the law; and so the length of the ark is ten times thirty. <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> himself, too, was the tenth from Adam. That the beams of the ark are fastened within and without with pitch, to signify by compact union the forbearance of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which keeps the brotherly connection from being impaired, and the bond of peace from being broken by the offenses which try the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> either from without or from within. For pitch is a glutinous substance, of great energy and force, to represent the ardor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which, with great power of endurance, bears all things in the maintenance of spiritual communion.</p>

<p>15. That all kinds of animals are inclosed in the ark; as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> contains all nations, which was also set forth in the vessel shown to Peter. That clean and unclean animals are in the ark; as good and bad take part in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. That the clean are in sevens, and the unclean in twos; not because the bad are fewer than the good, but because the good preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; and the Spirit is spoken of in Scripture as having a sevenfold operation, as being "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and might, of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140441"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;11:2-3</a></span> So also the number fifty, which is connected with the advent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, is made up of seven times seven, and one over; whence it is said, "Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." <span class="stiki" id="note140442"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;4:3</a></span> The bad, again, are in twos, as being easily divided, from their tendency to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. That <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, counting his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, was the eighth; because the hope of our resurrection has appeared in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who rose from the dead on the eighth day, that is, on the day after the seventh, or <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>. This day was the third from His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>; but in the ordinary reckoning of days, it is both the eighth and the first.</p>

<p>16. That the whole ark together is finished in a cubit above; as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the body of Christ gathered into unity, is raised to perfection. So Christ says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: "He that gathers not with me, scatters." <span class="stiki" id="note140443"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;12:30</a></span> That the entrance is on the side; as no man enters the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> except by the sacrament of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which flowed from Christ's opened side. That the lower spaces of the ark are divided into two and three chambers: as the multitude of all nations in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is divided into two, as <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and uncircumcised; or into three, as descended from the three sons of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>. And these parts of the ark are called lower, because in this earthly state there is a difference of races, and above we are completed in one. <em> Above</em> there is no diversity; for Christ is all and in all, finishing us, as it were, in one cubit above with heavenly unity.</p>

<p>17. That the flood came seven days after <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> entered the ark; as we are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the hope of the future rest, which was denoted by the seventh day. That all flesh on the face of the earth, outside the ark, was destroyed by the flood; as, beyond the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, though the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is the same, it is efficacious only for destruction, and not for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. That it rained for forty days and forty nights; as the sacrament of heavenly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> washes away all the guilt of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the ten commandments throughout all the four quarters of the world (four times ten is forty), whether that guilt has been contracted in the day of prosperity or in the night of adversity.</p>

<p>18. That <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> was five hundred years old when God told him to make the ark, and six hundred when he entered the ark; which shows that the ark was made during one hundred years, which seem to correspond to the years of an age of the world. So the sixth age is occupied with the construction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the preaching of the gospel. The man who avails himself of the offer of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is made like a square beam, fitted for every good work, and forms part of the sacred fabric. Again, it was the second month of the six hundredth year when <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> entered the ark, and in two months there are sixty days; so that here, as in every multiple of six, we have the number denoting the sixth age.</p>

<p>19. That mention is made of the twenty seventh day of the month; as we have already seen the significance of the square in the beams. Here especially it is significant; for as twenty-seven is the cube of three, there is a trinity in the means by which we are, as it were, squared, or fitted for every good work. By the memory we remember <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; by the understanding we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him; by the will we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him. That in the seventh month the ark rested; reminding us again of the seventh day of rest. And here again, to denote the perfection of those at rest, the twenty-seventh day of the month is mentioned for the second time. So what is promised in hope is realized in experience. There is here a combination of seven and eight; for the water rose fifteen cubits above the mountains, pointing to a profound <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>&mdash;the sacrament of our regeneration. For the seventh day of rest is connected with the eighth of resurrection. For when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> receive again their bodies after the rest of the intermediate state, the rest will not cease; but rather the whole man, body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united, renewed in the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> health, will attain to the realization of his hope in the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Thus the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, like the waters of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, rises above all the wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. Seven and eight are also combined in the number of one hundred and fifty, made up of seventy and eighty, which was the number of days during which the water prevailed, pointing out the deep import of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in consecrating the new man to hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of rest and resurrection.</p>

<p>20. That the raven sent out after forty days did not return, being either prevented by the water or attracted by some floating carcass; as men defiled by impure desire, and therefore eager for things outside in the world, are either <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, or are led astray into the company of those to whom, as they are outside the ark, that is, outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is destructive. That the dove when sent forth found no rest, and returned; as in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> rest is not promised to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in this world. The dove was sent forth after forty days, a period denoting the length of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. When again sent forth after seven days, denoting the sevenfold operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the dove brought back a fruitful olive branch; as some even who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if not destitute of the fatness of charity, may come after all, as it were in the evening, and be brought into the one communion by the mouth of the dove in the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of peace. That, when again sent forth after seven days, the dove did not return; as, at the end of the world, the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall no longer be in the sacrament of hope, as now, while in the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they drink what flowed from the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but in the perfection of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> safety, when the kingdom shall be delivered up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and when, in that unclouded <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we shall no longer need natural <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>.</p>

<p>21. There are many other points which we cannot take notice of even in this cursory manner. Why in the six hundred and first year of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a> life&mdash; that is, after six hundred years were completed&mdash; the covering of the ark is removed, and the hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, as it were, disclosed. Why the earth is said to have dried on the twenty-seventh day of the second month; as if the number fifty-seven denoted the completion of the rite of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For the twenty-seventh day of the second month is the fifty-seventh day of the year; and the number fifty-seven is seven times eight, which are the numbers of the spirit and the body, with one over, to denote the bond of unity. Why they leave the ark together, though they entered separately. For it is said: "<a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark;" the men and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> being spoken of separately; which denotes the time when the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh. But they go forth, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and his wife, and his sons and their wives&mdash;the men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> together. For in the end of the world, and in the resurrection of the just, the body will be united to the spirit in perfect harmony, undisturbed by the wants and the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of mortality. Why, after leaving the ark, only clean animals are offered in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though both clean and unclean were in the ark.</p>

<p>22. Then, again, it is significant that when God speaks to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and begins anew, as it were, in order, by repetition in various forms, to draw attention to the figure of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the sons of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> are blessed, and told to replenish the earth, and all animals are given to them for food; as was said to Peter of the vessel, "Kill and eat." That they are told to pour out the blood when they eat; that the former life may not be kept shut up in the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, but may be, as it were, poured out in confession. That God makes the bow, which appears in the clouds only when the sun shines, the sign of His covenant with men, and with every living thing, that He will not destroy them with a flood; as those do not perish by the flood, in separation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who in the clouds of God&mdash; that is, in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and in all the sacred Scriptures&mdash; discern the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, instead of seeking their own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. The worshippers of the sun, however, need not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves on this; for they must understand that the sun, as also a lion, a lamb, and a stone, are used as types of Christ because they have some resemblance, not because they are of the same substance.</p>

<p>23. Again, the sufferings of Christ from His own nation are evidently denoted by <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> being drunk with the wine of the vineyard he planted, and his being uncovered in his tent. For the mortality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh was uncovered, to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness; but to them that are called, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks, both <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a> and Japhet, the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. <span class="stiki" id="note140444"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:23-25</a></span> </p>

<p>Moreover, the two sons, the eldest and the youngest, carrying the garment backwards, are a figure of the two peoples, and the sacrament of the past and completed <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the Lord. They do not see the nakedness of their father, because they do not consent to Christ's death; and yet they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> it with a covering, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> whence they were born. The middle son is the Jewish people, for they neither held the first place with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> subsequently with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. They saw the nakedness of their father, because they consented to Christ's death; and they told it to their brethren outside, for what was hidden in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> was disclosed by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And thus they are the servants of their brethren. For what else is this nation now but a desk for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, bearing the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and testifying to the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in the sacrament what they disclose in the letter?</p>

<p>24. Again, every one must be impressed, and be either enlightened or confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by the blessing of the two sons who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> the nakedness of their father, though they turned away their faces, as displeased with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> done by the vine. "Blessed," he says, "be the Lord God of <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>." For although God is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all nations, even the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> acknowledge Him to be in a peculiar sense the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And how is this to be explained but by the blessing of Japhet? The occupation of all the world by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> was exactly foretold in the words: "Let God enlarge Japhet, and let him dwell in the tents of <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>." That is for the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> to attend to. You see what the state of the world actually is. The very thing that you are astonished and grieved at in us is this, that God is enlarging Japhet. Is He not dwelling in the tents of <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>?&mdash; that is, in the churches built by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Hear what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says to the believing <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: "You were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and strangers from the covenants; having no <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>, and without God in the world." In these words there is a description of the state of Japhet before he dwelt in the tents of <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>. But observe what follows: "Now then;" he says, "you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and of the household of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being built upon the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Himself being the chief corner-stone."  Here we have Japhet enlarged, and dwelling in the tents of <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>. These testimonies are taken from the epistles of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, which you yourselves acknowledge, and read, and profess to follow. You occupy an unhappy middle position in a building of which Christ is not the chief corner-stone. For you do not belong to the wall of those who, like the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, being of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Christ; nor to the wall of those who, being of the uncircumcision, like all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, are joined in the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as in the fellowship of the corner-stone. However, all who accept and read any books of our canon in which Christ is spoken of as having been born and having suffered in the flesh, and who do not unite with us in a common veiling with the sacrament of the mortality, uncovered by the passion, but without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and charity make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that from which we all are born&mdash;although they differ among themselves, whether as <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of one kind or other&mdash;are still all useful to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as being all alike servants, either in bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to or in proving some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> it is said: "There must be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, that those who are approved among you may be manifested." <span class="stiki" id="note140446"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:19</a></span> Go on, then, with your objections to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> Scriptures! Go on, you servants of Ham! You have despised the flesh from which you were born when uncovered. For you could not have called yourselves <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> unless Christ had come into the world, as foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and had drunk of His own vine that cup which could not pass from Him, and had slept in His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> of the folly which is wiser than men; and so, in the hidden counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the disclosure had been made of that infirmity of mortal flesh which is stronger than men. For unless the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> had taken on Himself this infirmity, the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, in which you also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, would not exist in the earth. Go on, then, as I have said. Declare in mockery what we may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> with reverence. Let the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> use you as her servants to make manifest those members who are approved. So particular are the predictions of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> regarding the state and the sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that we can find a place even for you in what is said of the destructive <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by which the reprobate are to perish, while the approved are to be manifested.</p>

<p>25. You say that Christ was not foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, when, in fact, their Scriptures teem with such predictions, if you would only examine them carefully, instead of treating them with levity. Who in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> leaves his country and kindred that he may become rich and prosperous among strangers, but He who, leaving the land and country of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, of whom He was born in the flesh, is now extending His power, as we see, among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>? Who in Isaac carried the wood for His own <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, but He who carried His own cross? Who is the ram for <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, caught by the horns in a. bush, but He who was fastened to the cross as an offering for us?</p>

<p>26. Who in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> striving with Jacob, on the one hand is constrained to give him a blessing, as the weaker to the stronger, the conquered to the conqueror, and on the other hand puts his thigh-bone out of joint, but He who, when He suffered the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to prevail against Him, blessed those among them who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, while the multitude, like Jacob's thigh-bone, halted in their carnality? Who is the stone placed under Jacob's head, but Christ the head of man? And in its anointing the very name of Christ is expressed, for, as all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, Christ means anointed. Christ refers to this in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and declares it to be a type of Himself, when He said of Nathanael that he was an Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile, and when Nathanael, resting his head, as it were, on this Stone, or on Christ, confessed Him as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and the King of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> anointing the Stone by his confession, in which he acknowledged Jesus to be Christ. On this occasion the Lord made appropriate mention of what Jacob saw in his dream "Verily I say unto you, You shall see heaven opened, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God ascending and descending upon the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140447"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse47">John&nbsp;1:47-51</a></span> This Jacob saw, who in the blessing was called <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, when he had the stone for a pillow, and had the vision of the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, on which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God were ascending and descending. <span class="stiki" id="note140448"><a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse11">Genesis&nbsp;28:11-18</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> denote the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, or preachers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. They ascend when they rise above the created <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> to describe the supreme majesty of the divine nature of Christ as being in the beginning God with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom all things were made. They descend to tell of His being made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law. Christ is the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, or from the carnal to the spiritual: for by His assistance the carnal ascend to spirituality; and the spiritual may be said to descend to nourish the carnal with milk when they cannot speak to them as to spiritual, but as to carnal. <span class="stiki" id="note140449"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:1-3</a></span> There is thus both an ascent and a descent upon the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is above as our head, being Himself the Saviour; and He is below in His body, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He is the ladder, for He says, "I am the way." We ascend to Him to see Him in heavenly places; we descend to Him for the nourishment of His weak members. And the ascent and descent are by Him as well as to Him. Following His example, those who preach Him not only rise to behold Him exalted, but let themselves down to give a plain announcement of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. So the apostle ascends, "Whether we be beside ourselves, it is to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;" and descends, "Whether we be sober, it is for your sake." And by whom did he ascend and descend? "For the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ constrains us: for we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all died; and that He died for all, that they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto Him that died for them, and rose again." <span class="stiki" id="note140450"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:13-15</a></span> </p>

<p>27. The man who does not find pleasure in these views of sacred Scripture is turned away to fables, because he cannot bear sound doctrine. The fables have an attraction for childish minds in people of all ages; but we who are of the body of Christ should say with the Psalmist; "O Lord, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> have spoken to me pleasing things, but they are not after Your law."  In every page of these Scriptures, while I pursue my search as a son of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in the sweat of my brow, Christ either openly or covertly meets and refreshes me. Where the discovery is laborious my ardor is increased, and the spoil obtained is eagerly devoured, and is hidden in my heart for my nourishment.</p>

<p>28. Christ appears to me in Joseph, who was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and sold by his brethren, and after his troubles obtained <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. We have seen the troubles of Christ in the world, of which <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was a figure, in the sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. And now we see the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of Christ in the same world which He subdues to Himself, in exchange for the food which He bestows. Christ appears to me in the rod of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, which became a serpent when cast on the earth as a figure of His death, which came from the serpent. Again, when caught by the tail it became a rod, as a figure of His return after the accomplishment of His work in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> to what He was before, destroying death by His new life, so as to leave no trace of the serpent. We, too, who are His body, glide along in the same mortality through the folds of time; but when at last the tail of this course of things is laid hold of by the hand of judgment that it shall go no further, we shall be renewed, and rising from the destruction of death, the last enemy, we shall be the sceptre of government in the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>29. Of the departure of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, let us hear what the apostle himself says: "I would not, brethren, that you should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and were all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the cloud and in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink of the same spiritual drink. For they drank of the spiritual rock which followed them, and that rock was Christ." <span class="stiki" id="note140452"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:1-4</a></span> The explanation of one thing is a key to the rest. For if the rock is Christ from its stability, is not the manna Christ, the living bread which came down from heaven, which gives spiritual life to those who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> feed on it? The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> died because they received the figure only in its carnal sense. The apostle, by calling it spiritual food, shows its reference to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the spiritual drink is explained by the words, "That rock was Christ," which explain the whole. Then is not the cloud and the pillar Christ, who by His uprightness and strength supports our feebleness; who shines by night and not by day, that they who see not may see, and that they who see may be made blind? In the clouds and the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> there is the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The enemies following behind perish, as past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are put away.</p>

<p>30. The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> are led through the wilderness, as those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are in the wilderness while on the way to the promised land, hoping and patiently waiting for that which they see not. In the wilderness are severe trials, lest they should in heart return to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Still Christ does not leave them; the pillar does not go away. The bitter waters are sweetened by wood, as hostile people become friendly by learning to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The twelve fountains watering the seventy palm trees are a figure of apostolic <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> watering the nations. As seven is multiplied by ten, so the decalogue is fulfilled in the sevenfold operation of the Spirit. The enemy attempting to stop them in their way is overcome by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> stretching out his hands in the figure of the cross. The deadly bites of serpents are healed by the brazen serpent, which was lifted up that they might look at it. The Lord Himself gives the explanation of this: "As <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be lifted up, that whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him may not perish, but have everlasting life." <span class="stiki" id="note140453"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;3:14</a></span> So in many other things we may find a protest against the obstinacy of unbelieving hearts. In the passover a lamb is killed, representing Christ, of whom it is said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, "Behold the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world!" <span class="stiki" id="note140454"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> In the passover the bones of the lamb were not to be broken; and on the cross the bones of the Lord were not broken. The <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, in reference to this, quotes the words, "A bone of Him shall not be broken." <span class="stiki" id="note140455"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;19:36</a></span> The posts were marked with blood to keep away destruction, as people are marked on their foreheads with the sign of the Lord's passion for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The law was given on the fiftieth day after the passover; so the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> came on the fiftieth day after the passion of the Lord. The law is said to have been written with the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the Lord says of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, "With the finger of God I cast out devils." <span class="stiki" id="note140456"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;11:20</a></span> Such are the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> in which Faustus, after shutting his eyes, declares that he can see no prediction of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But we need not wonder that he should have eyes to read and yet no heart to understand, since, instead of knocking in devout <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at the door of the heavenly secret, he dares to act in profane hostility. So let it be, for so it ought to be. Let the gate of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> be shut to the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. The meek, to whom God teaches His ways, will find all these things in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and those things which he does not see he will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> from what he sees.</p>

<p>31. He will see Jesus leading the people into the land of promise; for this name was given to the leader of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, not at first, or by chance, but on account of the work to which he was called. He will see the cluster from the land of promise hanging from a wooden pole. He will see in <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, as in this perishing world, an harlot, one of those of whom the Lord says that they go before the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, putting out of her window a scarlet line <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> of blood, as confession is made with the mouth for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. He will see the walls of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, like the frail defences of the world, fall when compassed seven times by the ark of the covenant; as now in the course of the seven days of time the covenant of God compasses the whole globe, that in the end, death, the last enemy, may be destroyed, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, like one single house, be saved from the destruction of the ungodly, purified from the defilement of fornication by the window of confession in the blood of remission.</p>

<p>32. He will see the times of the judges precede those of the kings, as the judgment will precede the kingdom. And under both the judges and the kings he will see Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> repeatedly prefigured in many and various ways. Who was in Samson, when he killed the lion that met him as he went to get a wife among strangers, but He who, when going to call His Church from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, said, "Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world?" <span class="stiki" id="note140457"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;16:33</a></span> What means the hive in the mouth of the slain lion, but that, as we see, the very <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the earthly kingdom  which once raged against Christ have now lost their fierceness, and have become a protection for the preaching of gospel sweetness? What is that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> boldly piercing the temples of the enemy with a wooden nail, but the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> casting down the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>? What is the fleece wet while the ground was dry, and again the fleece dry while the ground was wet, but the Hebrew nation at first possessing alone in its typical institution Christ the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the whole world was in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>? And now the whole world has this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> revealed, while the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are destitute of it.</p>

<p>33. To mention only a few things in the times of the kings, at the very outset does not the change in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> when Eli was rejected and Samuel chosen, and in the kingdom when Saul was rejected and David chosen, clearly predict the new <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and kingdom to come in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, when the old, which was a shadow of the new, was rejected? Did not David, when he ate the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">show-bread</a>, which it was not lawful for any but the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to eat, prefigure the union of the kingdom and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in one person, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>? In the separation of the ten tribes from the temple while two were left, is there not a figure of what the apostle asserts of the whole nation: "A remnant is saved by the election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."? <span class="stiki" id="note140458"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;11:5</a></span> </p>

<p>34. In the time of famine, Elijah is fed by ravens bringing bread in the morning and flesh in the evening; but the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> cannot in this perceive Christ, who, as it were, hungers for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and to whom sinners come in confession, having now the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, while in the end, that is to say in the evening of the age, they will have the resurrection of their bodies also. Elijah is sent to be fed by a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of another nation, who was going to gather two sticks before she died, denoting the two wooden beams of the cross. Her meal and oil are blessed, as the fruit and cheerfulness of charity do not diminish by expenditure, for God loves a cheerful giver. <span class="stiki" id="note140459"><a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:7</a></span> </p>

<p>35. The children that mocked Elisha by calling out Baldhead, are devoured by wild beasts, as those who in childish folly scoff at Christ crucified on Calvary are destroyed by devils. Elisha sends his servants to lay his staff on the dead body, but it does not revive; he comes himself, and lays himself exactly upon the dead body, and it revives: as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> sent the law by His servant, without any profit to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> dead in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and yet it was not sent without purpose by Him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of its being first sent. Then He Himself came, conformed Himself to us by participation in our death, and we were revived. When they were cutting down wood with axes, the iron, flying off the wood, sank to the bottom of the river, and came up again when the wood was thrown in by Elisha. So, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> bodily presence was cutting down the unfruitful trees among the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, according to the saying of John, "Behold, the axe is laid to the roots of the tree," <span class="stiki" id="note140460"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;3:10</a></span> by the death they inflicted, Christ was separated from His body, and descended to the depths of the infernal world; and then, when His body was laid in the tomb, like the wood on the water, His spirit returned, like the iron to the handle, and He rose. The reader will observe how many things of this kind are omitted for the sake of brevity.</p>

<p>36. As regards the departure to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah enjoins them to go, telling them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the people in whose land they dwell as strangers, because in their peace they would find peace, and to build houses, and plant vineyards and gardens&mdash;the figurative meaning is plain, when we consider that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, in whom is no guile, passed over in the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> with the ordinances of the gospel into the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. So the apostle, like an echo of Jeremiah, says to us, "I will first of all that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, supplications, intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and for those in authority, that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and charity; for this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved, and to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140461"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:1-4</a></span> Accordingly the basilicas of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> congregations have been built by <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> as abodes of peace, and vineyards of the faithful have been renewed, and gardens planted, where chief among the plants is the mustard tree, in whose wide-spreading branches the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, like the birds of heaven, in its soaring ambition, takes shelter. Again, in the return from captivity after seventy years, according to Jeremiah's <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and in the restoration of the temple, every believer in Christ must see a figure of our return as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> from the exile of this world to the heavenly Jerusalem, after the seven days of time have fulfilled their course. Joshua the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, after the captivity, who rebuilt the temple, was a figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> High Priest of our restoration. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Zechariah saw this Joshua in a filthy garment; and after the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who stood by to accuse him was defeated, the filthy garment was taken from him, and a dress of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> given him. So the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when the adversary is conquered in the judgment at the end of the world, will pass from the pains of exile to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of everlasting safety. This is the song of the Psalmist at the dedication of his house: "You have turned for me my mourning into <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>; You have removed my sackcloth, and girded me with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, that my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may sing praise unto You, and not be silent." </p>

<p>37. It is impossible, in a digression like this, to refer, however briefly, to all the figurative predictions of Christ which are to be found in the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Will it be said that these things happened in the regular course of things, and that it is a mere ingenious fancy to make them typical of Christ? Such an objection might come from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Pagans; but those who wish to be considered <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> must yield to the authority of the apostle when he says, "All these things happened to them for an example;" and again, "These things are our examples."  For if two men, Ishmael and Isaac, are types of the two covenants, can it be supposed that there is no significance in the vast number of particulars which have no historical or natural value? Suppose we were to see some Hebrew characters written on the wall of a noble building, should we be so foolish as to conclude that, because we cannot understand the characters, they are not intended to be read, and are mere painting, without any meaning? So, whoever with a candid mind reads all these things that are contained in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> Scriptures, must feel constrained to acknowledge that they have a meaning.</p>

<p>38. As an example of those particulars which have no meaning at all if not a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> one: Granting that it was necessary that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should be made as an help meet for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, what <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> can be assigned for her being taken from his side while he slept? Granting that an ark was required in order to escape from the flood, why should it have precisely these dimensions, and why should they be recorded for the devout study of future generations? Granting that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve the various races, why should there be seven clean and two unclean? Granting that the ark must have a door, why should it be in the side, and why should this fact be committed to writing? <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is commanded to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> his son: we may allow that this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> was required in order to make it conspicuous in all ages; we may allow, too, that it was a proper thing for the son to carry the wood instead of the aged father, and that in the end the fatal stroke was forbidden, lest the father should be left childless. But what had the shedding of the ram's blood to do with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> trial? Or if it was necessary to complete the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, was the ram any the better of being caught by the horns in a bush? The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that is to say, a rational <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, is led by the consideration of the way in which these apparently superfluous things are blended with what is necessary, first to acknowledge their significance, and then to try to discover it.</p>

<p>39. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves, who scoff at the crucified Saviour in whom we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and who consequently will not allow that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is predicted in the sayings and actions recorded in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, are compelled to come to us for an explanation of those things which, if not explained, must appear trifling and ridiculous. This led <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, a Jew of great learning, whom the Greeks speak of as rivalling <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in eloquence, to attempt to explain some things without any reference to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whom he did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. His attempt only shows the inferiority of all ingenious speculations, when made without keeping Christ in view, to whom all the predictions really point. So <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is that saying of the apostle: "When they shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away." <span class="stiki" id="note140464"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:16</a></span> For instance, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a> ark is, according to <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, a type of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, member by member: with this view, he shows that the numerical proportions agree perfectly. For there is no reason why a type of Christ should not be a type of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, too, since the Saviour of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> appeared in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, though what is typical of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is not necessarily typical of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo's</a> explanation fails, however, as regards the door in the side of the ark. He actually, for the sake of saying something, makes this door represent the lower apertures of the body. He has the hardihood to put this in words, and on paper. Indeed, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the door and could not understand the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>. Had he turned to Christ the veil would have been taken away, and he would have found the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> flowing from the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. For, according to the announcement, "They two shall be one flesh," some things in the ark which is a type of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, refer to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and some to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This contrast between the explanations which keep Christ in view, and all other ingenious perversions, is the same in every particular of all the figures in Scripture.</p>

<p>40. The Pagans, too, cannot deny our right to give a figurative meaning to both words and things, especially as we can point to the fulfillment of the types and figures. For the Pagans themselves try to find in their own fables figures of natural and religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Sometimes they give clear explanations, while at other times they disguise their meaning, and what is sacred in the temples becomes a jest in the theatres. They unite a disgraceful licentiousness to a degrading <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.</p>

<p>41. Besides this wonderful agreement between the types and the things typified, the adversary may be convinced by plain prophetic intimations, such as this: "In your seed shall all nations be blessed." This was said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note140465"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;22:18</a></span> and again to Isaac, <span class="stiki" id="note140466"><a href="../bible/gen026.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;26:4</a></span> and again to Jacob. <span class="stiki" id="note140467"><a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;28:14</a></span> Hence the significance of the words "I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob." <span class="stiki" id="note140468"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;3:6</a></span> God fulfills His promise to their seed in blessing all nations. With a like significance, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself, when he made his servant <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, told him to put his hand under his thigh; <span class="stiki" id="note140469"><a href="../bible/gen024.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;24:2</a></span> for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that thence would come the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whom we have now, not the promise of blessing to all nations, but the promise fulfilled.</p>

<p>42. I should like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, or rather, it would be well not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, with what blindness of mind Faustus reads the passage where Jacob calls his sons, and says, "Assemble, that I may tell you the things that are to happen in the last day. Assemble and hear, you sons of Jacob; give ear to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, your father." Surely these are the words of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. What, then, does he say of his son Judah, of whose tribe Christ came of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh, as the apostle teaches? "Judah," he says, "your brethren shall praise you: your hand shall be upon the backs of your enemies; the sons of your father shall bow down to you. Judah is a lion's cub; my son and offspring: bowing down, you have gone up: you sleep as a lion, and as a young lion, who will rouse him up? A prince shall not depart from Judah, nor a leader from his loins, till those things come which have been laid up for him. He also is the desire of nations: binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt with sackcloth, he shall wash his garment in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: his eyes are bright with wine, and his teeth whiter than milk."  There is no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> or obscurity in these words when we read them in the clear light of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. We see His brethren the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and all His joint-heirs praising Him, seeking, not their own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but His. We see His hands on the backs of His enemies, who are bent and bowed to the earth by the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities in spite of their opposition. We see Him worshipped by the sons of Jacob, the remnant saved according to the election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Christ, who was born as an infant, is the lion's cub, as it is added, My son and offspring, to show why this whelp, in whose praise it is said, "The lion's cub is stronger than the herd," <span class="stiki" id="note140471"><a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse30">Proverbs&nbsp;30:30</a></span> is even in infancy stronger than its elders. We see Christ ascending the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and bowing down when He gave up His spirit. We see Him sleeping as a lion, because in death itself He was not the conquered, but the conqueror, and as a lion's cub; for the reason of His birth and of His death was the same. And He is raised from the dead by Him whom no man has seen or can see; for the words, "Who will raise Him up?" point to an unknown power. A prince did not depart from Judah, nor a leader from his loins, till in due time those things came which had been laid up in the promise. For we learn from the authentic history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves, that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, under whom Christ was born, was their first foreign king. So the sceptre did not depart from the seed of Judah till the things laid up for him came. Then, as the promise is not only to the believing <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, it is added: "He is the desire of the nations." Christ bound His foal&mdash; that is, His people&mdash; to the vine, when He preached in sackcloth, crying, "Repent, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand." The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> made subject to Him are represented by the ass's colt, on which He also sat, leading it into Jerusalem, that is, the vision of peace teaching the meek His ways. We see Him washing His garments in wine; for He is one with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Church, which He presents to Himself, not having spot or wrinkle; to whom also it is said by Isaiah: "Though your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow." <span class="stiki" id="note140472"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;1:18</a></span> How is this done but by the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? And the wine is none other than that of which it is said that it is "shed for many, for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Christ is the cluster that hung on the pole. So it is added, "and His clothes in the blood of the grape." Again, what is said of His eyes being bright with wine, is understood by those members of His body who are enabled, in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> aberration of mind from the current of earthly things, to gaze on the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light of wisdom. So <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says in a passage quoted before: "If we be beside ourselves, it is to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Those are the eyes bright with wine. But he adds: "If we be sober, it is for your sakes." The babes needing to be fed with milk are not forgotten, as is denoted by the words, "His teeth are whiter than milk."</p>

<p>43. What can our deluded adversaries say to such plain examples, which leave no room for perverse denial, or even for sceptical uncertainty? I call on the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> to begin to inquire into these subjects, and to admit the force of these evidences, on which I have no time to dwell; nor do I wish to make a selection, in case the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> reader should think there are no others, while the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> student might blame me for the omission of many points more striking than those which occur to me at the moment. You will find many passages which require no such explanation as has been given here of Jacob's <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. For instance, every reader can understand the words, "He was led as a lamb to the slaughter," and the whole of that plain <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, "With His stripes we are healed"&mdash; "He bore our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140473"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;liii</a></span> We have a poetical gospel in the words: "They pierced my hands and feet. They have told all my bones. They look and stare upon me. They divided my garments among them, and cast lots on my vesture."  The blind even may now see the fulfillment of the words: "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord, and all kingdoms of the nations shall worship before Him." The words in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful, even unto death," "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is troubled," are a repetition of the words in the Psalm, "I slept in trouble."  And who made Him sleep? Whose voices cried, Crucify him, crucify him? The Psalm tells us: "The sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword."  But they could not prevent His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, or His ascension above the heavens, or His filling the earth with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His name; for the Psalm says: "Be Thou exalted, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, above the heavens, and let Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be above all the earth." Every one must apply these words to Christ: "The Lord said unto me, You are my Son, this day have I begotten You. Ask of me, and I will give You the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> for Your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession."  And what Jeremiah says of wisdom plainly applies to Christ: "Jacob delivered it to his son, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to his chosen one. Afterwards He appeared on earth, and conversed with men." </p>

<p>44. The same Saviour is spoken of in Daniel, where the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> appears before the Ancient of days, and receives a kingdom without end, that all nations may serve Him. <span class="stiki" id="note140479"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse13">Daniel&nbsp;7:13-14</a></span> In the passage quoted from Daniel by the Lord Himself, "When you shall see the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination of desolation</a>, spoken of by Daniel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, standing in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, let him that reads understand," <span class="stiki" id="note140480"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;24:15</a></span> the number of weeks points not only to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but to the very time of His advent. With the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who look to Christ for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> as we do, but deny that He has come and suffered, we can argue from actual events. Besides the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, now so universal, as prophesied of Christ in their own Scriptures, there are the events in the history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves. Their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place is thrown down, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> has ceased, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the ancient anointing; which was all clearly foretold by Daniel when he prophesied of the anointing of the Most Holy. <span class="stiki" id="note140481"><a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse24">Daniel&nbsp;9:24-27</a></span> Now, that all these things have taken place, we ask the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for the anointed Most Holy, and they have no answer to give. But it is from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> derive all the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they have of Christ and His advent. Why do they ask John whether he is Christ? Why do they say to the Lord, "How long do you make us to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>? If you are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, tell us plainly." Why do Peter and Andrew and Philip say to Nathanael, "We have found Messias, which is interpreted Christ," but because this name was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them from the prophecies of their Scriptures? In no other nation were the kings and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> anointed, and called Anointed or Christs. Nor could this <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> anointing be discontinued till the coming of Him who was thus prefigured. For among all their anointed ones the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> looked for one who was to save them. But in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of God they were blinded; and thinking only of the power of the Messiah, they did not understand His weakness, in which He died for us. In the book of Wisdom it is prophesied of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: "Let us condemn him to an ignominious death; for he will be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in his words. If he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, He will aid him; and deliver him from the hand of his enemies. Thus they thought, and erred; for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> blinded them." <span class="stiki" id="note140482"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse18">Wisdom&nbsp;2:18-21</a></span> These words apply also to those who, in spite of all these evidences, in spite of such a series of prophecies, and of their fulfillment, still deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is foretold in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. As often as they repeat this denial, we can produce fresh <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, with the help of Him who has made such provision against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> perversity, that <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> already given need not be repeated.</p>

<p>45. Faustus has an evasive objection, which he no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> thinks a most ingenious way of eluding the force of the clearest evidence of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, but of which one is unwilling to take any notice, because answering it may give it an appearance of importance which it does not really possess. What could be more irrational than to say that it is weak <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ without evidence? Do our adversaries, then, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in testimony about Christ? Faustus wishes us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the voice from heaven as distinguished from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> testimony. But did they hear this voice? Has not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it come to us through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> testimony? The apostle describes the transmission of this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, when he says: "How shall they call on Him on whom they have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? And how shall they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach except they be sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of them who publish peace, who bring good tidings!" <span class="stiki" id="note140483"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;10:14-15</a></span> Clearly, in the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> there was a reference to prophetic testimony. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> quoted the predictions of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, to prove the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and importance of their doctrines. For although their preaching was accompanied with the power of working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> would have been ascribed to magic, as some even now venture to insinuate, unless the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had shown that the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> was in their favor. The testimony of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who lived so long before could not be ascribed to magical arts. Perhaps the reason why Faustus will not have us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as witnesses of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ, is because he believes Persian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> about a false Christ.</p>

<p>46. According to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mind must first be nourished in simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in order that it may become capable of understanding things heavenly and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Thus it is said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: "Unless ye <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, you shall not understand."  Simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is that by which, before we attain to the height of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that we may be filled with all the fullness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that not without reason was the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humiliation, in which He was born and suffered as man, foretold so long before by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> through a prophetic race, a prophetic people, a prophetic kingdom. This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> teaches us, that in the foolishness which is wiser than men, and in the weakness which is stronger than men, is contained the hidden means of our justification and glorification. There are hid all the treasures of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which are opened to no one who despises the nourishment transmitted through the breast of his mother that is, the milk of apostolic and prophetic instruction; or who, thinking himself too old for infantile nourishment, devours <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> poison instead of the food of wisdom, for which he rashly thought himself prepared. To require simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is quite consistent with requiring <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. The very use of simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> at the outset, while the understanding of the person who speaks in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> is attained after the mind has been purified and strengthened.</p>

<p>47. But, it is said, if the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold Christ, they did not live in a way becoming their office. How can you tell whether they did or not? You are bad judges of what it is to live well or ill, whose <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in giving relief to an inanimate melon by eating it, instead of giving food to the starving beggar. It is enough for the babes in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who do not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the perfect <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the difference between the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> aimed at and that actually attained, to think of those men according to the wholesome doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that the just lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. "<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was counted to him for righteousness. For the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, preached before the gospel unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, saying, In your seed shall all nations be blessed." <span class="stiki" id="note140485"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;3:6,&nbsp;8</a></span> These are the words of the apostle. If you would, at his clear well-known voice, wake up from your unprofitable dreams, you would follow in the footsteps of our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and would be blessed, along with all nations, in his seed. For, as the apostle says, "He received the sign of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, a seal of the righteousness of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he had, yet being uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in uncircumcision; that he might be the father of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> not only to those who are of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, but also to those who follow the footsteps of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in uncircumcision." <span class="stiki" id="note140486"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;4:11-12</a></span> Since the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is thus set forth as an example to us, that we too, being justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, may have peace with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we ought to understand his manner of life, without finding fault with it; lest, by a premature separation from mother-Church, we prove abortions, instead of being brought forth in due time, when the conception has arrived at completeness.</p>

<p>48. This is a brief reply to Faustus in behalf of the character of the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. It is the reply of the babes of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, among whom I would reckon myself, inasmuch as I would not find fault with the life of the ancient <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, even if I did not understand its mystical character. Their life is proclaimed to us with approval by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in their <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, as they themselves in their <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> foretold the future <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that the two Testaments, like the seraphim, might cry to one another, "Holy, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> is the Lord God of hosts." <span class="stiki" id="note140487"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;6:3</a></span> When Faustus, instead of the vague general accusation which he makes here, condemns particular actions in the lives of the patriarchs and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the Lord their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and ours also, will assist me to reply suitably and appropriately to the separate charges.
