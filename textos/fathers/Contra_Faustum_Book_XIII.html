<h1>Contra Faustum, Book XIII</h1>

<p><strong>Faustus asserts that even if the Old Testament could be shown to contain predictions, it would be of interest only to the Jews, pagan literature subserving the same purpose for Gentiles. Augustine shows the value of prophesy for Gentiles and Jews alike.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: We are asked how we worship Christ when we reject the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who declared the promise of His advent. It is doubtful whether, on examination, it can be shown that the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold our Christ, that is, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But were it so, what does it matter to us? If these testimonies of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that you speak of were the means of converting any one from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and if he should afterwards neglect these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, he would certainly be in the wrong, and would be chargeable with ingratitude. But we are by nature <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, of the uncircumcision; as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, born under another law. Those whom the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> call poets were our first religious teachers, and from them we were afterwards converted to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. We did not first become <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, so as to reach <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; but were attracted solely by the fame, and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and the wisdom of our liberator <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. If I were still in the religion of my fathers, and a preacher were to come using the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as evidence in favor of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, I should think him mad for attempting to support what is doubtful by what is still more doubtful to a Gentile of another religion altogether. He would require first to persuade me to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and then through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Christ. And to prove the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> would be necessary. For if the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? You will perhaps say that Christ and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> mutually support each other. But a Pagan, who has nothing to do with either, would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> neither the evidence of Christ to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, nor that of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If the Pagan becomes a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, he has to thank his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and nothing else. Let us, for the sake of illustration, suppose ourselves conversing with a Gentile inquirer. We tell him to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He asks for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. We refer him to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. He asks, What <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? We reply, The Hebrew. He smiles, and says that he does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them. We remind him that Christ testifies to them. He replies, laughing, that we must first make him <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The result of such a conversation is that we are silenced, and the inquirer departs, thinking us more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> than wise. Again, I say, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Church, which consists more of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> than of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, can owe nothing to Hebrew witnesses. If, as is said, any prophecies of Christ are to be found in the Sibyl,  or in Hermes,  called Trismegistus, or Orpheus, or any <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> poet, they might aid the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those who, like us, are converts from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. But the testimony of the Hebrews is useless to us before conversion, for then we cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them; and superfluous after, for we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> without them.</p>

<p>2. <em>Augustine</em> replied: After the long reply of last book, a short answer may suffice here. To one who has read that reply, it must seem insanity in Faustus to persist in denying that Christ was foretold by the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when the Hebrew nation was the only one in which the name Christ had a peculiar sacredness as applied to kings and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; in which sense it continued to be applied till the coming of Him whom those kings and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> typified. Where did the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> learn the name of Christ? If from Manich&aelig;us, it is very strange that Africans, not to speak of others, should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the Persian Manich&aelig;us, since Faustus finds fault with the Romans and Greeks, and other <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, for believing the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as belonging to another race. According to Faustus, the predictions of the Sibyl, or Orpheus, or any <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> poet, are more suitable for leading <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He forgets that none of these are read in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, whereas the voice of the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, sounding everywhere, draws swarms of people to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. When it is so evident that men are everywhere led to Christ by the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, it is great absurdity to say that those <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are not suitable for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<p>3. Christ as foretold by the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> does not please you; but this is the Christ in whom the Gentile nations <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, with whom, according to you, Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> should have no weight. They receive the gospel which, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, "God had promised before by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> of His Son, who was made of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh." <span class="stiki" id="note140491"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;1:2-3</a></span> So we read in Isaiah: "There shall be a Root of Jesse, which shall rise to reign in the nations; in Him shall the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> trust." <span class="stiki" id="note140492"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;11:10</a></span> And again: "Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call His name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note140493"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> which is, being interpreted, God with us. Nor let the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> think that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is foretold only as a man by the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; for this is what Faustus seems to insinuate when he says, "Our Christ is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>," as if the Christ of the Hebrews was not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. We can prove Christ the virgin's son of Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> to be God. For the Lord Himself teaches the carnal <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> not to think that, because He is foretold as the son of David, He is therefore no more than that. He asks: "What think ye of Christ? Whose son is He?" They reply: "Of David." Then, to remind them of the name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, God with us, He says: "How does David in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool?" <span class="stiki" id="note140494"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;22:42-44</a></span> Here, then, Christ appears as God in Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. What <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> can the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> show with the name of Christ in it?</p>

<p>4. Manich&aelig;us indeed was not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but calls himself an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, which is a shameless <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>; for it is well known that this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> began not only after <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, but after Cyprian. In all his letters Manich&aelig;us begins thus: "Manich&aelig;us, an apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." Why do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what Manich&aelig;us says of Christ? What evidence does he give of his apostleship? This very name of Christ is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us only from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who, in their application of it to their kings and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, were not individually, but nationally, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of Christ and Christ's kingdom. What right has he to use this name, who forbids you to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that he may make you the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of a false Christ, as he himself is a false and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> apostle? And if Faustus quotes as evidence in his own support some <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who, according to him, foretell Christ, how will he satisfy his supposed inquirer, who will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> either the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> or Faustus? Will he take our <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> as witnesses? Unless he can find some <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in life, he must read their writings; and these are all against him. They teach our doctrine that Christ was born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh. He cannot pretend that the writings have been tampered with, for that would be to attack the credit of his own witnesses. Or if he produces his own manuscripts of the apostolic writings, he must also obtain for them the authority of the churches founded by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves, by showing that they have been preserved and transmitted with their sanction. It will be difficult for a man to make me <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him on the evidence of writings which derive all their authority from his own word, which I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<p>5. But perhaps you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the common report about Christ. Faustus makes a feeble suggestion of this kind as a last resource, to escape being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> either to produce his worthless authorities, or to come under the power of those opposed to him. Well, if report is your authority, you should consider the consequences of trusting to such evidence. There are many bad things reported of you which you do not wish people to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Is it reasonable to make the same evidence <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> about Christ and false about yourselves? In fact, you deny the common report about Christ. For the report most widely spread, and which every one has heard repeated, is that which distinctly asserts that Christ was born of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, according to the promise made in the Hebrew Scriptures to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Isaac and Jacob: "In your seed shall all nations be blessed." You will not admit this Hebrew testimony, but you do not seem to have any other. The authority of our books, which is confirmed by the agreement of so many nations, supported by a succession of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and councils, is against you. Your books have no authority, for it is an authority maintained by only a few, and these the worshippers of an untruthful God and Christ. If they are not following the example of the beings they worship, their testimony must be against their own <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>. And, once more, common report gives a very bad account of you, and invariably asserts, in opposition to you, that Christ was of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. You did not hear the voice of the Father from heaven. You did not see the works by which Christ bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Himself. The books which tell of these things you profess to receive, that you may maintain a delusive appearance of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; but when anything is quoted against you, you say that the books have been tampered with. You quote the passage where Christ says, "If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not me, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works;" and again, "I am one that bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of myself, and the Father that sent me bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of me;" but you will not let us quote in reply such passages as these: "Search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; for in them ye think that you have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and they are they that testify of me;" "If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me, for he wrote of me;" "They have <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, let them hear them;" "If they hear not <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, neither will they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> though one rose from the dead." What have you to say for yourselves? Where is your authority? If you reject these passages of Scripture, in spite of the weighty authority in their favor, what <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> can you show? However, if you did work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, we should be on our guard against receiving their evidence in your case; for the Lord has forewarned us: "Many false Christs and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> shall arise, and shall do many signs and wonders, that they may deceive, if it were possible, the very elect: behold, I have told you before." <span class="stiki" id="note140495"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;24:24-25</a></span> This shows that the established authority of Scripture must outweigh every other; for it derives new confirmation from the progress of events which happen, as Scripture proves, in fulfillment of the predictions made so long before their occurrence.</p>

<p>6. Are, then, your doctrines so manifestly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that they require no support from <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> or from any testimony? Show us these self-evident truths, if you have anything of the kind to show. Your legends, as we have already seen, are long and silly, old wives fables for the amusement of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children. The beginning is detached from the rest, the middle is unsound, and the end is a miserable failure. If you begin with the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, invisible, incorruptible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what need was there of His fighting with the race of darkness? And as for the middle of your theory, what becomes of the incorruptibility and unchangeableness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when His members in fruits and vegetables are purified by your mastication and digestion? And for the end, is it just that the wretched <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be punished with lasting confinement in the mass of darkness, because its God is unable to cleanse it of the defilement contracted from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> external to itself in the fulfillment of His own commission? You are at a loss for a reply. See the worthlessness of your boasted manuscripts, numerous and valuable as you say they are! Alas for the toils of the antiquaries! Alas for the property of the unhappy owners! Alas for the food of the deluded followers! Destitute as you are of Scripture authority, of the power of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, of moral excellence, and of sound doctrine, depart ashamed, and return penitent, confessing that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ, who is the Saviour of all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, whose name and whose Church are now displayed as they were of old foretold, not by some being issuing from subterranean darkness, but by a nation in a distinct kingdom established for this purpose, that there those things might be figuratively predicted of Christ which are now in reality fulfilled, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> might foretell in writing what the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> now exhibit in their preaching.</p>

<p>7. Let us suppose, then, a conversation with a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> inquirer, in which Faustus described us as making a poor appearance, though his own appearance was much more deplorable. If we say to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, Believe in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, on his asking for evidence, produce the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, if he says that he does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, because they are Hebrew and he is a Gentile, we can prove the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> from the actual fulfillment of their prophecies. He could scarcely be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> suffered by the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from the kings of this world; or if he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, he could be informed from history and the records of imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. But this is what we find foretold long ago by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, "Why do the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> rage, and the people <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the princes take counsel together against the Lord, and against His Christ." The rest of the Psalm shows that this is not said of David. For what follows might convince the most stubborn unbeliever: "The Lord said unto me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten You. Ask of me, and I will give You the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> for Your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Your possession."  This never happened to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whose king, David was, but is now plainly fulfilled in the subjection of all nations to the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This and many similar prophecies, which it would take too long to quote, would surely impress the mind of the inquirer. He would see these very kings of the earth now happily subdued by Christ, and all nations serving Him; and he would hear the words of the Psalm in which this was so long before predicted: "All the kings of the earth shall bow down to Him; all nations shall serve Him."  And if he were to read the whole of that Psalm, which is figuratively applied to Solomon, he would find that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> King of peace, for Solomon means peaceful; and he would find many things in the Psalm applicable to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which have no reference at all to the literal King Solomon. Then there is that other Psalm where God is spoken of as anointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the very word anointed pointing to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, showing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for God is represented as being anointed.  In reading what is said in this Psalm of Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he would find that what is there foretold is fulfilled in the present state of the world. He would see the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the nations perishing from off the earth, and he would find that this is predicted by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as in Jeremiah, "Then shall you say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth, and from under heaven;" <span class="stiki" id="note140499"><a href="../bible/jer010.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;10:11</a></span> and again, "O Lord, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> shall come unto You from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit. Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods? Therefore, behold, I will at that time <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> mine hand and my might; and they shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the Lord." <span class="stiki" id="note140500"><a href="../bible/jer016.htm#verse19">Jeremiah&nbsp;16:19-21</a></span> Hearing these prophecies, and seeing their actual fulfillment, I need not say that he would be affected; for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by experience how the hearts of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are confirmed by seeing ancient predictions now receiving their accomplishment.</p>

<p>8. In the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> the inquirer would find clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not merely one of the great men that have appeared in the world. For Jeremiah goes on to say: "Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from the Lord: for he shall be like the heath in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and shall not see when good comes; but shall inhabit the parched places of the wilderness, in a <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> land not inhabited. Blessed is the man that trusts in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and whose hope the Lord is: for he shall be as a tree beside the water, that spreads out its roots by the river: he shall not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> when heat comes, but his leaf shall be green; he shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit." <span class="stiki" id="note140501"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:5-8</a></span> On hearing this curse pronounced in the figurative language of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> on him that trusts in man, and the blessing in similar style on him that trusts in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the inquirer might have doubts about our doctrine, in which we teach not only that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that our trust is not in man, but also that He is man because He took our nature. So some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> by denying Christ's humanity, while they allow His divinity. Others, again, assert His humanity, but deny His divinity, and so either become infidels or incur the guilt of trusting in man. The inquirer, then, might say that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says only that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without any reference to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; whereas, in our apostolic doctrine, Christ is not only God in whom we may safely trust, but the Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>&mdash; the man Jesus. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> explains this in the words in which he seems to check himself, and to supply the omission: "His heart," he says "is sorrowful throughout; and He is man, and who shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him?" <span class="stiki" id="note140502"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse9">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:9</a></span> He is man, in order that in the form of a servant He might heal the hard in heart, and that they might acknowledge as God Him who became man for their sakes, that their trust might be not in man, but in God-man. He is man taking the form of a servant. And who shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him? For "He was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140503"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> He is man, for "the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt among us." And who shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him? For "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God." <span class="stiki" id="note140504"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> His heart was sorrowful throughout. For even as regards His own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> His heart was sorrowful, when He said, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet have ye not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me?" "Have I been so long time with you" answers to the words "He is man," and "Have ye not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me?" to "Who shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him?" And the person is none other but He who says, "He that has seen me has seen the Father." <span class="stiki" id="note140505"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9</a></span> So that our trust is not in man, to be under the curse of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, but in God-man, that is, in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. In the form of a servant the Father is greater than He; in the form of God He is equal with the Father.</p>

<p>9. In Isaiah we read: "The <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of man shall be brought low; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. And they shall hide the workmanship of their hands in the clefts of the rocks, and in dens and caves of the earth, from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, and from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His power, when He shall arise to shake terribly the earth. For in that day a man shall cast away his <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of gold and silver, which they have made to worship, as useless and hurtful." <span class="stiki" id="note140506"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse17">Isaiah&nbsp;2:17-20</a></span> Perhaps the inquirer himself, who, as Faustus supposes, would laugh and say that he does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, has hid <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> made with hands in some cleft, or cave, or den. Or he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a friend, or neighbor, or fellow-citizen who has done this from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, who by the severe prohibition of the kings of the earth, now serving and bowing down to him, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> predicted, shakes the earth, that is, breaks the stubborn heart of worldly men. The inquirer is not likely to disbelieve the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when he finds their predictions fulfilled, perhaps in his own person.</p>

<p>10. One might rather <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that the inquirer, in the midst of such copious evidence, would say that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> composed those writings when the events described had already begun to take place, in order that those occurrences might appear to be not due to a merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> purpose, but as if divinely foretold. One might <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> this, were it not for the widely spread and widely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; that Cain, with the mark that he should not be killed by any one; that Ham, the servant of his brethren, carrying as a load the books for their instruction. From the Jewish manuscripts we prove that these things were not written by us to suit the event, but were long ago published and preserved as prophecies in the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation. These prophecies are now explained in their accomplishment: for even what is obscure in them&mdash; because these things happened to them as an example, and were written for our benefit, on whom the ends of the world have come&mdash; is now made plain; and what was hidden in the shadows of the future is now visible in the light of actual experience.</p>

<p>11. The inquirer might bring forward as a difficulty the fact that those in whose books these prophecies are found are not united with us in the gospel. But when convinced that this also is foretold, he would feel how strong the evidence is. The prophecies of the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> no one can avoid seeing, no one can pretend to be blind to them. No one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Isaiah spoke of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> when he said, "The ox <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and my people has not considered;" <span class="stiki" id="note140507"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;1:3</a></span> or again, in the words quoted by the apostle, "I have stretched out my hands all the day to a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and gainsaying people;"  and especially where he says, "God has given them the spirit of remorse, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, and should not understand,"  and many similar passages. If the inquirer objected that it was not the fault of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> if God blinded them so that they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we should try in the simplest manner possible to make him understand that this blindness is the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment of other secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We should prove that the apostle recognizes this principle when he says of some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, "God gave them up to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of their own hearts, and to a reprobate <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to do things not convenient;" <span class="stiki" id="note140510"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;1:28</a></span> and that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> themselves speak of this. For, to revert to the words of Jeremiah, "He is man, and who shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him?" lest it should be an excuse for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>&mdash;for if they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as the apostle says, "they would not have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note140511"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> &mdash; the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> goes on to show that their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> was the result of secret criminality; for he says: "I the Lord search the heart and try the reins, to give to every one according to his ways, and according to the fruits of his doings."</p>

<p>12. If the next difficulty in the mind of the inquirer arose from the divisions and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> among those called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, he would learn that this too is taken notice of by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For, as if it was natural that, after being satisfied about the blindness of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, this objection from the divisions among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should occur, Jeremiah, observing this order in his <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, immediately adds in the passage already quoted: "The partridge is clamorous, gathering what it has not brought forth, making riches without judgment." For the partridge is notoriously quarrelsome, and is often caught from its eagerness in quarreling. So the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> discuss not to find the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but with a dogged determination to gain the victory one way or another, that they may gather, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, what they have not brought forth. For those whom they lead astray are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> already born of the gospel, whom the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> profession of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> misleads. Thus they make riches not with judgment, but with inconsiderate haste. For they do not consider that the followers whom they gather as their riches are taken from the genuine original <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> society, and deprived of its benefits; and as the apostle describes these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in the words: "As Jannes and Jambres withstood <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, so they also resist the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as theirs also was." <span class="stiki" id="note140512"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:8</a></span> So the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> goes on to say of the partridge, which gathers what it has not brought forth: "In the midst of his days they shall leave him, and in the end he shall be a fool;" that is, he who at first misled people by a promising display of superior wisdom, shall be a fool, that is, shall be seen to be a fool. He will be seen when his folly is manifest to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and to those to whom he was at first a wise man he will then be a fool.</p>

<p>13. As if anticipating that the inquirer would ask next by what plain mark a young <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, not yet able to distinguish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> among so many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, might find the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since the clear fulfillment of so many predictions compelled him to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> answers this question in what follows, and teaches that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which he describes <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>, is conspicuously visible. His words are: "A <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> high throne is our sanctuary." <span class="stiki" id="note140513"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse12">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:12</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> throne is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of which the apostle says: "The temple of God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, which temple you are." <span class="stiki" id="note140514"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> The Lord also, foreseeing the conspicuousness of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a help to young <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who might be misled, says, "A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid." <span class="stiki" id="note140515"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;5:14</a></span> Since, then, a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> high throne is our sanctuary, no attention is to be paid to those who would lead us into sectarianism, saying, "Lo, here is Christ," or "Lo there." Lo here, lo there, speaks of division; but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> city is on a mountain, and the mountain is that which, as we read in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Daniel, grew from a little stone till it filled the whole earth. <span class="stiki" id="note140516"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse34">Daniel&nbsp;2:34-35</a></span> And no attention should be paid to those who, professing some hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> confined to a small number, say, Behold, He is in the chamber; behold, in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>: for a city set on an hill cannot be hid, and a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> high throne is our sanctuary.</p>

<p>14. After considering these instances of the fulfillment of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> about kings and people acting as persecutors, and then becoming <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, about the destruction of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, about the blindness of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, about their testimony to the writings which they have preserved, about the folly of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, about the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and genuine <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the inquirer would most reasonably receive the testimony of these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> about the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, if we were to begin by urging him to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> prophecies yet unfulfilled, he might <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> answer, What have I to do with these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, of whose <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> I have no evidence? But, in view of the manifest accomplishment of so many remarkable predictions, no candid person  would despise either the things which were thought worthy of being predicted in those early times with so much <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, or those who made the predictions. To none can we trust more safely, as regards either events long past or those still future, than to men whose words are supported by the evidence of so many notable predictions having been fulfilled.</p>

<p>15. If any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about God or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is taught or predicted in the Sibyl or Sibyls, or in Orpheus, or in Hermes, if there ever was such a person, or in any other <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> poets, or theologians, or sages, or <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, it may be useful for the refutation of Pagan <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but cannot lead us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in these writers. For while they spoke, because they could not help it, of the God whom we worship, they either taught their fellow-countrymen to worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or allowed them to do so without daring to protest against it. But our sacred writers, with the authority and assistance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were the means of establishing and preserving among their people a government under which <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> customs were condemned as sacrilege. If any among this people fell into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> or demon-worship, they were either punished by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, or met by the awful denunciations of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. They worshipped one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the maker of heaven and earth. They had <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>; but these <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> were prophetic, or <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> of things to come, and were to cease on the appearance of the things signified. The whole state was one great <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, with its king and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolically</a> anointed which was discontinued, not by the wish of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves, who were in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> through unbelief, but only on the coming of Him who was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, anointed with spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> above His fellows, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> King who should govern us, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Priest who should offer Himself for us. In a word, the predictions of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> ingenuity regarding Christ's coming are as different from sacred <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> as the confession of devils from the proclamation of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>16. By such arguments, which might be expanded if we were discussing with one brought up in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>, and might be supported by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> in still greater number, the inquirer whom Faustus has brought before us would certainly be led to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, unless he preferred his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. As a believer, he would be taken to be cherished in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and would be taught in due course the conduct required of him. He would see many who do not practise the required duties; but this would not shake his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even though these people should belong to the same Church and partake of the same <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as himself. He would understand that few share in the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while many partake in its outward signs; that few are united in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life, and in the gift of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> who is given to us, which is a hidden spring that no stranger can approach; and that many join in the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the sacrament, which he that eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks judgment to himself, while he who neglects to eat it shall not have life in him, <span class="stiki" id="note140517"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse54">John&nbsp;6:54</a></span> and so shall never reach <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. He will understand, too, that the good are called few as compared with the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but that as scattered over the world there are very many growing among the tares, and mixed with the chaff, till the day of harvest and of purging. As this is taught in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, so is it foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. We read, "As a lily among thorns, so is my beloved among the daughters;" <span class="stiki" id="note140518"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse2">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:2</a></span> and again, "I have dwelt in the tabernacles of Kedar; peaceful among them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> peace;"  and again, "Mark in the forehead those who sigh and cry for the iniquities of my people, which are done in the midst of them." <span class="stiki" id="note140520"><a href="../bible/eze009.htm#verse1">Ezekiel&nbsp;9:1</a></span> The inquirer would be confirmed by such passages; and being now a fellow-citizen with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and of the household of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no longer an alien from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile, would learn to utter from a guileless heart the words which follow in the passage of Jeremiah already quoted, "O Lord, the patience of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: let all that forsake You be dismayed." After speaking of the partridge that is clamorous, and gathers what it has not brought forth; and after extolling the city set on an hill which cannot be hid, to prevent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> from drawing men away from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; after the words, "A <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> high throne is our sanctuary," he seems to ask himself, What do we make of all those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men who are found mixed with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and who become more numerous as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> extends, and as all nations are united in Christ? And then follow the words, "O Lord, the patience of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." Patience is necessary to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the command, "Suffer both to grow together till the harvest." <span class="stiki" id="note140521"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;13:30</a></span> Impatience towards the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> might lead to forsaking the good, who in the strict sense are the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to forsake them would be to forsake Him. So the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> goes on to say, "Let all that forsake You be dismayed; let those who have departed to the earth be confounded." The earth is man trusting in himself, and inducing  others to trust in him. So the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> adds: "Let them be overthrown, for they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of life." This is the cry of the partridge, that it has got the fountain of life, and will give it; and so men are gathered to it, and depart from Christ, as if Christ, whose name they had professed, had not fulfilled His promise. The partridge gathers those whom it has not brought forth. And in order to do this, it declares, The <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which Christ promises is with me; I will give it. In opposition to this the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says: "Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved." So we read in the apostle, "Let no man <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in men;" <span class="stiki" id="note140522"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:21</a></span> or in the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, "You are my praise." <span class="stiki" id="note140523"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse14">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:14</a></span> Such is a specimen of instruction in apostolic and prophetic doctrine, by which a man may be built on the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</p>

<p>17. Faustus has not told us how he would prove the divinity of Christ to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, whom he makes to say: I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> neither the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in support of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor Christ in support of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. It would be absurd to suppose that such a man would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what Christ says of Himself, when he disbelieves what He says of others. For if he thinks Him unworthy of credit in one case, he must think Him so in all, or at least more so when speaking of Himself than when speaking of others. Perhaps, failing this, Faustus would read to him the Sibyls and Orpheus, and any <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> prophecies about Christ that he could find. But how could he do this, when he confesses that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> none? His words are: "If, as is said, any prophecies of Christ are to be found in the Sibyl, or in Hermes, called Trismegistus, or Orpheus, or any <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> poet." How could he read writings of which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing, and which he supposes to exist only from report, to one who will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> either the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> or Christ? What, then, would he do? Would he bring forward Manich&aelig;us as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Christ? The opposite of this is what the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> do. They take advantage of the widespread fragrance of the name of Christ to gain acceptance for Manich&aelig;us, that the edge of their poisoned cup may be sweetened with this honey. Taking hold of the promises of Christ to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that He would send the Paraclete, that is, the Comforter or Advocate, they say that this Paraclete is Manich&aelig;us, or in Manich&aelig;us, and so steal an entrance into the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> when He who was promised by Christ really came. Those who have read the canonical book called the Acts of the Apostles find a reference to Christ's promise, and an account of its fulfillment. Faustus, then, has no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to give to the inquirer. It is not likely that any one will be so infatuated as to take the authority of Manich&aelig;us when he rejects that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Would he not reply in derision, if not in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, Why do you ask me to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Persian books, when you forbid me to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Hebrew books? The <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> has no hold on the inquirer, unless he is already in some way convinced of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. When he finds him willing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then he deludes him with the representation of Christ given by Manich&aelig;us. So the partridge gathers what it has not brought forth. When will you whom he gathers leave him? When will you see him to be a fool, who tells you that Hebrew testimony is worthless in the case of unbelievers, and superfluous to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>?</p>

<p>18. If <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are to throw away all the books which have led them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, I see no reason why they should continue reading the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> itself. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, too, must be worthless to this inquirer, who, according to Faustus' pitiful supposition, rejects with ridicule the authority of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And to the believer it must be superfluous, if <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> notices of Christ are superfluous to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. And if the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> should be read by the believer, that he may not forget what he has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, so should the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that he may not forget why he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For if he forgets this his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be firm. By this principle, you should throw away the books of Manich&aelig;us, on the authority of which you already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that light&mdash; that is, God&mdash; fought with darkness, and that, in order to bind darkness, the light was first swallowed up and bound, and polluted and mangled by darkness, to be restored, and liberated, and purified, and healed by your eating, for which you are rewarded by not being condemned to the mass of darkness for ever, along with that part of the light which cannot be extricated. This fiction is sufficiently published by your practice and your words. Why do you seek for the testimony of books, and add to the embarrassment of your God by the consumption of strength in the needless task of writing manuscripts? Burn all your parchments, with their finely-ornamented binding; so you will be rid of a useless burden, and your God who suffers confinement in the volume will be set free. What a mercy it would be to the members of your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if you could boil your books and eat them! There might be a difficulty, however, from the prohibition of animal food. Then the writing must share in the impurity of the sheepskin. Indeed, you are to blame for this, for, like what you say was done in the first <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between light and darkness, you brought what was clean in the pen in contact with the uncleanness of the parchment. Or perhaps, for the sake of the colors, we may put it the other way; and so the darkness would be yours, in the ink which you brought against the light of the white pages. If these remarks irritate you, you should rather be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with yourselves for believing doctrines of which these are the necessary consequences. As for the books of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, we read them as a record of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to encourage our hope and animate our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. These books are in perfect harmony with one another; and their harmony, like the music of a heavenly trumpet, wakens us from the torpor of worldliness, and urges us on to the prize of our high calling. The apostle, after quoting from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> the words, "The reproaches of them that reproached You fell on me," goes on to speak of the benefit of reading the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: "For whatsoever things were written beforetime were written for our learning; that we, through patience and comfort of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, might have hope." <span class="stiki" id="note140524"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;15:4</a></span> If Faustus denies this, we can only say with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, "If any one shall preach to you another doctrine than that you have received, let him be accursed." <span class="stiki" id="note140525"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;1:9</a></span> </p>
