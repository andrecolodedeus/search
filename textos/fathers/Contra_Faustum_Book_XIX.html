<h1>Contra Faustum, Book XIX</h1>

<p><strong>Faustus is willing to admit that Christ may have said that He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them; but if He did, it was to pacify the Jews and in a modified sense. Augustine replies, and still further elaborates the Catholic view of prophecy and its fulfillment.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: I will grant that Christ said that he came not to destroy the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but to fulfill them. But why did Jesus say this? Was it to pacify the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who were enraged at seeing their sacred institutions trampled upon by Christ, and regarded him as a wild blasphemer, not to be listened to, much less to be followed? Or was it for our instruction as Gentile <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, that we might learn meekly and patiently to bear the yoke of commandment laid on our necks by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? You yourself can hardly suppose that Christ's words were intended to bring us under the authority of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the Hebrews. So that the other explanation which I have given of the words must be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one. Every one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were always ready to attack Christ, both with words and with actual <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Naturally, then, they would be enraged at the idea that Christ was destroying their law and their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and, to appease them, Christ might very well tell them not to think that he came to destroy the law, but that he came to fulfill it. There was no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> or deceit in this, for he used the word law in a general sense, not of any particular law.</p>

<p>2. There are three <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. One is that of the Hebrews, which the apostle calls the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death. <span class="stiki" id="note140661"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;8:2</a></span> The second is that of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which he calls the law of nature. "For the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>," he says, "do by nature the things contained in the law; and, not having the law, they are a law into themselves; who show the work of the law written on their hearts." <span class="stiki" id="note140662"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;2:14-15</a></span> The third law is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of which the apostle speaks when he says, "The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death." <span class="stiki" id="note140663"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;8:2</a></span> Since, then, there are three <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, we must carefully inquire which of the three Christ spoke of when He said that He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. In the same way, there are <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. With the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, of course, every one is acquainted. If any one is in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, let him hear what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says when writing of the Cretans to Titus: "A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of their own has said, The Cretans are always liars, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beasts, slow bellies." <span class="stiki" id="note140664"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse12">Titus&nbsp;1:12</a></span> This proves that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also had their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> also has its <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as we learn from Jesus as well as from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Jesus says: "Behold, I send unto you wise men and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and some of them you shall kill in various places." <span class="stiki" id="note140665"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;23:34</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: "The Lord Himself appointed first <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and then <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140666"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse11">Ephesians&nbsp;4:11</a></span> </p>

<p>3. As "the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>" may have three different meanings, it is uncertain in what sense the words are used by Jesus, though we may form a conjecture from what follows. For if Jesus had gone on to speak of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and the observances of the Hebrews, and had added something as a fulfillment, there could have been no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it was the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of which He said that He came not to destroy, but to fulfill them. But Christ, without any allusion to these, speaks only of commandments which date from the earliest times: "You shall not kill; You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; You shall not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>." These, it can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, were of old promulgated in the world by <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> and Seth, and the other righteous men, to whom the precepts were delivered by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of lofty rank, in order to tame the savage nature of men. From this it appears that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> spoke of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And so we find him giving a fulfillment of those precepts already quoted. "You have heard," He says, "that it was said by them of old time, You shall not kill; but I say unto you, Be not even <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>." This is the fulfillment. Again: "You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; but I say unto you, Do not <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> even." This is the fulfillment. Again: "It has been said, You shall not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; but I say unto you, Swear not." This too is the fulfillment. He thus both confirms the old precepts and supplies their defects. Where He seems to speak of some Jewish precepts, instead of fulfilling them, He substitutes for them precepts of an opposite tendency. He proceeds thus: "You have heard that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you, Whosoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also." This is not fulfillment, but destruction. Again: "It has been said, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your friend, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> your enemy; but I say unto you, Love your enemies, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for your persecutors." This too is destruction. Again: "It has been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement; but I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fornication, causes her to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and is himself an adulterer if he afterwards marries another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140667"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;5:21-44</a></span> These precepts are evidently destroyed because they are the precepts of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; while the others are fulfilled because they are the precepts of the righteous men of antiquity. If you agree to this explanation, we may allow that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said that he came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. If you disapprove of this explanation, give one of your own. Only beware of making Jesus a liar, and of making yourself a Jew, by binding yourself to fulfill the law because Christ did not destroy it.</p>

<p>4. If one of the Nazareans, or Symmachians, as they are sometimes called, were arguing with me from these words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> that he came not to destroy the law, I should find some difficulty in answering him. For it is undeniable that, at his coming, Jesus was both in body and mind subject to the influence of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Those people, moreover, whom I allude to, practise <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and keep the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and abstain from swine's flesh and such like things, according to the law, although they profess to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. They are evidently misled as well as you, by this verse in which Christ says that he came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. It would not be easy to reply to such opponents without first getting rid of this troublesome verse. But with you I have no difficulty, for you have nothing to go upon; and instead of using arguments, you seem disposed, in mere mischief, to induce me to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Christ said what you evidently do not yourself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him to have said. On the strength of this verse you accuse me of dullness and evasiveness, without yourself giving any indication of keeping the law instead of destroying it. Do you too, like a Jew or a Nazarean, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the obscene distinction of being <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>? Do you <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> yourself in the observance of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>? Can you congratulate yourself on being innocent of swine's flesh? Or can you boast of having gratified the appetite of the Deity by the blood of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of Jewish offerings? If not, why do you contend that Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it?</p>

<p>5. I give unceasing thanks to my teacher, who prevented me from falling into this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, so that I am still a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. For I, like you, from reading this verse without sufficient consideration, had almost resolved to become a Jew. And with reason; for if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, and as a vessel in order to be filled full must not be empty, but partly filled already, I concluded that no one could become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> but an Israelite, nearly filled already with the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and coming to Christ to be filled to the full extent of his capacity. I concluded, too, that in thus coming he must not destroy what he already possesses; otherwise it would be a case, not of fulfilling, but of emptying. Then it appeared that I, as a Gentile, could get nothing by coming to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for I brought nothing that he could fill up by his additions. This preparatory supply is found, on inquiry, to consist of <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, new moons, baptisms, feasts of unleavened bread, distinctions of foods, drink, and clothes, and other things, too many to specify. This, then, it appeared, was what Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill. Naturally it must appear so: for what is a law without precepts, or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> without predictions? Besides, there is that terrible curse pronounced upon those who abide not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them. <span class="stiki" id="note140668"><a href="../bible/deu027.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;27:15</a></span> With the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of this curse appearing to come from God on the one side, and with Christ on the other side, seeming, as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, to say that he came not to destroy these things, but to fulfill them, what was to prevent me from becoming a Jew? The wise instruction of Manich&aelig;us saved me from this danger.</p>

<p>6. But how can you venture to quote this verse against me? Or why should it be against me only, when it is as much against yourself? If Christ does not destroy the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, neither must <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do so. Why then do you destroy them? Do you begin to perceive that you are no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? How can you profane with all kinds of work the day pronounced sacred in the law and in all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, on which they say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the maker of the world, himself rested, without dreading the penalty of death pronounced against Sabbath-breakers, or the curse on the transgressor? How can you refuse to receive in your person the unseemly mark of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which the law and all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> declare to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>, especially in the case of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, after what was thought to be his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for does not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> proclaim that whosoever is without this mark of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> shall perish from his people? How can you neglect the appointed <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, which were made so much of both by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> under the law, and by <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? And how can you defile your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by making no distinction in foods, if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Christ came not to destroy these things, but to fulfill them? Why do you discard the annual feast of unleavened bread, and the appointed <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the lamb, which, according to the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, is to be observed for ever? Why, in a word, do you treat so lightly the new moons, the baptisms, and the feast of tabernacles, and all the other carnal ordinances of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, if Christ did not destroy them? I have therefore good reason for saying that, in order to justify your neglect of these things, you must either abandon your profession of being Christ's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, or acknowledge that Christ himself has already destroyed them; and from this acknowledgment it must follow, either that this text is spurious in which Christ is made to say that he came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, or that the words have an entirely different meaning from what you suppose.</p>

<p>7. <em>Augustine</em> replied: If you allow, in consideration of the authority of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that Christ said that He came not to destroy the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but to fulfill them, you should show the same consideration to the authority of the apostle, when he says, "All these things were our examples;" and again of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "He was not yea and nay, but in Him was yea; for all the promises of God are in Him yea;" <span class="stiki" id="note140669"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:19-20</a></span> that is, they are set forth and fulfilled in Him. In this way you will see in the clearest light both what law Christ fulfilled, and how He fulfilled it. It is a vain attempt that you make to escape by your three kinds of law and your three kinds of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. It is quite plain, and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> leaves no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on the matter, what law and what <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill. The law given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is that which by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> became <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140670"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;1:17</a></span> The law given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is that of which Christ says, "He wrote of me." <span class="stiki" id="note140671"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse46">John&nbsp;5:46</a></span> For undoubtedly this is the law which entered that the offense might abound; <span class="stiki" id="note140672"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span> words which you often <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> quote as a reproach to the law. Read what is there said of this law: "The law is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and the commandment <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and just, and good. Was then that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> made death unto me? God forbid. But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that it might appear <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wrought death in me by that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140673"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;7:12-13</a></span> The entrance of the law made the offense abound, not because the law required what was wrong, but because the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and self-confident incurred additional guilt as transgressors after their acquaintance with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and just, and good commandments of the law; so that, being thus humbled, they might learn that only by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> could they be freed from subjection to the law as transgressors, and be reconciled to the law as righteous. So the same apostle says: "For before <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was afterwards revealed. Therefore the law was our schoolmaster in Christ Jesus; but after <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> came, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."  That is, we are no longer subject to the penalty of the law, because we are set free by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Before we received in humility the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the letter was only death to us, for it required <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> which we could not render. Thus <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also says: "The letter kills, but the spirit gives life." <span class="stiki" id="note140675"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:6</a></span> Again, he says: "For if a law had been given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law; but the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has concluded all under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that the promise by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> might be given to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140676"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse21">Galatians&nbsp;3:21-22</a></span> And once more: "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> He might condemn <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." <span class="stiki" id="note140677"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;8:3-4</a></span> Here we see Christ coming not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. As the law brought the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> under the guilt of transgression, increasing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by commandments which they could not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, so the righteousness of the same law is fulfilled by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit in those who learn from Christ to be meek and lowly in heart; for Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. Moreover, because even for those who are under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> it is difficult in this mortal life perfectly to keep what is written in the law, You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>, Christ, by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of His flesh, as our Priest obtains pardon for us. And in this also He fulfills the law; for what we fail in through weakness is supplied by His perfection, who is the Head, while we are His members. Thus John says: "My little children, these things write I unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not; and if any man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we have an Advocate with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the righteous: He is the propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140678"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:1-2</a></span> </p>

<p>8. Christ also fulfilled the prophecies, because the promises of God were made good in Him. As the apostle says in the verse quoted above, "The promises of God are in Him yea." Again, he says: "Now I say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was a minister of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers." <span class="stiki" id="note140679"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;15:8</a></span> Whatever, then, was promised in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, whether expressly or in figure, whether by words or by actions, was fulfilled in Him who came not to destroy the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but to fulfill them. You do not perceive that if <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were to continue in the use of acts and observances by which things to come were prefigured, the only meaning would be that the things prefigured had not yet come. Either the thing prefigured has not come, or if it has, the figure becomes superfluous or misleading. Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do not practise some things enjoined in the Hebrews by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, this, so far from showing, as you think, that Christ did not fulfill the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, rather shows that He did. So completely did Christ fulfill what these types prefigured, that it is no longer prefigured. So the Lord Himself says: "The law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were until John." <span class="stiki" id="note140680"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;16:16</a></span> For the law which shut up transgressors in increased guilt, and to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was afterwards revealed, became <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, by whom <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> superabounded. Thus the law, which was not fulfilled in the requirement of the letter, was fulfilled in the liberty of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. In the same way, everything in the law that was prophetic of the Saviour's advent, whether in words or in typical actions, became <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. For "the law was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140681"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;1:17</a></span> At Christ's advent the kingdom of God began to be preached; for the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were until John: the law, that its transgressors might desire <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that they might foretell the Saviour. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> there have been <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> since the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Of these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: "God has set some in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, first <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, secondarily <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, thirdly teachers," and so on. <span class="stiki" id="note140682"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:28</a></span> It is not of these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that it was said, "The law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were until John," but of those who prophesied the first coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which evidently cannot be prophesied now that it has taken place.</p>

<p>9. Accordingly, when you ask why a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, my reply is, that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> precisely for this reason, that what was prefigured by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Circumcision was the type of the removal of our fleshly nature, which was fulfilled in the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and which the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> teaches us to look forward to in our own resurrection. The sacrament of the new life is not wholly discontinued, for our resurrection from the dead is still to come; but this sacrament has been improved by the substitution of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, because now a pattern of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life which is to come is afforded us in the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whereas formerly there was nothing of the kind. So, when you ask why a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not keep the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, my reply is, that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not keep the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> precisely because what was prefigured in the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> is fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For we have our <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> in Him who said, "Come unto me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest unto your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140683"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;11:28-29</a></span> </p>

<p>10. When you ask why a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not observe the distinction in food as enjoined in the law, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not observe this distinction precisely because what was thus prefigured is now fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who admits into His body, which in His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> He has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, nothing which in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct corresponds to the characteristics of the forbidden animals. When you ask, again, why a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to God of the flesh and blood of slain animals, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that it would be improper for a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to offer such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, now that what was thus prefigured has been fulfilled in Christ's offering of His own body and blood. When you ask why a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not keep the feast of unleavened bread as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not keep this feast precisely because what was thus prefigured is fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who leads us to a new life by purging out the leaven of the old life. <span class="stiki" id="note140684"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span> When you ask why a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not keep the feast of the paschal lamb, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, my reply is, that he does not keep it precisely because what was thus prefigured has been fulfilled in the sufferings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Lamb without spot. When you ask why a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not keep the feasts of the new moon appointed in the law, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that he does not keep them precisely because what was thus prefigured is fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For the feast of the new moon prefigured the new creature, of which the apostle says: "If therefore there is any new creature in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, the old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new." <span class="stiki" id="note140685"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> When you ask why a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not observe the baptisms for various kinds of uncleanness according to the law, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that he does not observe them precisely because they were figures of things to come, which Christ has fulfilled. For He came to bury us with Himself by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> into death, that as Christ rose again from the dead, so we also should walk in newness of life. <span class="stiki" id="note140686"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;6:4</a></span> When you ask why <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do not keep the feast of tabernacles, if the law is not destroyed, but fulfilled by Christ, I reply that <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are God's tabernacle, in whom, as they are united and built together in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, God condescends to dwell, so that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do not keep this feast precisely because what was thus prefigured is now fulfilled by Christ in His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>11. I touch upon these things merely in passing with the utmost brevity, rather than omit them altogether. The subjects, taken separately, have filled many large volumes, written to prove that these observances were typical of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. So it appears that all the things in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> which you think are not observed by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> because Christ destroyed the law, are in fact not observed because Christ fulfilled the law. The very intention of the observances was to prefigure Christ. Now that Christ has come, instead of its being strange or absurd that what was done to prefigure His advent should not be done any more, it is perfectly right and reasonable. The typical observances intended to prefigure the coming of Christ would be observed still, had they not been fulfilled by the coming of Christ; so far is it from being the case that our not observing them now is any <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their not being fulfilled by Christ's coming. There can be no religious society, whether the religion be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or false, without some sacrament or visible <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> to serve as a bond of union. The importance of these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> cannot be overstated, and only scoffers will treat them lightly. For if <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> requires them, it must be impiety to neglect them.</p>

<p>12. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the ungodly may partake in the visible <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of godliness, as we read that <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> received <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Such are they of whom the apostle says that "they have the form of godliness, but deny the power of it." <span class="stiki" id="note140687"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:5</a></span> The power of godliness is the end of the commandment, that is, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> out of a pure heart, and of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned. <span class="stiki" id="note140688"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:5</a></span> So the Apostle Peter, speaking of the sacrament of the ark, in which the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> was saved from the deluge, says, "So by a similar figure <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> also saves you." And lest they should rest content with the visible sacrament, by which they had the form of godliness, and should deny its power in their lives by profligate conduct, he immediately adds, "Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140689"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:21</a></span> </p>

<p>13. Thus the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which were celebrated in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the law, were types of Christ who was to come; and when Christ fulfilled them by His advent they were done away, and were done away because they were fulfilled. For Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill. And now that the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is revealed, and the children of God are called into liberty, and the yoke of bondage which was required for a carnal and stiffnecked people is taken away, other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are instituted, greater in efficacy, more beneficial in their use, easier in performance, and fewer in number.</p>

<p>14. And if the righteous men of old, who saw in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of their time the promise of a future revelation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which even then their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> enabled them to discern in the dim light of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and by which they lived, for the just can live only by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note140690"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;1:17</a></span> if, then, these righteous men of old were ready to suffer, as many actually did suffer, all trials and tortures for the sake of those typical <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which prefigured things in the future; if we praise the three children and Daniel, because they refused to be defiled by meat from the king's table, from their regard for the sacrament of their day; if we feel the strongest admiration for the Maccabees, who refused to touch food which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> lawfully use; <span class="stiki" id="note140691"><a href="../bible/2ma007.htm">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;vii</a></span> how much more should a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in our day be ready to suffer all things for Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, for Christ's <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, for Christ's sacred sign, since these are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the accomplishment of what the former <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> only pointed forward to in the future! For what is still promised to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is both clearly made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and in the Saviour Himself, the Head of the body, the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, has already been accomplished. Is not the promise of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life by resurrection from the dead? This we see fulfilled in the flesh of Him of whom it is said, that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. <span class="stiki" id="note140692"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> In former days <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was dim, for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and righteous men of those times all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and hoped for the same things, and all these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and ceremonies pointed to the future; but now we have the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to which the people were shut up under the law; <span class="stiki" id="note140693"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse23">Galatians&nbsp;3:23</a></span> and what is now promised to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in the judgment is already accomplished in the example of Him who came not to destroy the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but to fulfill them.</p>

<p>15. It is a question among the students of the sacred Scriptures, whether the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Christ before His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> and resurrection, which the righteous men of old learned by revelation or gathered from <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, had the same efficacy as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has now that Christ has suffered and risen; or whether the actual shedding of the blood of the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which was, as He Himself says, for many for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note140694"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;26:28</a></span> conferred any benefit in the way of purifying or adding to the purity of those who looked forward in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but left the world before it took place; whether, in fact, Christ's death reached to the dead, so as to effect their liberation. To discuss this question here, or to prove what has been ascertained on the subject, would take too long, besides being foreign from our present purpose.</p>

<p>16. Meanwhile it is sufficient to prove, in opposition to Faustus' <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> cavils, how greatly they mistake who conclude, from the change in signs and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, that there must be a difference in the things which were prefigured in the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of a prophetic dispensation, and which are declared to be accomplished in the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the gospel; or those, on the other hand, who think that as the things are the same, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which announce their accomplishment should not differ from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which foretold that accomplishment. For if in language the form of the verb changes in the number of letters and syllables according to the tense, as <em>done</em> signifies the past, and <em> to be done</em> the future, why should not the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> which declare Christ's death and resurrection to be accomplished, differ from those which predicted their accomplishment, as we see a difference in the form and sound of the words, past and future, suffered and to suffer, risen and to rise? For material <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> are nothing else than visible speech, which, though sacred, is changeable and transitory. For while God is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and all that is material in the sacrament, is transitory: the very word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," which must be pronounced in the consecration, is a sound which passes in a moment. The actions and sounds pass away, but their efficacy remains the same, and the spiritual gift thus communicated is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. To say, therefore, that if Christ had not destroyed the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> would continue to be observed in the congregations of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Church, is the same as to say that if Christ had not destroyed the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, He would still be predicted as about to be born, to suffer, and to rise again; whereas, in fact, it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that He did not destroy, but fulfill those things, because the prophecies of His birth, and passion, and resurrection, which were represented in these ancient <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, have ceased, and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> now observed by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> contain the announcement that He has been born, has suffered, has risen. He who came not to destroy the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but to fulfill them, by this fulfillment did away with those things which foretold the accomplishment of what is thus shown to be now accomplished. Precisely in the same way, he might substitute for the expressions, "He is to be born, is to suffer, is to rise," which were in these times appropriate, the expressions, "He has been born, has suffered, has risen," which are appropriate now that the others are accomplished, and so done away.</p>

<p>17. Corresponding to this change in words is the change which naturally took place in the substitution of new <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> instead of those of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. In the case of the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who came to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, it was by degrees that they were brought to change their customs, and to have a clear perception of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and permission was given them by the apostle to preserve their hereditary worship and belief, in which they had been born and brought up; and those who had to do with them were required to make allowance for this reluctance to accept new customs. So the apostle <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Timothy, the son of a Jewish mother and a Greek father, when they went among people of this kind; and he himself accommodated his practice to theirs, not hypocritically, but for a wise purpose. For these practices were harmless in the case of those born and brought up in them, though they were no longer required to prefigure things to come. It would have done more harm to condemn them as hurtful in the case of those to whose time it was intended that they should continue. Christ, who came to fulfill all these prophecies, found those people trained in their own religion. But in the case of those who had no such training, but were brought to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the corner-stone, from the opposite wall of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, there was no obligation to adopt Jewish customs. If, indeed, like Timothy, they chose to accommodate themselves to the views of those of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> who were still wedded to their old <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, they were free to do so. But if they supposed that their hope and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> depended on these works of the law, they were warned against them as a fatal danger. So the apostle says: "Behold, I <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> say unto you, that if you be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, Christ shall profit you nothing;" <span class="stiki" id="note140695"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse2">Galatians&nbsp;5:2</a></span> that is, if they were <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, as they were intending to be, in compliance with some corrupt teachers, who told them that without these works of the law they could not be saved. For when, chiefly through the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were coming to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as it was proper that they should come, without being burdened with Jewish observances&mdash; for those who were grown up were deterred from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of ceremonies to which they were not accustomed, especially of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; and if they who had not been trained from their birth to such observances had been made proselytes in the usual way, it would have implied that the coming of Christ still required to be predicted as a future event&mdash;when, then, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were admitted without these ceremonies, those of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, not understanding why the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were not required to adopt their customs, nor why they themselves were still allowed to retain them, began to disturb the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with carnal contentions, because the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were admitted into the people of God without being made proselytes in the usual way by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the other legal observances. Some also of the converted <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were bent on these ceremonies, from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> among whom they lived. Against these <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> often wrote, and when Peter was carried away by their hypocrisy, he corrected him with a brotherly rebuke. <span class="stiki" id="note140696"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> Afterwards, when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> met in council, decreed that these works of the law were not obligatory in the case of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note140697"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse6">Acts&nbsp;15:6-11</a></span> some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> were displeased, because they failed to understand that these observances were permissible only in those who had been trained in them before the revelation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to bring to a close the prophetic life in those who were engaged in it before the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> was fulfilled, lest by a compulsory abandonment it should seem to be condemned rather than closed; while to lay these things on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> would imply either that they were not instituted to prefigure Christ, or that Christ was still to be prefigured. The ancient people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before Christ came to fulfill the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, were required to observe all these things by which Christ was prefigured. It was freedom to those who understood the meaning of the observance, but it was bondage to those who did not. But the people in those latter times who come to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ as having already come, and suffered, and risen, in the case of those whom this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> found trained to those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, are neither required to observe them, nor prohibited from doing so; while there is a prohibition in the case of those who were not bound by the ties of custom, or by any necessity, to accommodate themselves to the practice of others, so that it might become manifest that these things were instituted to prefigure Christ, and that after His coming they were to cease, because the promises had been fulfilled. Some <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> who did not understand this were displeased with this tolerant arrangement which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> effected through the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and stubbornly insisted on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> becoming <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. These are the people of whom Faustus speaks under the name of Symmachians or Nazareans. Their number is now very small, but the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> still continues.</p>

<p>18. The <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, therefore have no ground for saying, in disparagement of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that Christ came to destroy rather than to fulfill them, because <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do not observe what is there enjoined: for the only things which they do not observe are those that prefigured Christ, and these are not observed because their fulfillment is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and what is fulfilled is no longer prefigured; the typical observances having properly come to a close in the time of those who, after being trained in such things, had come to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ as their fulfillment. Do not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> observe the precept of Scripture "Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; the Lord your God is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>;" "You shall not make unto you an image," and so on? Do make <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> not observe the precept, "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain?" Do <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> not observe the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, even in the sense of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> rest? Do <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, according to the commandment? Do <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> not abstain from fornication, and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and theft, and false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> their neighbor's wife, and from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> his property,&mdash; all of which things are written in the law? These moral precepts are distinct from typical <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: the former are fulfilled by the aid of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, the latter by the accomplishment of what they promise. Both are fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who has ever been the bestower of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is also now revealed in Him, and who now makes manifest the accomplishment of what He in former times promised; for "the law was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140698"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;1:17</a></span> Again, these things which concern the keeping of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> are fulfilled in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note140699"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> while types of the future pass away when they are accomplished. But even the types are not destroyed, but fulfilled; for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in bringing to light what the types signified, does not prove them vain or illusory.</p>

<p>19. Faustus, therefore, is wrong in supposing that the Lord Jesus fulfilled some precepts of righteous men who lived before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, such as, "You shall not kill," which Christ did not oppose, but rather confirmed by His prohibition of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and abuse; and that He destroyed some things apparently peculiar to the Hebrew law, such as, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," which Christ seems rather to abolish than to confirm, when He says, "But I say unto you, that you resist not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but if any one smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also," <span class="stiki" id="note140700"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;5:38-39</a></span> and so on. But we say that even these things which Faustus thinks Christ destroyed by enjoining the opposite, were suitable to the times of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and were not destroyed, but fulfilled by Christ.</p>

<p>20. In the first place let me ask our opponents if these ancient righteous men, <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> and Seth, whom Faustus mentions particularly, and any others who lived before <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, or even, if you choose, before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with their brother without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or said to their brother, Thou fool. If not, why may they not have taught these things as well as preached them? And if they taught these things, how can Christ be said to have fulfilled their righteousness or their teaching, any more than that of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, by adding, "But I say unto you, if any man is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother, or if he says Racha, or if he says, You fool, he shall be in danger of the judgment, or of the council, or of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a>," since these men did these very things themselves, and enjoined them upon others? Will it be said that they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of its being the duty of a righteous man to restrain his passion, and not to provoke his brother with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> abuse; or that, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, they were unable to act accordingly? In that case, they deserved the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and could not have been righteous. But no one will venture to say that in their righteousness there was such <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of duty, and such a want of self-control, as to make them liable to the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. How, then, can Christ be said to have fulfilled the law, by which these men lived by means of adding things without which they could have had no righteousness at all? Will it be said that a hasty temper and bad language are sinful only since the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while formerly such qualities of the heart and speech were allowable; as we find some institutions vary according to the times, so that what is proper at one time is improper at another, and <em><a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> versa?</em> You will not be so foolish as to make this assertion. But even were you to do so, the reply will be that, according to this idea, Christ came not to fulfill what was defective in the old law, but to institute a law which did not previously exist; if it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that with the righteous men of old it was not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to say to their brother, You fool, which Christ pronounces so sinful, that whoever does so is in danger of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. So, then, you have not succeeded in finding any law of which it can be said that Christ supplied its defect by these additions.</p>

<p>21. Will it be said that the law in these early times was incomplete as regards not committing <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, till it was completed by the Lord, who added that no one should look on a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her? This is what you imply in the way you quote the words, "You have heard that it has been said, You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: but I say unto you, Do not <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> even." "Here," you say, "is the fulfillment." But let us take the words as they stand in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, without any of your modifications, and see what character you give to those righteous men of antiquity. The words are: "You have heard that it has been said, you shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; but I say unto you, that whosoever looks on a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her, has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her already in his heart." <span class="stiki" id="note140701"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;5:27-28</a></span> In your opinion, then, <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> and Seth, and the rest, committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in their hearts; and either their heart was not the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or they committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if you dare not say this, how can you say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when He came, fulfilled the law, which was already in the time of those men complete?</p>

<p>22. As regards not swearing, in which also you say that Christ completed the law given to these righteous men of antiquity, I cannot be certain that they did not <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, for we find that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle swore. With you, swearing is still a common practice, for you <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the light, which you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as flies do; for the light of the mind which lights every man that comes into the world, as distinct from mere natural light, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of. You <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, too, by your master Manich&aelig;us, whose name in his own tongue was Manes. As the name Manes seemed to be connected with the Greek word for <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, you have changed it by adding a suffix, which only makes matters worse, by giving the new meaning of pouring forth <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. One of your own <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> told me that the name Manich&aelig;us was intended to be derived from the Greek words for pouring forth manna; for <span class="greek">&#x03C7;&#x1F73;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span> means to pour. But, as it is, you only express the idea of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> with greater emphasis. For by adding the two syllables, while you have forgotten to insert another letter in the beginning of the word, you make it not Mannich&aelig;us, but Manich&aelig;us; which must mean that he pours forth <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> in his long unprofitable discourses. Again, you often <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the Paraclete,&mdash; not the Paraclete promised and sent by Christ to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but this same madness-pourer himself. Since, then, you are constantly swearing, I should like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what sense you make Christ to have fulfilled this part of the law, which is one you mention as belonging to the earliest times. And what do you make of the oaths of the apostle? For as to your authority, it cannot weigh much with yourselves, not to speak of me or any other person. It is therefore evident that Christ's words, "I have come not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it," have not the meaning which you give them. Christ makes no reference in these words to His comments on the ancient sayings which He quotes, and of which His discourse was an explanation, but not a fulfillment.</p>

<p>23. Thus, as regards <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, which was understood to mean merely the destruction of the body, by which a man is deprived of life, the Lord explained that every <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> disposition to injure our brother is a kind of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. So John also says, "He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is a murderer." <span class="stiki" id="note140702"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:15</a></span> And as it was thought that <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> meant only the act of unlawful intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the Master showed that the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> He describes is also <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Again, because <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> is a heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either in not swearing at all or in swearing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, the Lord wished to secure us from departing from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by not swearing at all, rather than that we should be in danger of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> by being in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of swearing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>. For one who never swears is less in danger of swearing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> than one who is in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of swearing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>. So, in the discourses of the apostle which are recorded, he never used an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, lest he should ever fall unawares into <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> from being in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of swearing. In his writings, on the other hand, where he had more leisure and opportunity for caution, we find him using oaths in several places,  to teach us that there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in swearing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, but that, on account of the infirmity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, we are best preserved from <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> by not swearing at all. These considerations will also make it evident that the things which Faustus supposes to be peculiar to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> were not destroyed by Christ, as he says they were.</p>

<p>24. To take, for instance, this saying of the ancients, "You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbor, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> your enemy," how does Faustus make out that this is peculiar to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? Does not the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> speak of some men as hateful to God? <span class="stiki" id="note140704"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse30">Romans&nbsp;1:30</a></span> And, indeed, in connection with this saying, the Lord enjoins on us that we should imitate God. His words are: "That ye may be the children of your Father in heaven, who makes the sun to rise upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the good, and sends rain on the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140705"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> In one sense we must <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> our enemies, after the example of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says some men are hateful; while, at the same time, we must also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our enemies after the example of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who makes the sun to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the good, and sends rain on the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. If we understand this, we shall find that the Lord, in explaining to those who did not rightly understand the saying, You shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> your enemy, made use of it to show that they should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their enemy, which was a new idea to them. It would take too long to show the consistency of the two things here. But when the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> condemn without exception the precept, You shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> your enemy, they may easily be met with the question whether their god loves the race of darkness. Or, if we should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our enemies now, because they have a part of good, should we not also <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them as having a part of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? So even in this way it would appear that there is no opposition between the saying of ancient times, You shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> your enemy, and that of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, Love your enemies. For every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man should be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> as far as he is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; while he should be loved as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> which we rightly <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> in him is to be condemned, that by its removal the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which we rightly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in him may be amended. This is precisely the principle we maintain, that we should <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> our enemy for what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in him, that is, for his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; while we also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our enemy for that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in him, that is, for his nature as a social and rational being. The difference between us and the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> is, that we prove the man to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, not by nature, either his own or any other, but by his own will; whereas they think that a man is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the race of darkness, which, according to them, was an object of dread to God when he <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> entire, and by which also he was partly conquered, so that he cannot be entirely set free. The intention of the Lord, then, is to correct those who, from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> without understanding what was said by them of old time, You shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> your enemy, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> their fellow-men instead of only hating their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; and for this purpose He says, Love your enemies. Instead of destroying what is written about <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of enemies in the law, of which He said, "I have come not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it," He would have us learn, from the duty of loving our enemies, how it is possible in the case of one and the same person, both to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> him for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him for his nature. It is too much to expect our perverse opponents to understand this. But we can silence them, by showing that by their irrational objection they condemn their own god, of whom they cannot say that he loves the race of darkness; so that in enjoining on every one to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his enemy, they cannot quote his example. There would appear to be more <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of their enemy in the race of darkness than in the god of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>. The story is, that the race of darkness <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> the domain of light bordering on their territory, and, from a desire to possess it, formed the plan of invading it. Nor is there any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in desiring <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> goodness and blessedness. For the Lord says, "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> suffers <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and the violent take it by force." <span class="stiki" id="note140706"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;11:12</a></span> This fabulous race of darkness, then, wished to take by force the good they desired, for its beautiful and attractive appearance. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, instead of returning the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of those who wished to possess Him, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> it so as to endeavor to annihilate them. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the good in the desire to possess it, while the good <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of being defiled, I ask the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, which of these obeys the precept of the Lord, "Love your enemies"? If you insist on making these precepts opposed to one another, it will follow that your god <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> what is written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, "You shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> your enemy"; while the race of darkness <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> what is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, "Love your enemies." However, you have never succeeded in explaining the difference between the flies that fly in the day-time and the moths that fly at night; for both, according to you, belong to the race of darkness. How is it that one kind <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the light, contrary to their nature; while the other kind avoid it, and prefer the darkness from which they sprung? Strange, that filthy sewers should breed a cleaner sort than dark closets!</p>

<p>25. Nor, again, is there any opposition between that which was said by them of old time, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," and what the Lord says, "But I say unto you, that you resist not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but if any one smites you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also," and so on.  The old precept as well as the new is intended to check the vehemence of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and to curb the impetuosity of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> passion. For who will of his own accord be satisfied with a revenge equal to the injury? Do we not see men, only slightly hurt, eager for slaughter, thirsting for blood, as if they could never make their enemy suffer enough? If a man receives a blow, does he not summon his assailant, that he may be condemned in the court of law? Or if he prefers to return the blow, does he not fall upon the man with hand and heel, or perhaps with a weapon, if he can get hold of one? To put a restraint upon a revenge so <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> from its excess, the law established the principle of compensation, that the penalty should correspond to the injury inflicted. So the precept, "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," instead of being a brand to kindle a fire that was quenched, was rather a covering to prevent the fire already kindled from spreading. For there is a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> revenge due to the injured person from his assailant; so that when we pardon, we give up what we might <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> claim. Thus, in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a>, we are taught to forgive others their debts that God may forgive us our debts. There is no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in asking back a debt, though there is kindness in forgiving it. But as, in swearing, one who swears, even though <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, is in danger of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, of which one is in no danger who never swears; and while swearing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we are further from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by not swearing; so that the command not to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> is a guard against <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>: in the same way since it is sinful to wish to be revenged with an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> excess, though there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in wishing for revenge within the limits of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the man who wishes for no revenge at all is further from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> revenge. It is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to demand more than is due, though it is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to demand a debt. And the best security against the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of making an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> demand is to demand nothing, especially considering the danger of being compelled to pay the debt to Him who is indebted to none. Thus, I would explain the passage as follows: It has been said by them of old time, You shall not take <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> revenge; but I say, Take no revenge at all: here is the fulfillment. It is thus that Faustus, after quoting, "It has been said, You shall not <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>; but I say unto you, <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> not at all," adds: here is the fulfillment. I might use the same expression if I thought that by the addition of these words Christ supplied a defect in the law, and not rather that the intention of the law to prevent <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> revenge is best secured by not taking revenge at all, in the same way as the intention to prevent <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> is best secured by not swearing at all. For if "an eye for an eye" is opposed to "If any one smite you on the cheek, turn to him the other also," is there not as much opposition between "You shall perform unto the Lord your <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>," and "Swear not at all?" <span class="stiki" id="note140708"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;5:33-34</a></span> If Faustus thinks that there is not destruction, but fulfillment, in the one case, he ought to think the same of the other. For if "Swear not" is the fulfillment of "Swear <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>," why should not "Take no revenge" be the fulfillment of "Take revenge <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>"?</p>

<p>So, according to my interpretation, there is in both cases a guard against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either of false swearing or of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> revenge; though, as regards giving up the right to revenge, there is the additional consideration that, by forgiving such debts, we shall obtain the forgiveness of our debts. The old precept was required in the case of a self-willed people, to teach them not to be extravagant in their demands. Thus, when the rage eager for unrestrained vengeance, was subdued, there would be leisure for any one so disposed to consider the desirableness of having his own debt cancelled by the Lord, and so to be led by this consideration to forgive the debt of his fellow-servant.</p>

<p>26. Again, we shall find on examination, that there is no opposition between the precept of the Lord about not putting away a wife, and what was said by them of old time: "Whosoever puts away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement."  The Lord explains the intention of the law, which required a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> in every case where a wife was put away. The precept not to put away a wife is the opposite of saying that a man may <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife if he pleases; which is not what the law says. On the contrary, to prevent the wife from being put away, the law required this intermediate step, that the eagerness for separation might be checked by the writing of the bill, and the man might have time to think of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of putting away his wife; especially since, as it is said, among the Hebrews it was unlawful for any but the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> to write Hebrew: for the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> claimed the possession of superior wisdom; and if they were men of upright and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> character, their pursuits might <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> entitle them to make this claim. In requiring, therefore, that in putting away his wife, a man should give her a writing of divorcement, the design was that he should be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to have recourse to those from whom he might expect to receive a cautious interpretation of the law, and suitable advice against separation. Having no other way of getting the bill written, the man should be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to submit to their direction, and to allow of their endeavors to restore peace and harmony between him and his wife. In a case where the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> could not be overcome or checked, the bill would of course be written. A wife might with reason be put away when wise counsel failed to restore the proper feeling and affection in the mind of her husband. If the wife is not loved, she is to be put away. And that she may not be put away, it is the husband's duty to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> her. Now, while a man cannot be forced to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> against his will, he may be influenced by advice and persuasion. This was the duty of the scribe, as a wise and upright man; and the law gave him the opportunity, by requiring the husband in all cases of quarrel to go to him, to get the bill of divorcement written. No good or <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man would write the bill unless it were a case of such obstinate aversion as to make reconciliation impossible. But according to your impious notions, there can be nothing in putting away a wife; for matrimony, according to you, is a criminal indulgence. The word "matrimony" shows that a man takes a wife in order that she may become a mother, which would be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in your estimation. According to you, this would imply that part of your god is overcome and captured by the race of darkness, and bound in the fetters of flesh.</p>

<p>27. But, to explain the point in hand: If Christ, in adding the words, "But I say unto you," to the quotations He makes of ancient sayings, neither fulfilled the law of primitive times by His additions, nor destroyed the law given to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by opposite precepts, but rather paid such deference to the Hebrew law in all the quotations He made from it, as to make His own remarks chiefly explanatory of what the law stated less distinctly, or a means of securing the design intended by the law, it follows that from the words, "I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it" we are not to understand that Christ by His precepts filled up what was wanting in the law; but that what the literal command failed in doing from the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and disobedience of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, is accomplished by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in those who are brought to repentance and humility. The fulfillment is not in additional words, but in acts of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. So the apostle says "Faith works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>;" <span class="stiki" id="note140710"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> and again, He that loves another has fulfilled the law." <span class="stiki" id="note140711"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;13:8</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, by which also the righteousness of the law can be fulfilled was bestowed in its significance by Christ in His coming, through the spirit which He sent according to His promise; and therefore He said, "I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it." This is the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> in which the promise of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is made to this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; which was typified in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, suitably to the times of that dispensation. So Christ says again; "A new commandment I give unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another." <span class="stiki" id="note140712"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;13:34</a></span> </p>

<p>28. So we find in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> all or nearly all the counsels and precepts which Christ introduces with the words "But I say unto you." Against <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> it is written, "My eyes troubled because of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>;"  and again, "Better is he that conquers his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, than he that takes a city." <span class="stiki" id="note140714"><a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse32">Proverbs&nbsp;16:32</a></span> Against hard words, "The stroke of a whip makes a wound; but the stroke of the tongue breaks the bones."  Against <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in the heart, "You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> your neighbor's wife." <span class="stiki" id="note140716"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse17">Exodus&nbsp;20:17</a></span> It is not, "You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>;" but, "You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>." The apostle, in quoting this, says: "I had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, unless the law had said, You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140717"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;7:7</a></span> Regarding patience in not offering resistance, a man is praised who "gives his cheek to him that smites him, and who is filled full with reproach." <span class="stiki" id="note140718"><a href="../bible/lam003.htm#verse30">Lamentations&nbsp;3:30</a></span> Of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to enemies it is said: "If your enemy hungers, feed him; if he thirsts, give him drink." <span class="stiki" id="note140719"><a href="../bible/pro025.htm#verse21">Proverbs&nbsp;25:21</a></span> This also is quoted by the apostle. <span class="stiki" id="note140720"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;12:20</a></span> In the Psalm, too, it is said, "I was a peace maker among them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> peace;"  and in many similar passages. In connection also with our imitating God in refraining from taking revenge, and in loving even the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, there is a passage containing a full description of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this character; for it is written: "To You alone ever belongs great strength, and who can withstand the power of Your arm? For the whole world before You is as a little grain of the balance; yea, as a drop of the morning dew that falls down upon the earth. But You have mercy upon all, for You can do all things, and winkest at the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because of repentance. For You love all things that are, and abhorrest nothing which You have made; for never would     You have made anything if You had <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> it. And how could anything have endured, if it had not been Your will? Or been preserved, if not called by You? But You spare all; for they are Yours, O Lord,  You lover of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For Your good Spirit is in all things; therefore chasten them little by little that offend, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance wherein they have offended, that learning their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in You, O Lord."  Christ exhorts us to imitate this long-suffering goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who makes the sun to rise upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the good, and sends rain on the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>; that we may not be careful to revenge, but may do good to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us, and so may be perfect, even as our Father in heaven is perfect. <span class="stiki" id="note140723"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44,&nbsp;48</a></span> From another passage in these ancient books we learn that, by not exacting the vengeance due to us, we obtain the remission of our own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and that by not forgiving the debts of others, we incur the danger of being refused forgiveness when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the remission of our own debts: "He that revenges shall find vengeance from the Lord, and He will surely keep his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in remembrance. Forgive your neighbor the hurt that he has done to you; so shall your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also be forgiven when you pray. One man bears <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against another, and does he seek pardon of the Lord? He shows no mercy to a man who is like himself; and does he ask forgiveness of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? If he that is but flesh nourishes <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and asks for favor from the Lord, who will entreat for the pardon of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?" <span class="stiki" id="note140724"><a href="../bible/sir028.htm#verse1">Sirach&nbsp;28:1-5</a></span> </p>

<p>29. As regards not putting away a wife, there is no need to quote any other passage of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> than that referred to most appropriately in the Lord's reply to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> when they questioned Him on this subject. For when they asked whether it is lawful for a man to <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife for any reason, the Lord answered: "Have ye not read, that He that made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh? Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined, let no man put asunder." <span class="stiki" id="note140725"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;19:4-6</a></span> Here the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who thought that they acted according to the intention of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> in putting away their wives, are made to see from the book of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that a wife should not be put away. And, by the way, we learn here, from Christ's own declaration, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made and joined male and female; so that by denying this, the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> are guilty of opposing the gospel of Christ as well as the writings of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. And supposing their doctrine to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> made and joined male and female, we see the diabolical cunning of Faustus in finding fault with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> for dissolving marriages by granting a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, and praising Christ for strengthening the union by the precept in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Instead of this, Faustus, consistently with his own foolish and impious notions, should have praised <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> for separating what was made and joined by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and should have blamed Christ for ratifying a bond of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> workmanship. To return, let us hear the good Master explain how <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who wrote of the conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in the first union of male and female as so <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and inviolable, afterwards allowed the people to put away their wives. For when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> replied, "Why did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?" Christ said unto them, "<a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, because of the hardness of your heart, suffered you to put away your wives." <span class="stiki" id="note140726"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;19:7-8</a></span> This passage we have already explained.  The hardness must have been great indeed which could not be induced to admit the restoration of wedded <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, even though by means of the writing an opportunity was afforded for advice to be given to this effect by wise and upright men. Then the Lord quoted the same law, to show both what was enjoined on the good and what was permitted to the hard; for, from what is written of the union of male and female, He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that a wife must not be put away, and pointed out the divine authority for the union; and shows from the same Scriptures that a bill of divorcement was to be given because of the hardness of the heart, which might be subdued or might not.</p>

<p>30. Since, then, all these excellent precepts of the Lord, which Faustus tries to prove to be contrary to the old books of the Hebrews, are found in these very books, the only sense in which the Lord came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, is this, that besides the fulfillment of the prophetic types, which are set aside by their actual accomplishment, the precepts also, in which the law is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and just, and good, are fulfilled in us, not by the oldness of the letter which commands, and increases the offense of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> by the additional guilt of transgression, but by the newness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who aids us, and by the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, through the saving <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which sets us free. For, while all these sublime precepts are found in the ancient books, still the end to which they point is not there revealed; although the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men who foresaw the revelation lived in accordance with it, either veiling it in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> as suited the time, or themselves discovering the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> thus veiled.</p>

<p>31. I am disposed, after careful examination, to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether the expression so often used by the Lord, "the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>," can be found in these books. It is said, indeed, "Love wisdom, that you may reign for ever." <span class="stiki" id="note140728"><a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse22">Wisdom&nbsp;6:22</a></span> And if <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life had not been clearly made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the Lord would not have said, as He did even to the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: "Search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, for in them ye think that you have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and they are they that testify of me." <span class="stiki" id="note140729"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;5:39</a></span> And to the same effect are the words of the Psalmist: "I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord."  And again: "Enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death."  Again, we read, "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the righteous are in the hand of the Lord, and pain shall not touch them;" and immediately following: "They are in peace; and if they have suffered torture from men, their hope is full of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; and after a few trouble, they shall enjoy many rewards." <span class="stiki" id="note140732"><a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse1">Wisdom&nbsp;3:1-5</a></span> Again, in another place: "The righteous shall live for ever, and their reward is with the Lord, and their concern with the Highest; therefore shall they receive from the hand of the Lord a kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and a crown of beauty." <span class="stiki" id="note140733"><a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse16">Wisdom&nbsp;5:16-17</a></span> These and many similar declarations of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, in more or less explicit terms, are found in these writings. Even the resurrection of the body is spoken of by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, accordingly, were fierce opponents of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, who disbelieved the resurrection. This we learn not only from the canonical Acts of the Apostles, which the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> reject, because it tells of the advent of the Paraclete promised by the Lord, but also from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> question the Lord about the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who married seven brothers, one dying after the other, whose wife she would be in the resurrection. <span class="stiki" id="note140734"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;22:23-28</a></span> As regards, then, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and the resurrection of the dead, numerous testimonies are to be found in these Scriptures. But I do not find there the expression, "the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>." This expression belongs properly to the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, because in the resurrection our earthly bodies shall, by that change which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> fully describes, become spiritual bodies, and so heavenly, that thus we may possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. And this expression was reserved for Him whose advent as King to govern and Priest to sanctify His believing people, was ushered in by all the symbolism of the old covenant, in its genealogies, its typical acts and words, its <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and ceremonies and feasts, and in all its prophetic utterances and events and figures. He came full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> helping us to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the precepts, and in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> securing the accomplishment of the promises. He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it.</p>
