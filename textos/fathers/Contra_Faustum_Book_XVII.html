<h1>Contra Faustum, Book XVII</h1>

<p><strong>Faustus rejects Christ's declaration that He came not to destroy the law and the prophets but to fulfill them, on the ground that it is found only in Matthew, who was not present when the words purport to have been spoken. Augustine rebukes the folly of refusing to believe Matthew and yet believing Manich&aelig;us, and shows what the passage of scripture really means.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: You ask why we do not receive the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when Christ said that he came not to destroy them, but to fulfill them. Where do we learn that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said this? From Matthew, who declares that he said it on the mount. In whose presence was it said? In the presence of Peter, Andrew, James, and John&mdash; only these four; for the rest, including Matthew himself, were not yet chosen. Is it not the case that one of these four&mdash; John, namely&mdash; wrote a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>? It is. Does he mention this saying of Jesus? No. How, then, does it happen that what is not recorded by John, who was on the mount, is recorded by Matthew, who became a follower of Christ long after He came down from the mount? In the first place, then, we must <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether Jesus ever said these words, since the proper <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is silent on the matter, and we have only the authority of a less trustworthy <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. But, besides this, we shall find that it is not Matthew that has imposed upon us, but some one else under his name, as is evident from the indirect style of the narrative. Thus we read: "As Jesus passed by, He saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom, and called him; and he immediately rose up, and followed Him." <span class="stiki" id="note140634"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;9:9</a></span> No one writing of himself would say, He saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and called him; and he followed Him; but, He saw me, and called me, and I followed Him. Evidently this was written not by Matthew himself, but by some one else under his name. Since, then, the passage already quoted would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> even if it had been written by Matthew, since he was not present when Jesus spoke on the mount; much more is its <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> evident from the fact that the writer was not Matthew himself, but some one borrowing the names both of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and of Matthew.</p>

<p>2. The passage itself, in which Christ tells the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> not to think that He came to destroy the law, is rather designed to show that He did destroy it. For, had He not done something of the kind, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> would not have suspected Him. His words are: "Think not that I have come to destroy the law." Suppose  the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had replied, What actions of yours might lead us to suspect this? Is it because you expose <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, breakest the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, discardest <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, makest no distinction in foods? This would be the natural answer to the words, Think not. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had the best possible reason for thinking that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> destroyed the law. If this was not to destroy the law, what is? But, indeed, the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> consider themselves already so faultlessly perfect, that they have no desire to be fulfilled. Their author and father condemns adding to them as much as taking away anything from them; as we read in Deuteronomy: "These precepts which I deliver unto you this day, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, you shall observe to do; you shall not turn aside from them to the right hand or to the left; you shall not add thereto nor diminish from it, that your God may bless you." <span class="stiki" id="note140635"><a href="../bible/deu012.htm#verse32">Deuteronomy&nbsp;12:32</a></span> Whether, therefore, Jesus turned aside to the right by adding to the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in order to fulfill them, or to the left in taking away from them to destroy them, either way he offended the author of the law. So this verse must either have some other meaning, or be spurious.</p>

<p>3. <em>Augustine</em> replied: What amazing folly, to disbelieve what Matthew records of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Manich&aelig;us! If Matthew is not to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> because he was not present when Christ said, "I came not to destroy the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but to fulfill," was Manich&aelig;us present, was he even born, when Christ appeared among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? According, then, to your rule, you should not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything that Manich&aelig;us says of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. On the other hand, we refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what Manich&aelig;us says of Christ; not because he was not present as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words and actions, but because he contradicts Christ's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which rests on their authority. The apostle, speaking in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, tells us that such teachers would arise. With reference to such, he says to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>: "If any man preaches to you another gospel than that you have received, let him be accursed." <span class="stiki" id="note140636"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;1:9</a></span> If no one can say what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of Christ unless he has himself seen and heard Him, no one now can be trusted. But if <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> can now say what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of Christ because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has been handed down in word or writing by those who saw and heard, why might not Matthew have heard the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from his fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> John, if John was present and he himself was not, as from the writings of John both we who are born so long after and those who shall be born after us can learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about Christ? In this way, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> of Luke and Mark, who were companions of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as well as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Matthew, have the same authority as that of John. Besides, the Lord Himself might have told Matthew what those called before him had already been witnesses of. Your idea is, that John should have recorded this saying of the Lord, as he was present on the occasion. As if it might not happen that, since it was impossible to write all that be heard from the Lord, he set himself to write some, omitting this among others. Does he not say at the close of his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written"? <span class="stiki" id="note140637"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;21:25</a></span> This proves that he omitted many things intentionally. But if you choose John as an authority regarding the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, I ask you only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> his testimony to them. It is John who writes that Isaiah saw the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140638"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse41">John&nbsp;12:41</a></span> It is in his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> we find the text already treated of: "If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me; for he wrote of me." <span class="stiki" id="note140639"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse46">John&nbsp;5:46</a></span> Your evasions are met on every side. You ought to say plainly that you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what you please, and not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what you please, is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> yourselves, and not the gospel.</p>

<p>4. Faustus thinks himself wonderfully clever in proving that Matthew was not the writer of this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, because, when speaking of his own election, he says not, He saw me, and said to me, Follow me; but, He saw him, and said to him, Follow me. This must have been said either in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or from a design to mislead. Faustus can hardly be so <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> as not to have read or heard that narrators, when speaking of themselves, often use a construction as if speaking of another. It is more probable that Faustus wished to bewilder those more <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> than himself, in the hope of getting hold on not a few unacquainted with these things. It is needless to resort to other writings to quote examples of this construction from profane authors for the information of our friends, and for the refutation of Faustus. We find examples in passages quoted above from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by Faustus himself, without any denial, or rather with the assertion, that they were written by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, only not written of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. When <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, then, writes of himself, does he say, I said this, or I did that, and not rather, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did? Or does he say, The Lord called me, The Lord said to me, and not rather, The Lord called <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, The Lord said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and so on? So Matthew, too, speaks of himself in the third person. And John does the same; for towards the end of his book he says: "Peter, turning, saw the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> whom Jesus loved, who also lay on His breast at supper, and who said to the Lord, Who is it that shall betray You?" Does he say, Peter, turning, saw me? Or will you argue from this that John did not write this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>? But he adds a little after: "This is the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> that testifies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and has written these things; and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his testimony is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140640"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;21:20-24</a></span> Does he say, I am the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> who testify of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and who have written these things, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my testimony is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? Evidently this style is common in writers of narratives. There are innumerable instances in which the Lord Himself uses it. "When the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>," He says, "comes, shall He find <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the earth?" <span class="stiki" id="note140641"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;18:8</a></span> Not, When I come, shall I find? Again, "The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> came eating and drinking;" <span class="stiki" id="note140642"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;11:19</a></span> not, I came. Again, "The hour shall come, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and they that hear shall live;" <span class="stiki" id="note140643"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;5:25</a></span> not, My voice. And so in many other places. This may suffice to satisfy inquirers and to refute scoffers.</p>

<p>5. Every one can see the weakness of the argument that Christ could not have said, "Think not that I have come to destroy the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: I came not to destroy, but to fulfill," unless He had done something to create a suspicion of this kind. Of course, we grant that the unenlightened <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> may have looked upon Christ as the destroyer of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; but their very suspicion makes it certain that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and truthful One, in saying that He came not to destroy the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, referred to no other law than that of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the words that follow: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called the least in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. But whosoever shall do and teach them, shall be called great in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>." This applied to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who taught the law in word, while they broke it in deed. Christ says of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> in another place, "What they say, that do; but do not after their works: for they say, and do not." <span class="stiki" id="note140644"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;23:3</a></span> So here also He adds, "For I say unto you, Unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, you shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>;" <span class="stiki" id="note140645"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17-20</a></span> that is, Unless you shall both do and teach what they teach without doing, you shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. This law, therefore, which the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> taught without keeping it, Christ says He came not to destroy, but to fulfill; for this was the law connected with the seat of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> sat, who because they said without doing, are to be heard, but not to be imitated.</p>

<p>6. Faustus does not understand, or pretends not to understand, what it is to fulfill the law. He supposes the expression to mean the addition of words to the law, regarding which it is written that nothing is to be added to or taken away from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From this Faustus argues that there can be no fulfillment of what is spoken of as so perfect that nothing can be added to it or taken from it. Faustus requires to be told that the law is fulfilled by living as it enjoins. "Love is the fulfilling of the law," <span class="stiki" id="note140646"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> as the apostle says. The Lord has vouchsafed both to manifest and to impart this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, by sending the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to His believing people. So it is said by the same apostle: "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our heart by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is given unto us." <span class="stiki" id="note140647"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> And the Lord Himself says: "By this shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if you have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one to another." <span class="stiki" id="note140648"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;13:35</a></span> The law, then, is fulfilled both by the observance of its precepts and by the accomplishment of its prophecies. For "the law was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140649"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse7">John&nbsp;1:7</a></span> The law itself, by being fulfilled, becomes <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Grace is the fulfillment of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the accomplishment of the prophecies. And as both <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are by Christ, it follows that He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it; not by supplying any defects in the law, but by <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to what is written in the law. Christ's own words declare this. For He does not say, One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till its defects are supplied, but "till all be fulfilled."</p>
