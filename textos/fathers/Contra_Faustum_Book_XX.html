<h1>Contra Faustum, Book XX</h1>

<p><strong>Faustus repels the charge of sun-worship, and maintains that while the Manich&aelig;ans believe that God's power dwells in the sun and his wisdom in the moon, they yet worship one deity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are not a schism of the Gentiles, nor a sect. Augustine emphasizes the charge of polytheism, and goes into an elaborate comparison of Manich&aelig;an and pagan mythology.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: You ask why we worship the sun, if we are a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> or separate religion, and not Pagans, or merely a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. It may therefore be as well to inquire into the matter, that we may see whether the name of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> is more applicable to you or to us. Perhaps, in giving you in a friendly way this simple account of my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I shall appear to be making an apology for it, as if I were ashamed, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid, of doing homage to the divine luminaries. You may take it as you please; but I shall not regret what I have done if I succeed in conveying to some at least this much <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that our religion has nothing in common with that of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<p>2. We worship, then, one deity under the threefold appellation of the Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and his son Christ, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. While these are one and the same, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also that the Father properly dwells in the highest or principal light, which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> calls "light inaccessible," <span class="stiki" id="note140735"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:16</a></span> and the Son in his second or visible light. And as the Son is himself twofold, according to the apostle, who speaks of Christ as the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note140736"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that His power dwells in the sun, and His wisdom in the moon. We also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the third majesty, has His seat and His home in the whole circle of the atmosphere. By His influence and spiritual infusion, the earth conceives and brings forth the mortal Jesus, who, as hanging from every tree, is the life and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men.  Though you oppose these doctrines so violently, your religion resembles ours in attaching the same sacredness to the bread and wine that we do to everything. This is our belief, which you will have an opportunity of hearing more of, if you wish to do so. Meanwhile there is some force in the consideration that you or any one that is asked where his God dwells, will say that he dwells in light; so that the testimony in favor of my worship is almost universal.</p>

<p>3. As to your calling us a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and not a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, I suppose the word <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> applies to those who have the same doctrines and worship as other people, and only choose to meet separately. The word <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, again, applies to those whose doctrine is quite unlike that of others, and who have made a form of divine worship peculiar to themselves. If this is what the words mean, in the first place, in our doctrine and worship we have no resemblance to the Pagans. We shall see presently whether you have. The Pagan doctrine is, that all things good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, mean and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, fading and unfading, changeable and unchangeable, material and divine, have only one principle. In opposition to this, my belief is that God is the principle of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and <em>Hyle</em> [matters] of the opposite. <em>Hyle</em> is the name given by our master in divinity to the principle or nature of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The Pagans accordingly think it right to worship God with altars, and shrines, and images, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. Here also my practice differs entirely from theirs: for I look upon myself as a reasonable temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if I am worthy to be so; and I consider Christ his Son as the living image of his living majesty; and I hold a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> well cultivated to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> altar, and pure and simple <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way of paying divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> and of offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. Is this being a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the Pagans?</p>

<p>4. As regards the worship of the Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you might call us a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for all <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are bold enough to profess this worship, were it not for the difference in the form of our worship, though it may be questioned whether the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> really worship the Almighty. But the doctrine I have mentioned is common to the Pagans in their worship of the sun, and to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in their worship of the Almighty. Even in relation to you, we are not properly a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, though we acknowledge Christ and worship Him; for our worship and doctrine are different from yours. In a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, little or no change is made from the original; as, for instance, you, in your <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, have brought with you the doctrine of a single principle, for you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that all things are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> you change into <a href="../cathen/01200b.htm">love-feasts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> into <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, to whom you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> as they do to their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. You appease the shades of the departed with wine and food. You keep the same holidays as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; for example, the calends and the solstices. In your way of living you have made no change. Plainly you are a mere <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; for the only difference from the original is that you meet separately. In this you have followed the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who separated from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but differed only in not having images. For they used temples, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and altars, and a <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and the whole round of ceremonies the same as those of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, only more superstitious. Like the Pagans, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a single principle; so that both you and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are schisms of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, for you have the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and nearly the same worship, and you call yourselves <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> only because you meet separately. The fact is, there are only two <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and ourselves. We and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are as contrary in our belief as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, day and night, poverty and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, health and sickness. You, again, are not a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> in relation either to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. You are merely a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> not of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<p>5. <em>Augustine</em> replied: O hateful mixture of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and cunning! Why do you put arguments in the mouth of your opponent, which no one that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> you would use? We do not call you Pagans, or a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Pagans; but we say that you resemble them in worshipping many gods. But you are far worse than Pagans, for they worship things which exist, though they should not be worshipped: for <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> have an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, though for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> they are nought. So, to worship a tree with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, instead of improving it by cultivation, is not to worship nothing, but to worship in a wrong way. When the apostle says that "the things which the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note140738"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:20</a></span> he means that these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> exist to whom the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are made, and with whom he wishes us not to be partakers. So, too, heaven and earth, the sea and air, the sun and moon, and the other heavenly bodies, are all objects which have a sensible <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. When the Pagans worship these as gods, or as parts of one great God (for some of them identify the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> with the Supreme Deity), they worship things which have an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. In arguing with Pagans, we do not deny the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of these things, but we say that they should not be worshipped; and we recommend the worship of the invisible Creator of all these things, in whom alone man can find the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which all allow that he desires. To those, again, who worship what is invisible and immaterial, but still is created, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or mind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, we say that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not to be found in the creature even under this form, and that we must worship the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is not only invisible, but unchangeable; for He alone is to be worshipped, in the enjoyment of whom the worshipper finds <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and without whom the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must be wretched, whatever else it possesses. You, on the other hand, who worship things which have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> at all except in your fictitious legends, would be nearer <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and religion if you were Pagans, or if you were worshippers of what has an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, though not a proper object of worship. In fact, you do not properly worship the sun, though he carries your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> with him in his course round the heavens.</p>

<p>6. Your statements about the sun himself are so false and absurd, that if he were to repay you for the injury done to him, he would scorch you to death. First of all, you call the sun a ship, so that you are not only astray worlds off, as the saying is, but adrift. Next, while every one sees that the sun is round, which is the form corresponding from its perfection to his position among the heavenly bodies, you maintain that he is triangular, that is, that his light shines on the earth through a triangular window in heaven. Hence it is that you bend and bow your heads to the sun, while you worship not this visible sun, but some imaginary ship which you suppose to be shining through a triangular opening. Assuredly this ship would never have been heard of, if the words required for the composition of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> fictions had to be paid for, like the wood required for the beams of a ship. All this is comparatively harmless, however ridiculous or pitiable. Very different is your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> fancy about youths of both sexes proceeding from this ship, whose beauty excites eager desire in the princes and princesses of darkness; and so the members of your god are released from this humiliating confinement in the members of the race of darkness, by means of sinful passion and sensual appetite. And to these filthy rags of yours you would unite the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Trinity; for you say that the Father dwells in a secret light, the power of the Son in the sun, and His wisdom in the moon, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the air.</p>

<p>7. As for this threefold or rather fourfold fiction, what shall I say of the secret light of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but that you can think of no light except what you have seen? From your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of visible light, with which beasts and insects as well as men are familiar, you form some vague idea in your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and call it the light in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father dwells with His subjects. How can you distinguish between the light by which we see, and that by which we understand, when, according to your ideas, to understand <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is nothing else than to form the conception of material forms, either finite or in some cases <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; and you actually <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in these wild fancies? It is manifest that the act of my mind in thinking of your region of light which has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, is entirely different from my conception of Alexandria, which exists, though I have not seen it. And, again, the act of forming a conception of Alexandria, which I have never seen, is very different from thinking of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, which I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But this difference is insignificant as compared with that between my thinking of material things which I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from seeing them, and my understanding <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, goodness, and things of this nature. Can you describe this intellectual light, which gives us a clear perception of the distinction between itself and other things, as well as of the distinction between those things themselves? And yet even this is not the sense in which it can be said that God is light, for this light is created, whereas God is the Creator; the light is made, and He is the Maker; the light is changeable. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> changes from dislike to desire, from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, from forgetfulness to recollection; whereas God remains the same in will, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. From God we derive the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, the principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the law of affection. From God all animals, rational and irrational, derive the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of their life, the capacity of sensation, the faculty of emotion. From God all bodies derive their subsistence in extension, their beauty in number, and their order in weight. This light is one divine being, in an inseparable triune <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and yet, without supposing the assumption of any bodily form, you assign to separate places parts of the immaterial, spiritual, and unchangeable substance. And instead of three places for the Trinity, you have four: one, the light inaccessible, which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing about, for the Father; two, the sun and moon, for the Son; and again one, the circle of the atmosphere, for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Of the inaccessible light of the Father I shall say nothing further at present, for <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> do not separate the Son and the Spirit from the Father in relation to this light.</p>

<p>8. It is difficult to understand how you have been taken with the absurd idea of placing the power of the Son in the sun, and His wisdom in the moon. For, as the Son remains inseparably in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, His wisdom and power cannot be separated from one another, so that one should be in the sun and the other in the moon. Only material things can be thus assigned to separate places. If you only understood this, it would have prevented you from taking the productions of a diseased fancy as the material for so many fictions. But there is inconsistency and improbability as well as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> in your ideas. For, according to you, the seat of wisdom is inferior in brightness to the seat of power. Now energy and productiveness are the qualities of power, whereas light teaches and manifests; so that if the sun had the greater heat, and the moon the greater light, these absurdities might appear to have some likelihood to men of carnal minds, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing except through material conceptions. From the connection between great heat and motion, they might identify power with heat; while light from its brightness, and as making things discernible, they might represent wisdom. But what folly as well as profanity, in placing power in the sun, which excels so much in light, and wisdom in the moon, which is so inferior in brightness! And while you separate Christ from Himself, you do not distinguish between Christ and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; whereas Christ is one, the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Spirit is a distinct person. But according to you, the air, which you make the seat of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, fills and pervades the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. So the sun and moon in their course are always united to the air. But the moon approaches the sun at one time, and recedes from it at another. So that, if we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you, or rather, if we may allow ourselves to be imposed on by you, wisdom recedes from power by half the circumference of a circle, and again approaches it by the other half. And when wisdom is full, it is at a distance from power. For when the moon is full, the distance between the two bodies is so great, that the moon rises in the east while the sun is setting in the west. But as the loss of power produces weakness, the fuller the moon is, the weaker must wisdom be. If, as is certainly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the wisdom of God is unchangeable in power, and the power of God unchangeable in wisdom, how can you separate them so as to assign them to different places? And how can the place be different when the substance is the same? Is this not the infatuation of subjection to material fancies; showing such a want of power and wisdom that your wisdom is as weak as your power is foolish? This execrable absurdity would divide Christ between the sun and the moon&mdash;His power in one, and His wisdom in the other; so that He would be incomplete in both, lacking wisdom in the sun, and power in the moon, while in both He supplies youths, male and female, to excite the affection of the princes and princesses of darkness. Such are the tenets which you learn and profess. Such is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which directs your conduct. And can you wonder that you are regarded with abhorrence?</p>

<p>9. But besides your <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> regarding these conspicuous and familiar luminaries, which you worship not for what they are, but for what your wild fancy makes them to be, your other absurdities are still worse than this. Your illustrious World-bearer, and Atlas who helps to hold him up, are unreal beings. Like innumerable other creatures of your fancy, they have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and yet you worship them. For this reason we say that you are worse than Pagans, while you resemble them in worshipping many gods. You are worse, because, while they worship things which exist though they are not gods, you worship things which are neither gods nor anything else, for they have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. The Pagans, too, have fables, but they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them to be fables; and either look upon them as amusing poetical fancies, or try to explain them as representing the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things, or the life of man. Thus they say that Vulcan is lame, because flame in common fire has an irregular motion: that Fortune is blind, because of the uncertainty of what are called fortuitous occurrences: that there are three Fates, with distaff, and spindle, and fingers spinning wool into thread, because there are three times&mdash;the past, already spun and wound on the spindle; the present, which is passing through the fingers of the spinner; and the future, still in wool bound to the distaff, and soon to pass through the fingers to the spindle, that is, through the present into the future: and that Venus is the wife of Vulcan, because pleasure has a natural connection with heat; and that she is the mistress of Mars, because pleasure is not properly the companion of warriors: and that Cupid is a boy with wings and a bow, from the wounds inflicted by thoughtless, inconstant passion in the hearts of unhappy beings: and so with many other fables. The great absurdity is in their continuing to worship these beings, after giving such explanations; for the worship without the explanations, though criminal, would be a less heinous crime. The very explanations prove that they do not worship that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the enjoyment of whom can alone give <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but things which He has created. And even in the creature they worship not only the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as in Minerva, who sprang from the head of Jupiter, and who represents <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>&mdash;a quality of reason which, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, has its seat in the head&mdash;but their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, too, as in Cupid. Thus one of their dramatic poets says, "Sinful passion, in favor of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, made Love a god."  Even bodily <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> had temples in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as in the case of pallor and fever. Not to dwell on the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the worshippers of these <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, who are in a way affected by the bodily forms, so that they pay homage to them as deities, when they see them set up in some lofty place, and treated with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and reverence, there is greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the very explanations which are intended as apologies for these dumb, and deaf, and blind, and lifeless objects. Still, though, as I have said, these things are nothing in the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or of usefulness, both they and the things they are said to represent are real existences. But your First Man, warring with the five elements; and your Mighty Spirit, who constructs the world from the captive bodies of the race of darkness, or rather from the members of your god in subjection and bondage; and your World-holder, who has in his hand the remains of these members, and who bewails the capture and bondage and pollution of the rest; and your giant Atlas, who keeps up the World-holder on his shoulders, lest he should from weariness throw away his burden, and so prevent the completion of the final imitation of the mass of darkness, which is to be the last scene in your drama;&mdash; these and countless other absurdities are not represented in painting or sculpture, or in any explanation; and yet you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and worship things which have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, while you taunt the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with being credulous for believing in realities with a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which pacifies the mind under its influence. The objects of your worship can be shown to have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, which I do not bring forward here, because, though I could without difficulty discourse philosophically on the construction of the world, it would take too long to do so here. One <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> suffices. If these things are real, God must be subject to change, and corruption, and contamination; a supposition as <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> as it is irrational. All these things, therefore, are vain, and false, and unreal. Thus you are much worse than those Pagans, with whom all are familiar, and who still preserve traces of their old customs, of which they themselves are ashamed; for while they worship things which are not gods, you worship things which do not exist.</p>

<p>10. If you think that your doctrines are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> because they are unlike the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the Pagans, and that we are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> because we perhaps differ more from you than from them, you might as well say that a dead man is in good health because he is not sick; or that good health is undesirable, because it differs less from sickness than from death. Or if the Pagans should be viewed in many cases as rather dead than sick, you might as well praise the ashes in the tomb because they have no longer the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> shape, as compared with the living body, which does not differ so much from a corpse as from ashes. It is thus we are reproached for having more resemblance to the dead body of Paganism than to the ashes of Manich&aelig;ism. But in division, it often happens that a thing is placed in different classes, according to the point of resemblance on which the division proceeds. For instance, if animals are divided into those that fly and those that cannot fly, in this division men and beasts are classed together as distinct from birds, because they are both unable to fly. But if they are divided into rational and irrational, beasts and birds are classed together as distinct from men, for they are both destitute of reason. Faustus did not think of this when he said: There are in fact only two <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and ourselves, for we are directly opposed to them in our belief. The opposition he means is this, that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a single principle, whereas the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in the principle of the race of darkness. Certainly, according to this division we agree in general with the Pagans. But if we divide all who have a religion into those who worship one God and those who worship many gods, the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> must be classed along with the Pagans, and we along with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. This is another distinction, which may be said to make only two <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. Perhaps you will say that you hold all your gods to be of one substance, which the Pagans do not. But you at least resemble them in assigning to your gods different powers, and functions, and employments. One does battle with the race of darkness; another constructs the world from the part which is captured; another, standing above, has the world in his hand; another holds him up from below; another turns the wheels of the fires and winds and waters beneath; another, in his circuit of the heavens, gathers with his beams the members of your god from cesspools. Indeed, your gods have innumerable occupations, according to your fabulous descriptions, which you neither explain nor represent in a visible form. But again, if men were divided into those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God takes an interest in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs and those who do not, the Pagans and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and you and all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> that have anything of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, will be classed together, as opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, and any others holding similar views. As this is a principle of importance, here again we may say that there are only two <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, and you belong to the same <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> as we do. You will hardly venture to dissent from us in the opinion that God is concerned in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, so that in this matter your opposition to the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> makes you side with us. Thus, according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the division, what is in one class at one time, is in another at another time: things joined here are separated there: in some things we are classed with others, and they with us; in other things we are classed separately, and stand alone. If Faustus thought of this, he would not talk such eloquent nonsense.</p>

<p>11. But what are we to make of these words of Faustus: The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by his influence and spiritual infusion, makes the earth conceive and bring forth the mortal Jesus, who, as hanging from every tree, is the life and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men? Letting pass for a moment the absurdity of this statement, we observe the folly of believing that the mortal Jesus can be conceived through the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by the earth, but not by the Virgin Mary. Dare you compare the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of that chaste virgin's womb with any piece of ground where trees and plants grow? Do you pretend to look with abhorrence upon a pure virgin, while you do not shrink from believing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is produced in gardens watered by the filthy drains of a city? For plants of all kinds spring up and are nourished in such moisture. You will have Jesus to be born in this way, while you cry out against the idea of His being born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Do you think flesh more unclean than the excrements which its nature rejects? Is the filth cleaner than the flesh which expels it? Are you not aware how fields are manured in order to make them productive? Your folly comes to this, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who, according to you, despised the womb of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, makes the earth conceive more fruitfully in proportion as it is carefully enriched with animal off-scourings. Do you reply that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> preserves His incorruptible purity everywhere? I ask again, Why not also in the virgin's womb? Passing from the conception, you maintain in regard to the mortal Jesus&mdash; who, as you say, is born from the earth, which has conceived by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>&mdash; that He hangs in the shape of fruit from every tree: so that, besides this pollution, He suffers additional defilement from the flesh of the countless animals that eat the fruit; except, indeed, the small amount that is purified by your eating it. While we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and confess Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, to have become flesh without suffering defilement, because the divine substance is not defiled by flesh, as it is not defiled by anything, your fanciful notions would make Jesus to be defiled even as hanging on the tree, before entering the flesh of any animal; for if He were not defiled, there would be no need of His being purified by your eating Him. And if all trees are the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as Faustus seems to imply when he says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> hangs from every tree, why do you not pluck the fruit, and so take Jesus down from hanging on the tree to bury Him in your stomach, which would correspond to the good deed of Joseph of Arimathea, when he took down the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Jesus from the cross to bury Him? <span class="stiki" id="note140740"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;19:38</a></span> Why should it be impious to take Christ from the tree, while it is <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> to lay Him in the tomb? Perhaps you wish to apply to yourselves the words quoted from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, "Their throat is an open sepulchre:" <span class="stiki" id="note140741"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;3:13</a></span> and so you wait with open mouth till some one comes to use your throat as the best sepulchre for Christ. Once more, how many Christs do you make? Is there one whom you call the mortal Christ, whom the earth conceives and brings forth by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and another crucified by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>; and a third whom you divide between the sun and the moon? Or is it one and the same person, part of whom is confined in the trees, to be released by the help of the other part which is not confined? If this is the case, and you allow that Christ suffered under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, though it is difficult to see how he could have suffered without flesh, as you say he did, the great question is, with whom he left those ships you speak of, that he might come down and suffer these things, which he certainly could not have suffered without having a body of some kind. A mere spiritual presence could not have made him liable to these sufferings, and in his bodily presence he could not be at the same time in the sun, in the moon, and on the cross. So, then, if he had not a body, he was not crucified; and if he had a body, the question is, where he got it: for, according to you, all bodies belong to the race of darkness, though you cannot think of the divine substance except as being material. Thus you must say either that Christ was crucified without a body; which is utterly absurd; or that he was crucified in appearance and not in reality, which is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; or that all bodies do not belong to the race of darkness, but that the divine substance has also a body, and that not an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> body, but liable to crucifixion and death, which, again, is altogether erroneous; or that Christ had a mortal body from the race of darkness, so that, while you will not allow that Christ's body came from the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, you derive it from the race of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Finally, as in Faustus' statement, in which he alludes in the briefest manner possible to the lengthy stories of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> invention, the earth by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> conceives and brings forth the mortal Jesus, who, hanging from every tree, is the life and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, why should this Saviour be represented by whatever is hanging, because he hung on the tree, and not by whatever is born, because he was born? But if you mean that the Jesus on the trees, and the Jesus crucified under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, and the Jesus divided between the sun and the moon, are all one and the same substance, why do you not give the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to your whole host of deities? Why should not your World-holder be Jesus too, and Atlas, and the King of Honour, and the Mighty Spirit, and the First Man, and all the rest, with their various names and occupations?</p>

<p>12. So, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, how can you say that he is the third person, when the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> you mention are innumerable? Or why is he not Jesus himself? And why does Faustus mislead people, in trying to make out an agreement between himself and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, from whom he differs only too widely, by saying, We worship one God under the threefold appellation of the Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Christ his Son, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? Why is the appellation only threefold, instead of being manifold? And why is the distinction in appellation only, and not in reality, if there are as many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as there are names? For it is not as if you gave three names to the same thing, as the same weapon may be called a short sword, a dagger, or a dirk; or as you give the name of moon, and the lesser ship, and the luminary of night, and so on, to the same thing. For you cannot say that the First Man is the same as the Mighty Spirit, or as the World-Holder, or as the giant Atlas. They are all distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and you do not call any of them Christ. How can there be one Deity with opposite functions? Or why should not Christ himself be the single person, if in one substance Christ hangs on the trees, and was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and exists in the sun and moon? The fact is, your fancies are all astray, and are no better than the dreams of insanity.</p>

<p>13. How can Faustus think that we resemble the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> in attaching sacredness to bread and wine, when they consider it sacrilege to taste wine? They acknowledge their god in the grape, but not in the cup; perhaps they are shocked at his being trampled on and bottled. It is not any bread and wine that we hold sacred as a natural production, as if Christ were confined in grain or in vines, as the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> fancy, but what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>. What is not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, though it is bread and wine, is only nourishment or refreshment, with no sacredness about it; although we bless and thank God for every gift, bodily as well as spiritual. According to your notion, Christ is confined in everything you eat, and is released by digestion from the additional confinement of your intestines. So, when you eat, your god suffers; and when you digest, you suffer from his recovery. When he fills you, your gain is his loss. This might be considered kindness on his part, because he suffers in you for your benefit, were it not that he gains freedom by escaping and leaving you empty. There is not the least resemblance between our reverence for the bread and wine, and your doctrines, which have no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in them. To compare the two is even more foolish than to say, as some do, that in the bread and wine we worship Ceres and Bacchus. I refer to this now, to show where you got your silly idea that our fathers kept the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of Saturn. For as there is no connection with the worship of the Pagan deities Ceres and Bacchus in our observance of the sacrament of the bread and wine, which you approve so highly that you wish to resemble us in it, so there was no subjection to Saturn in the case of our fathers, who observed the rest of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> in a manner suitable to prophetic times.</p>

<p>14. You might have found a resemblance in your religion to that of the Pagans as regards <em>Hyle</em> [matter], which the Pagans often speak of. You, on the contrary, maintain that you are directly opposed to them in your belief in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principle which your teacher in theology calls <em> Hyle</em>. But here you only show your <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and, with an affectation of learning, use this word without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what it means. The Greeks, when speaking of nature, give the name <em> Hyle</em> to the subject-matter of things, which has no form of its own, but admits of all bodily forms, and is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only through these changeable phenomena, not being itself an object of sensation or perception. Some <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, indeed, erroneously make this matter co-eternal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as not being derived from Him, though the bodily forms are. In this manifest <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> you resemble the Pagans, for you hold that <em>Hyle</em> has a principle of its own, and does not come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is only <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that leads you to deny this resemblance. In saying that <em>Hyle</em> has no form of its own, and can take its forms only from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Pagans come near to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in contradistinction from your <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what <em>Hyle</em> or the subject-matter of things is, you make it the race of darkness, in which you place not only innumerable bodily forms of five different kinds, but also a formative mind. Such, indeed, is your <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or insanity, that you call this mind <em>Hyle</em>, and make it give forms instead of taking them. If there were such a formative mind as you speak of, and bodily elements capable of form, the word <em>Hyle</em> would properly be applicable to the bodily elements, which would be the matter to be formed by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which you make the principle of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Even this would not be a quite accurate use of the word <em> Hyle</em>, which has no form of any kind; whereas these elements, although capable of new forms, have already the form of elements, and belong to different kinds. Still this use of the word would not be so much amiss, notwithstanding your <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; for it would thus be applied, as it properly is, to that which takes form, and not to that which gives it. Even here, however, your folly and impiety would appear in tracing so much that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principle, from your not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that all natures of every kind, all forms in their proportion, and all weights in their order, can come only from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. As it is, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> neither what <em>Hyle</em> is, nor what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is. Would that I could persuade you to refrain from misleading people still more <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> than yourselves!</p>

<p>15. Every one must see the folly of your boasting of superiority to the Pagans because they use altars and temples, images and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, in the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which you do not. As if it were not better to build an altar and offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to a stone, which has some kind of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, than to employ a heated imagination in worshipping things which have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> at all. And what do you mean by saying that you are a rational temple of God? Can that be God's temple which is partly the construction of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? And is this not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of you, as you say that all your members and your whole body were formed by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principle which you call <em>Hyle</em>, and that part of this formative mind dwells in the body along with part of your god? And as this part of your god is bound and confined, you should be called the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of God rather than his temple. Perhaps it is your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as you have it from the region of light. But you generally call your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> not a temple, but a part or member of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So, when you say you are the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it must be in your body, which, you say, was formed by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Thus you <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, calling it not only the workmanship of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, but the prison-house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The apostle, on the other hand, says: "The temple of God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, which temple you are." And to show that this refers not merely to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he says expressly: "Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your bodies are the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is in you, which you have of God?"  You call the workmanship of devils the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there, to use Faustus' words, you place Christ, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the living image of living majesty. Your impiety may well contrive a fabulous temple for a fabulous Christ. The image you speak of must be so called, because it is the creature of your imagination.</p>

<p>16. If your mind is an altar, you see whose altar it is. You may see from the very doctrines and duties in which you say you are trained. You are taught not to give food to a beggar; and so your altar smokes with the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of cruelty. Such altars the Lord destroys; for in words quoted from the law He tells us what offering pleases God: "I desire mercy, and not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>." Observe on what occasion the Lord uses these words. It was when, in passing through a field, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> plucked the ears of grain because they were hungry. Your doctrine would lead you to call this <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Your mind is an altar, not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but of lying devils, by whose doctrines the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is seared as with a hot iron, <span class="stiki" id="note140743"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:2</a></span> calling <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> what the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> calls innocence. For in His words to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Christ by anticipation deals a fatal blow to you: "If you had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what this means, I desire mercy, and not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, you would not have condemned the guiltless." <span class="stiki" id="note140744"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;12:7</a></span> </p>

<p>17. Nor can you say that you <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> God with <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in the shape of pure and simple <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>: for, in your low, dishonoring notions about the divine nature and substance, you make your god to be the victim in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of Pagans; so far are you from pleasing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God with your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. For you hold that God is confined not only in trees and plants, or in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, but also in the flesh of animals, which contaminates Him with its impurity. And how can your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> give praise to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when you actually reproach Him by calling your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a particle of His substance taken captive by the race of darkness; as if God could not maintain the conflict except by this corruption of His members, and this dishonorable captivity? Instead of honoring God in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, you insult Him. For what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> did you commit, when you belonged to Him, that you should be thus punished by the god you cry to, not because you left Him sinfully of your own choice; for he himself gave you to His enemies, to obtain peace for His kingdom? You are not even given as hostages to be honorably guarded. Nor is it as when a shepherd lays a snare to catch a wild beast: for he does not put one of his own members in the snare, but some animal from his flock; and generally, so that the wild beast is caught before the animal is hurt. You, though you are the members of your god, are given to the enemy, whose ferocity you keep off from your god only by being contaminated with their impurity, infected with their corruptions, without any fault of your own. You cannot in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> use the words: "Free us, O Lord, for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Your name; and for Your name's sake pardon our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."  Your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is: "Free us by Your skill, for we suffer here oppression, and torture, and pollution, only that You may mourn unmolested in Your kingdom." These are words of reproach, not of entreaty. Nor can you use the words taught us by the Master of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors." <span class="stiki" id="note140746"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> For who are the debtors who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against you? If it is the race of darkness, you do not forgive their debts, but make them be utterly cast out and shut up in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> imprisonment. And how can God forgive your debts, when He rather <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against you by sending you into such a state, than you against Him, whom you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> by going? If this was not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in Him, because He was compelled to do it, this excuse must apply you, now that you have been overthrown in the conflict, more than to Him before the conflict began. You suffer now from the mixture of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which was not the case with Him when nevertheless He was compelled to send you. So either He requires that you should forgive Him his debt; or, if He is not in debt to you, still less are you to Him. It appears that your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and your pure and simple <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are false and vile <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>.</p>

<p>18. How is it, by the way, that you use the words temple, altar, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, for the purpose of commending your own practices? If such things can be spoken of as properly belonging to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, they must constitute the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worship of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. And if there is such a thing as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is implied in the expression divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, there must be some one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of which the rest are imitations. On the one hand, we have the spurious imitations in the case of false and lying gods, that is, of devils, who proudly demand divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> from their deluded votaries, as is or was the case in the temples and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. On the other hand, we have the prophetic intimations of one most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to be offered for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> enjoined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on our fathers; along with which there was also the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> anointing typical of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the name Christ itself means anointed. The animal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, therefore, presumptuously claimed by devils, were an imitation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which is due only to the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which Christ alone offered on His altar. Thus the apostle says: "The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> offer, they offer to devils, and not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140747"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse30">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:30</a></span> He does not find fault with <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, but with offering to devils. The Hebrews, again, in their animal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, which they offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in many varied forms, suitably to the significance of the institution, typified the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> offered by Christ. This <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is also commemorated by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, in the sacred offering and participation of the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> understand neither the sinfulness of the Gentile <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, nor the importance of the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, nor the use of the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. Their own <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> are the offering they present to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who has deceived them. And thus they depart from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, giving heed to seducing spirits, and to doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy.</p>

<p>19. It may be well that Faustus, or at least that those who are charmed with Faustus' writings, should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the doctrine of a single principle did not come to us from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; for the belief in one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from whom every kind of nature is derived, is a part of the original <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> retained among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, notwithstanding their having fallen away to many false gods. For the Gentile <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> had the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because, as the apostle says, "the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse." But, as the apostle adds, "when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things." <span class="stiki" id="note140748"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;1:20-23</a></span> These are the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which they cannot explain except by referring to the creatures made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that this very explanation of their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, on which the more enlightened <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were wont to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their superiority, shows the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the following words of the apostle: "They worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever." <span class="stiki" id="note140749"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;1:25</a></span> Where you differ from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, you are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; where you resemble them, you are worse than they. You do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, as they do, in a single principle; and so you fall into the impiety of believing the substance of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God to be liable to subjugation and corruption. As regards the worship of a plurality of gods, the doctrine of lying devils has led the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to worship many <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and you to worship many phantasms.</p>

<p class="p20">20. We do not turn the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> into <a href="../cathen/01200b.htm">love-feasts</a>, as Faustus says we do. Our <a href="../cathen/01200b.htm">love-feasts</a> are rather a substitute for the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> spoken of by the Lord, in the words already quoted: "I will have mercy, and not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>." At our <a href="../cathen/01200b.htm">love-feasts</a> the poor obtain vegetable or animal food; and so the creature of God is used, as far as it is suitable, for the nourishment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is also God's creature. You have been led by lying devils, not in self-denial, but in <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, "to abstain from meats which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For every creature of God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving." <span class="stiki" id="note140750"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:3-4</a></span> In return for the bounties of the Creator, you ungratefully insult Him with your impiety; and because in our <a href="../cathen/01200b.htm">love-feasts</a> flesh is often given to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, you compare <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity to Pagan <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. This indeed, is another point in which you resemble some Pagans. You consider it a crime to kill animals, because you think that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men pass into them; which is an idea found in the writings of some Gentile <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, although their successors appear to have thought differently. But here again you are most in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: for they dreaded slaughtering a relative in the animal; but you dread the slaughter of your god, for you hold even the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of animals to be his members.</p>

<p class="p21">21. As to our paying <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to the memory of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and the accusation of Faustus, that we worship them instead of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, I should not care to answer such a charge, were it not for the sake of showing how Faustus, in his desire to cast reproach on us, has overstepped the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> inventions, and has fallen heedlessly into a popular notion found in Pagan poetry, although he is so anxious to be distinguished from the Pagans. For in saying that we have turned the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> into <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, he speaks of our worshipping them with similar <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, and appeasing the shades of the departed with wine and food. Do you, then, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in shades? We never heard you speak of such things, nor have we read of them in your books. In fact, you generally oppose such ideas: for you tell us that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead, if they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, or not purified, are made to pass through various changes, or suffer punishment still more severe; while the good <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are placed in ships, and sail through heaven to that imaginary region of light which they died fighting for. According to you, then, no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> remain near the burying-place of the body; and how can there be any shades of the departed? What and where are they? Faustus' <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of evil-speaking has made him forget his own creed; or perhaps he spoke in his sleep about ghosts, and did not wake up even when he saw his words in writing. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> pay religious <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to the memory of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, both to excite us to imitate them and to obtain a share in their merits, and the assistance of their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. But we build altars not to any <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, although it is to the memory of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. No one officiating at the altar in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> burying-place ever says, We bring an offering to you, O Peter! Or O <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>! Or O Cyprian! The offering is made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gave the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, while it is in memory of those thus crowned. The emotion is increased by the associations of the place, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is excited both towards those who are our examples, and towards Him by whose help we may follow such examples. We regard the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> with the same affectionate intimacy that we feel towards <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this life, when we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that their hearts are prepared to endure the same suffering for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the gospel. There is more devotion in our feeling towards the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that their conflict is over; and we can speak with greater confidence in praise of those already victors in heaven, than of those still combating here. What is properly divine worship, which the Greeks call <span class="greek"> <em><a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a></em></span>, and for which there is no word in Latin, both in doctrine and in practice, we give only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To this worship belongs the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; as we see in the word <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, which means the giving of this worship to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. Accordingly we never offer, or require any one to offer, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, or to a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or to any <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Any one falling into this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is instructed by doctrine, either in the way of correction or of caution. For <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> beings themselves, whether <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, refuse to accept what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be due to God alone. We see this in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, when the men of Lycaonia wished to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to them as gods, on account of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> they performed. They rent their clothes, and restrained the people, crying out to them, and persuading them that they were not gods. We see it also in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as we read in the Apocalypse that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> would not allow himself to be worshipped, and said to his worshipper, "I am your fellow-servant, and of your brethen." <span class="stiki" id="note140751"><a href="../bible/rev019.htm#verse10">Revelation&nbsp;19:10</a></span> Those who claim this worship are <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> spirits, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as we see in all the temples and <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Some <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> men, too, have copied their example; as is related of some kings of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Daniel was accused and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, because when the king made a decree that no petition should be made to any god, but only to the king, he was found worshipping and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to his own <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. <span class="stiki" id="note140752"><a href="../bible/dan006.htm">Daniel&nbsp;vi</a></span> As for those who drink to excess at the feasts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, we of course condemn their conduct; for to do so even in their own houses would be contrary to sound doctrine. But we must try to amend what is bad as well as prescribe what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and must of necessity bear for a time with some things that are not according to our teaching. The rules of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> conduct are not to be taken from the indulgences of the intemperate or the infirmities of the weak. Still, even in this, the guilt of intemperance is much less than that of impiety. To <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, even <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, is worse than to go home intoxicated from their feast: to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, I say, which is a different thing from <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in memory of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, as we do constantly, in the manner required since the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, for this belongs to the worship or <span class="greek"> <em><a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a></em></span> which is due to God alone. But it is vain to try to make these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> understand the full meaning of these words of the Psalmist: "He that offers the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorifies</a> me, and in this way will I show him my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>."  Before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the flesh and blood of this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> were foreshadowed in the animals slain; in the passion of Christ the types were fulfilled by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is commemorated in the sacrament. Between the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the Pagans and of the Hebrews there is all the difference that there is between a false imitation and a typical anticipation. We do not despise or denounce the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> because there were vestal <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. And, in the same way, it is no reproach to the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of our fathers that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also had <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. The difference between the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and vestal <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is great, yet it consists wholly in the being to whom the vow is made and paid; and so the difference in the being to whom the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the Pagans and Hebrews are made and offered makes a wide difference between them. In the one case they are offered to devils, who presumptuously make this claim in order to be held as gods, because <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is a divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. In the other case they are offered to the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as a type of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, which also was to be offered to Him in the passion of the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>22. Faustus is wrong in saying that our Jewish forefathers, in their separation from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, retained the temple, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and altars, and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and abandoned only graven images or <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, for they might have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, as some do, without any graven image, to trees and mountains, or even to the sun and moon and the stars. If they had thus rendered to these objects the worship called <em>latria</em>, they would have served the creature instead of the Creator, and so would have fallen into the serious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of heathenish <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>; and even without <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, they would have found devils ready to take advantage of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and to accept their offerings. For these <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits feed not, as some foolishly suppose, on the smell of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and the smoke, but on the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of men. They enjoy not bodily refreshment, but a malevolent gratification, when they in any way deceive people, or when, with a bold assumption of borrowed majesty, they boast of receiving divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>. It was not, therefore, only the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> that our Jewish forefathers abandoned. They <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> neither to the earth nor to any earthly thing, nor to the sea, nor to heaven, nor to the hosts of heaven, but laid the victims on the altar of the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Creator of all, who required these offerings as a means of foreshadowing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> victim, by whom He has reconciled us to Himself in the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. So <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, addressing <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, who are made the body of which Christ is the Head, says: "I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you present your bodies a living <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140754"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;12:1</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, on the other hand, say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies are the workmanship of the race of darkness, and the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in which the captive deity is confined. Thus Faustus' doctrine is very different from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a>. But since whosover preaches to you another gospel than that you have received must be accursed, what Christ says in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, while Manich&aelig;us in Faustus is accursed.</p>

<p>23. Faustus says also, without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what he says, that we have retained the manners of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. But seeing that the just lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that the end of the commandment is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> out of a pure heart, and a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned, and that these three, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, abide to form the life of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, it is impossible that there should be similarity in the manners of those who differ in these three things. Those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> differently, and hope differently, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> differently, must also live differently. And if we resemble the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in our use of such things as food and drink, and houses and clothes and baths, and those of us who marry, in taking and keeping wives, and in begetting and bringing up children as our heirs, there is still a great difference between the man who uses these things for some end of his own, and the man who, in using them, gives thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having no unworthy or erroneous ideas about God. For as you, according to your own <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, though you eat the same bread as other men, and live upon the produce of the same plants and the water of the same fountain, and are clothed like others in wool and linen, yet lead a different life, not because you eat or drink, or dress differently, but because you differ from others in your ideas and in your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and in all these things have in view an end of your own&mdash; the end, namely, set forth in your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a>; in the same way we, though we resemble the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in the use of this and other things, do not resemble them in our life; for while the things are the same, the end is different: for the end we have in view is, according to the just commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> out of a pure heart, and a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned; from which some having erred, are turned to vain jangling. In this vain jangling you bear the palm, for you do not attend to the fact that so great is the difference of life produced by a different <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even when the things in possession and use are the same, that though your followers have wives, and in spite of themselves get children, for whom they gather and store up <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>; though they eat flesh, drink wine, bathe, reap harvests, gather vintages, engage in trade, and occupy high official positions, you nevertheless reckon them as belonging to you, and not to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, though in their actions they approach nearer to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> than to you. And though some of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in some things resemble you more than your own followers&mdash;those, for instance, who in superstitious devotion abstain from flesh, and wine, and marriage,&mdash; you still count your own followers, even though they use all these things, and so are unlike you, as belonging to the flock of Manich&aelig;us rather than those who resemble you in their practices. You consider as belonging to you a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that believes in Manich&aelig;us, though she is a mother, rather than a Sibyl, though she never marries. But you will say that many who are called <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are adulterers, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, misers, drunkards, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine. I ask if none such are to be found in your company, which is almost too small to be called a company. And because there are some among the Pagans who are not of this character, do you consider them as better than yourselves? And yet, in fact, your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is so <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>, that even your followers who are not of such a character are worse than the Pagans who are. It is therefore no impeachment to sound doctrine, which alone is <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, that many wish to take its name, who will not yield to its beneficial influence. We must bear in mind the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of the contrast which the Lord makes between the little company and the mass of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, as spread over all the world; for the company of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> is small, as the amount of grain is small when compared with the heap of chaff; and yet the good grain is quite sufficient far to outnumber you, good and bad together, for good and bad are both strangers to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In a word, we are not a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, for we differ from them greatly for the better; nor are you, for you differ from them greatly for the worse. </p>
