<h1>Contra Faustum, Book XXII</h1>

<p><strong>Faustus states his objections to the morality of the law and the prophets, and Augustine seeks by the application of the type and the allegory to explain away the moral difficulties of the Old Testament.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: You ask why we <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. We are so far from professing or feeling any hostility to the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that we are ready, if you will allow us, to declare the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of all the writings which make the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> appear objectionable. But this you refuse to admit, and by maintaining the authority of your writers, you bring a perhaps unmerited reproach upon the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; you <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> the patriarchs, and dishonor the law. You are so unreasonable as to deny that your writers are false, while you uphold the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of those who are described in these writings as guilty of the worst crimes, and as leading <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> lives. These opinions are inconsistent; for either these were bad characters, or the writers were untruthful.</p>

<p>2. Supposing, then, that we agree in condemning the writers, we may succeed in vindicating the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. By the law must be understood not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, or <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, or <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, or the other Jewish observances, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> law, viz., You shall not kill, You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, You shall not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and so on. To this law, promulgated throughout the world, that is, at the commencement of the present constitution of the world, the Hebrew writers did <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, by infecting it with the pollution of their disgusting precepts about <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. As a friend of the law, you should join with me in condemning the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for injuring the law by this mixture of unsuitable precepts. Plainly, you must be aware that these precepts are not the law, or any part of the law, since you claim to be righteous, though you make no attempt to keep the precepts. In seeking to lead a righteous life, you pay great regard to the commandments which forbid sinful actions, while you take no notice of the Jewish observances; which would be unjustifiable if they were one and the same law. You resent as a foul reproach being called negligent of the precept, "You shall not kill," or "You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>." And if you showed the same resentment at being called uncircumcised, or negligent of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, it would be evident that you considered both to be the law and the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In fact, however, you consider the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of keeping the one no way endangered by disregard of the other. It is plain, as I have said, that these observances are not the law, but a disfigurement of the law. If we condemn them, it is not as being genuine, but as spurious. In this condemnation there is no reproach of the law, or of God its author, but only of those who published their shocking <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> under these names. If we sometimes abuse the venerable name of law in attacking the Jewish precepts, the fault is yours, for refusing to distinguish between Hebrew observances and the law. Only restore to the law its proper dignity, by removing these foul Israelitish blots; grant that these writers are guilty of disfiguring the law, and you will see at once that we are the enemies not of the law, but of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>. You are misled by the word law; for you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to what that name properly belongs.</p>

<p>3. For my part, I see no reason for your thinking that we <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and patriarchs. There would indeed be some ground for the charge, if we had been directly or remotely the authors of the account given of their actions. But as this account is written either by themselves, in a criminal desire to be famous for their misdeeds, or by their companions and coevals, why should you blame us? You condemn them in abhorrence of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> actions of which they have voluntarily declared themselves guilty, though there was no occasion for such a confession. Or if the narrative is only a malicious fiction, let its authors be punished, let the books be condemned, let the prophetic name be cleared from this foul reproach, let the patriarchs recover the respect due to their simplicity and purity of managers.</p>

<p>4. These books, moreover, contain shocking <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against God himself. We are told that he <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in darkness, and admired the light when he saw it; that he was so <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the future, that he gave <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> a command, not foreseeing that it would be broken; that his perception was so limited that he could not see <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> when, from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his nakedness, he hid himself in a corner of Paradise; that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> made him afraid lest his creature man should taste of the tree of life, and live for ever; that afterwards he was greedy for blood, and fat from all kinds of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and jealous if they were offered to any one but himself; that he was enraged sometimes against his enemies, sometimes against his friends; that he destroyed thousands of men for a slight offense, or for nothing; that he threatened to come with a sword and spare nobody, righteous or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. The authors of such bold libels against God might very well <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> the men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You must join with us in laying the blame on the writers if you wish to vindicate the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</p>

<p>5. Again, we are not responsible for what is said of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that in his irrational craving to have children, and not believing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who promised that his wife Sara should have a son, he defiled himself with a mistress, with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his wife, which only made it worse; <span class="stiki" id="note140781"><a href="../bible/gen016.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;16:2-4</a></span> or that, in <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> profanation of his marriage, he on different occasions, from <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and greed, sold his wife Sara for the gratification of the kings Abimelech and Pharas, telling them that she was his sister, because she was very fair.  The narrative is not ours, which tells how <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> brother, after his escape from <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, lay with his two daughters on the mountain <span class="stiki" id="note140783"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse33">Genesis&nbsp;19:33,&nbsp;35</a></span> (better for him to have perished in the conflagration of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, than to have burned with incestuous passion); or how Isaac imitated his father's conduct, and called his wife Rebecca his sister, that he might gain a shameful livelihood by her; <span class="stiki" id="note140784"><a href="../bible/gen026.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;26:7</a></span> or how his son Jacob, husband of four wives&mdash; two full sisters, Rachel and Leah, and their handmaids&mdash; led the life of a goat among them, so that there was a daily strife among his <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who should be the first to lay hold of him when he came from the field, ending sometimes in their hiring him from one another for the night;  or, again, how his son Judah slept with his daughter-in-law Tamar, after she had been married to two of his sons, deceived, we are told, by the harlot's dress which Tamar put on, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that her father-in-law was in the habit of associating with such characters; <span class="stiki" id="note140786"><a href="../bible/gen038.htm">Genesis&nbsp;xxxviii</a></span> or how David, after having a number of wives, seduced the wife of his soldier Uriah, and caused Uriah himself to be killed in the battle; <span class="stiki" id="note140787"><a href="../bible/2sa011.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;11:4,&nbsp;15</a></span> or how his son Solomon had three hundred wives, and seven hundred concubines, and princesses without number; <span class="stiki" id="note140788"><a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;11:1-3</a></span> or how the first <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Hosea got children from a prostitute, and, what is worse, it is said that this disgraceful conduct was enjoined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note140789"><a href="../bible/hos001.htm#verse2">Hosea&nbsp;1:2-3</a></span> or how <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> committed <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note140790"><a href="../bible/exo002.htm#verse12">Exodus&nbsp;2:12</a></span> and plundered <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note140791"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse35">Exodus&nbsp;12:35-36</a></span> and waged <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and commanded, or himself perpetrated, many cruelties. <span class="stiki" id="note140792"><a href="../bible/exo017.htm#verse9">Exodus&nbsp;17:9</a></span> And he too was not content with one wife. We are neither directly nor remotely the authors of these and similar narratives, which are found in the books of the patriarchs and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Either your writers forged these things, or the fathers are really guilty. Choose which you please; the crime in either case is detestable, for vicious conduct and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> are equally hateful.</p>

<p>6. <em>Augustine</em> replied: You understand neither the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of the law nor the acts of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, because you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> or righteousness means. We have repeatedly shown at great length, that the precepts and <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> contained both what was to be fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and what was to be set aside as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of its having been fulfilled in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> now made manifest. For in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbor is secured the accomplishment of the precepts of the law, while the accomplishment of its promises is shown in the abolition of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and of other typical observances formerly practised. By the precept men were led, through a sense of guilt to desire <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; by the promise they were led to find in the typical observances the assurance that the Saviour would come. The <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> desired was to be obtained through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed on the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; and the fulfillment of the expectation rendered the types no longer necessary. The same law that was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> became <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the precept is kept in force in the case of those supported by divine help. By the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the symbolic <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> are set aside, that the promise might, in those who trust in the divine faithfulness, be brought to pass.</p>

<p>7. Those, accordingly, who, finding fault with what they do not understand, call the typical institutions of the law disfigurements and excrescences, are like men displeased with things of which they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the use. As if a deaf man, seeing others move their lips in speaking, were to find fault with the motion of the mouth as needless and unsightly; or as if a blind man, on hearing a house commended, were to test the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of what he heard by passing his hand over the surface of the wall, and on coming to the windows were to cry out against them as flaws in the level, or were to suppose that the wall had fallen in.</p>

<p>8. How shall I make those whose minds are full of vanity understand that the actions of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were also mystical and prophetic? The vanity of their minds is shown in their thinking that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> God to have once <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in darkness, because it is written, "Darkness was over the deep." <span class="stiki" id="note140793"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;1:2</a></span> As if we called the deep <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where there was darkness, because the light did not exist there before God made it by His word. From their not distinguishing between the light which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the light which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made, they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that God must have been in darkness before He made light, because darkness was over the deep before God said, "Let there be light, and there was light." In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> both these things are ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For we read, "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all;" <span class="stiki" id="note140794"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:5</a></span> and again, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts." <span class="stiki" id="note140795"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:6</a></span> So also, in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the name "Brightness of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light" <span class="stiki" id="note140796"><a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse26">Wisdom&nbsp;7:26</a></span> is given to the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which certainly was not created, for by it all things were made; and of the light which exists only as the production of this wisdom it is said, "You will light my candle, O Lord; my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, You will enlighten my darkness."  In the same way, in the beginning, when darkness was over the deep, God said, "Let there be light, and there was light," which only the light-giving light, which is God Himself, could have made.</p>

<p>9. For as God is His own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and is besides the bestower of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, so He is His own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light, and is also the bestower of light. He envies the good of none, for He is Himself the source of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to all good beings; He fears the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of none, for the loss of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beings is in their being abandoned by Him. He can neither be benefited by those on whom He Himself bestows <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, nor is He afraid of those whose misery is the doom awarded by His own judgment. Very different, O Manich&aelig;us, is the object of your worship. You have departed from God in the pursuit of your own fancies, which of all kinds have increased and multiplied in your foolish roving hearts, drinking in through the sense of sight the light of the heavenly bodies. This light, though it too is made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not to be compared to the light created in the minds of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, whom God brings out of darkness into light, as He brings them out of sinfulness into righteousness. Still less can it be compared to that inaccessible light from which all kinds of light are derived. Nor is this light inaccessible to all; for "blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." <span class="stiki" id="note140798"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all;" but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall not see light, as is said in Isaiah. <span class="stiki" id="note140799"><a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;8:20</a></span> To them the light-giving light is inaccessible. From the light comes not only the spiritual light in the minds of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, but also the material light, which is not denied to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but is made to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and on the good.</p>

<p>10. So, when darkness was over the deep, He who was light said, "Let there be light." From what light this light came is clear; for the words are, "God said." What light is that which was made, is not so clear. For there has been a friendly discussion among students of the sacred Scriptures, whether God then made the light in the minds of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or, in other words, these rational spirits themselves, or some material light which exists in the higher regions of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> beyond our ken. For on the fourth day He made the visible luminaries of heaven. And it is also a question whether these bodies were made at the same time as their light, or were somehow kindled from the light made already. But whoever reads the sacred writings in the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> spirit which is required to understand them, must be convinced that whatever the light was which was made when, at the time that darkness was over the deep, God said, "Let there be light," it was created light, and the creating Light was the maker of it.</p>

<p>11. Nor does it follow that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before He made light, abode in darkness, because it is said that darkness was over the deep, and then that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> moved on the waters. The deep is the unfathomable abyss of the waters. And the carnal mind might suppose that the Spirit abode in the darkness which was over the deep, because it is said that He moved on the waters. This is from not understanding how the light shines in darkness, and the darkness comprehends it not, till by the word of God those who were darkness are made light, and it is said to them, "You were once darkness, but now are you light in the Lord." <span class="stiki" id="note140800"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> But if rational minds which are in darkness through a sinful will cannot comprehend the light of the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though it is present everywhere, because they are separated from it not in place, but in disposition: why may not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> have moved on the darkness of the waters, when He moved on the waters, though at an immeasurable distance from it, not in place, but in nature?</p>

<p>12. In all this I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I am singing to deaf ears; but the Lord, from whom is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which we speak, can open some ears to catch the strain. But what shall we say of those critics of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> who object to God's being pleased with His own works, and find fault with the words, "God saw the light that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as if this meant that God admired the light as something new? God's seeing His works that they were good, means that the Creator approved of His own works as pleasing to Himself. For God cannot be forced to do anything against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, so that He should not be pleased with His own work; nor can He do anything by mistake, so that He should regret having done it. Why should the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> object to our God seeing His work that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, when their god placed a covering before himself when he mingled his own members with the darkness? For instead of seeing his work that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, he refuses to look at it because it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>13. Faustus speaks of our God as astonished, which is not said in Scripture; nor does it follow that one must be astonished when he sees anything to be good. There are many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which we see without being astonished, as if they were better than we expected; we merely approve of them as being what they ought to be. We can, however, give an instance of God being astonished, not from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> assail with undeserved reproach, but from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which they profess to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in order to entrap the unwary. For they acknowledge Christ as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and use this as a bait to entice Christ's followers into their snares. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, was astonished when Christ was astonished. For we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that when Christ heard the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of a certain centurion, He was astonished, and said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, "Verily I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, no, not in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140801"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;8:10</a></span> We have already given our explanation of the words, "God saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Better men may give a better explanation. Meanwhile  let the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> explain Christ's being astonished at what He foresaw before it happened, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> before He heard it. For though seeing a thing to be good is quite different from being astonished at it, in this case there is some resemblance, for Jesus was astonished at the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which He Himself had created in the heart of the centurion; for Jesus is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, which enlightens every man that comes into the world.</p>

<p>14. Thus an irreligious Pagan might bring the same reproaches against Christ in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, as Faustus brings against God in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. He might say that Christ lacked foresight, not only because He was astonished at the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the centurion, but because He chose Judas as a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> who <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> disobedient to His commands; as Faustus objects to the precept given in Paradise, which, as it turned out, was not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>. He might also cavil at Christ's not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> who touched Him, when the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> suffering from an issue of blood touched the hem of His garment; as Faustus blames God for not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> where <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had hid himself. If this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is implied in God's saying, "Where are you, Adam?" <span class="stiki" id="note140802"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse9">Genesis&nbsp;3:9</a></span> the same may be said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> asking, "Who touched me?" <span class="stiki" id="note140803"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;8:44-45</a></span> The Pagans also might call Christ timid and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, in not wishing five of the ten <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to gain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life by entering into His kingdom, and in shutting them out, so that they knocked in vain in their entreaty to have the door opened, as if forgetful of His own promise, "Knock, and it shall be opened unto you;" <span class="stiki" id="note140804"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;7:7</a></span> as Faustus charges God with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> in not admitting man after his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Again, he might call Christ greedy of the blood, not of beasts, but of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because he said, "He that loses his life for my sake, shall keep it unto life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>;" <span class="stiki" id="note140805"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;10:39</a></span> as Faustus reproaches God in reference to those animal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which prefigured the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of blood-shedding by which we are redeemed. He might also accuse Christ of jealousy, because in narrating His driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> quotes as applicable to Him the words, "The jealousy of Your house has eaten me up;" <span class="stiki" id="note140806"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;2:17</a></span> as Faustus accuses God of jealousy in forbidding <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to be offered to other gods. He might say that Christ was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with both His friends and His enemies: with His friends, because He said, "The servant that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his lord's will, and does it not, shall be beaten with many stripes;" and with His enemies, because He said, "If any one shall not receive you, shake off against him the dust of your shoes; verily I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> in the day of judgment than for that city;" <span class="stiki" id="note140807"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;10:14-15</a></span> as Faustus accuses God of being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at one time with His friends, and at another with His enemies; both of whom are spoken of thus by the apostle: "They that have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> without law shall perish without law, and they that have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in the law shall be judged by the law." <span class="stiki" id="note140808"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;2:12</a></span> Or he might say that Christ shed the blood of many without mercy, for a slight offense or for nothing. For to a Pagan there would appear to be little or no harm in not having a wedding garment at the marriage feast, for which our King in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> commanded a man to be bound hand and foot, and cast into outer darkness;  or in not wishing to have Christ for a king, which is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which Christ says, "Those that would not have me to reign over them, bring hither and slay before me;" <span class="stiki" id="note140810"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;19:27</a></span> as Faustus blames God in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> for slaughtering thousands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings for slight offenses, as Faustus calls them, or for nothing. Again, if Faustus finds fault with God's threatening to come with the sword, and to spare neither the righteous nor the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, might not the Pagan find as much fault with the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, when he says of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," He spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us all;" <span class="stiki" id="note140811"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;8:32</a></span> or of Peter, when, in exhorting the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to be patient in the midst of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and slaughter, he says, "It is time that judgment begin from the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not the gospel of the Lord? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?" <span class="stiki" id="note140812"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:17-18</a></span> What can be more righteous than the Only-Begotten, whom nevertheless the Father did not spare? And what can be plainer than that the righteous also are not spared, but chastised with manifold afflictions, as is clearly implied in the words, "If the righteous scarcely are saved"? As it is said in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, "Whom the Lord loves He corrects, and chastises every son whom He receives;" <span class="stiki" id="note140813"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;3:12</a></span> and, "If we receive good at the hand of the Lord, shall we not also receive <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?" <span class="stiki" id="note140814"><a href="../bible/job002.htm#verse10">Job&nbsp;2:10</a></span> So we read also in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, "Whom I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> I rebuke and chasten;" <span class="stiki" id="note140815"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse19">Revelation&nbsp;3:19</a></span> and, "If we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged of the Lord; but when we are judged, we are corrected of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world." <span class="stiki" id="note140816"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:31-32</a></span> If a Pagan were to make such objections to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, would not the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> try to answer them, though they themselves make similar objections to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>? But supposing them able to answer the Pagan, how absurd it would be to defend in the one Testament what they find fault with in the other! But if they could not answer the objections of the Pagan, why should they not allow in both Testaments, instead of in one only, that what appears wrong to unbelievers, from their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be right by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> readers even when they also are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>?</p>

<p>15. Perhaps our opponents will maintain that these parallel passages quoted from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are themselves neither authoritative nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: for they claim the impious liberty of holding and teaching, that whatever they deem favorable to their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was said by Christ and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; while they have the profane boldness to say, that whatever in the same writings is unfavorable to them is a spurious interpolation. I have already at some length, as far as the intention of the present work required, exposed the unreasonableness of this assault upon the authority of the whole of Scripture.</p>

<p>16. At present I would call attention to the fact, that when the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, although they disguise their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> absurdities under the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, bring such objections against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Scriptures, we have to defend the authority of the divine record in both Testaments against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> as much as against the Pagans. A Pagan might find fault with passages in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> in the same way as Faustus does with what he calls unworthy representations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; and the Pagan might be answered by the quotation of similar passages from his own authors, as in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> speech at Athens. <span class="stiki" id="note140817"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;17:28</a></span> Even in Pagan writings we might find the doctrine that God created and constructed the world, and that He is the giver of light, which does not imply that before light was made He abode in darkness; and that when His work was finished He was elated with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, which is more than saying that He saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and that He made a law with rewards for <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, and punishments for disobedience, by which they do not mean to say that God was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the future, because He gave a law to those by whom it was to be broken. Nor could they make asking questions a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a want of foresight even in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being; for in their books many questions are asked only for the purpose of using the answers for the conviction of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> addressed: for the questioner <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not only what answer he desires, but what will actually be given. Again, if the Pagan tried to make out God to be <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of any one, because He will not give <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, he would find many passages in the writings of his own authors in support of this principle of the divine government.</p>

<p>17. The only objection that a Pagan would make on the subject of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> would refer to our reason for finding fault with Pagan <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, when in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> God is described as requiring men to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to Him. If I were to reply at length on this subject, I might prove to him that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is due only to the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was offered by the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Priest, the Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and that it was proper that this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> should be pre-figured by animal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, in order to foreshadow the flesh and blood of the one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> contracted by flesh and blood, which shall not inherit the kingdom of God: for the natural body will be endowed with heavenly attributes, as the fire in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> typified the swallowing up of death in victory. Those observances properly belonged to the people whose kingdom and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> were prophetic of the King and Priest who should come to govern and to consecrate <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in all nations, and to lead them into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> society of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. And as this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was piously set forth in the Hebrew observances, so it was impiously caricatured by the Pagans, because, as the apostle says, what they offer they offer to devils, and not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140818"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:20</a></span> The typical rite of blood-shedding in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> dates from the earliest ages, pointing forward from the outset of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> history to the passion of the Mediator. For Abel is mentioned in the sacred Scripture as the first who offered such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140819"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;4:4</a></span> We need not therefore wonder that fallen <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who occupy the air, and whose chief <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, should demand from their worshippers by whom they wished to be considered as gods what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be due to God only. This deception was favored by the folly of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart, especially when regret for the dead led to the making of likenesses, and so to the use of images. <span class="stiki" id="note140820"><a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;14:15</a></span> By the increase of this homage, divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> came to be paid to the dead as dwelling in heaven, while devils took their place on earth as the objects of worship, and required that their deluded and degraded votaries should present <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to them. Thus the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> as due only to God appears not only when God righteously claims it, but also when a false god proudly arrogates it. If the Pagan was slow to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these things, I should argue from the prophecies, and point out that, though uttered long ago, they are now fulfilled. If he still remained in unbelief, this is rather to be expected than to be wondered at; for the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> itself intimates that all would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<p>18. If the Pagan, in the next place, were to find fault with both Testaments as attributing jealousy to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he would only show his own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of literature, or his forgetfulness. For though their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> distinguish between desire and passion, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and gratification, caution and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, gentleness and tender-heartedness, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and cunning, boldness and daring, and so on, giving the first name in each pair to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the second to what is bad, their books are notwithstanding full of instances in which, by the abuse of these words, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are called by the names which properly belong to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>; as passion is used for desire, gratification for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for caution, tender-heartedness for gentleness, cunning for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, daring for boldness. The cases are innumerable in which speech exhibits similar inaccuracies. Moreover, each language has its own idioms. For in religious writings I remember no instance of the word tender-heartedness being used in a bad sense. And common usage affords examples of similar peculiarities in the use of words. In Greek, one word stands for two distinct things, labor and pain; while we have a separate name for each. Again, we use the word in two senses, as when we say of what is not dead, that it has life; and again, of any one that he is a man of good life, whereas in Greek each of these meanings has a word of its own. So that, apart from the abuse of words which prevails in all languages, it may be an Hebrew idiom to use jealousy in two senses, as a man is called jealous when he suffers from a diseased state of mind caused by distress on account of the faithlessness of his wife, in which sense the word cannot be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or as when diligence is manifested in guarding conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, in which sense it is profitable for us not only unhesitatingly to admit, but thankfully to assert, that God is jealous of His people when He calls them His wife, and warns them against committing <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with a multitude of false gods. The same may be said of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For God does not suffer perturbation when He visits men in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; but either by an abuse of the word, or by a peculiarity of idiom, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is used in the sense of punishment.</p>

<p>19. The slaughter of multitudes would not seem strange to the Pagan, unless he denied the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which Pagans do not; for they allow that all things in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, from the highest to the lowest, are governed by God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. But if he would not allow this, he would be convinced either by the authority of Pagan writers, or by the more tedious method of demonstration; and if still obstinate and perverse, he would be left to the judgment which he denies. Then, if he were to give instances of the destruction of men for no offense, or for a very slight one, we should show that these were offenses, and that they were not slight. For instance, to take the case already referred to of the wedding garment, we should prove that it was a great crime in a man to attend the sacred feast, seeking not the bridegroom's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but his own, or whatever the garment may be found on better interpretation to signify. And in the case of the slaughter before the king of those who would not have him to reign over them, we might perhaps easily prove that, though it may be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in a man to refuse to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> his fellow-man, it is both a fault and a great one to reject the reign of Him in whose reign alone is there righteousness, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and continuance.</p>

<p>20. Lastly, as regards Faustus' crafty insinuation, that the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> misrepresents God as threatening to come with a sword which will spare neither the righteous nor the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, if the words were explained to the Pagan, he would perhaps disagree neither with the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> nor with the New; and he might see the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which people who pretend to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> either misunderstand from their blindness, or reject from their perversity. The great husbandman of the vine uses his pruning-hook differently in the fruitful and in the unfruitful branches; yet he spares neither good nor bad, pruning one and cutting off the other. <span class="stiki" id="note140821"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;15:1-3</a></span> There is no man so just as not to require to be tried by affliction to advance, or to establish, or to prove his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Do the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> not reckon <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> as righteous, who, while confessing humbly and honestly his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, still gives thanks for being justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>? Was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> then spared by Him whom fools misunderstand, when He says, "I will spare neither the righteous nor the sinner"? Hear the apostle himself: "Lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelation, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> to buffet me. For this I besought the Lord thrice, that He would remove it from me; and He said unto me, My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you: for strength is perfected in weakness." <span class="stiki" id="note140822"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:7-9</a></span> Here a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man is not spared that his strength might be perfected in weakness by Him who had given him an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> to buffet him. If you say that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> gave this <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> sought to prevent <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> being exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelation, and to perfect his strength. This is impossible. Therefore He who gave up this righteous man to be buffeted by the messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, is the same as He who, through <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, gave up to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> himself the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: "I have delivered them to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, that they may learn not to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140823"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:20</a></span> Do you see now how the Most High spares neither the righteous nor the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>? Or is it the sword that frightens you? For to be buffeted is not so bad as to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. But did not the thousands of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> suffer death in various forms? And could their persecutors have had this power against them except it had been given them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who thus spared neither the righteous nor the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>? For the Lord Himself, the chief <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, says expressly to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: "You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above." <span class="stiki" id="note140824"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;19:11</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also, besides recording his own experience, says that the afflictions and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of the righteous exhibit the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140825"><a href="../bible/2th001.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;1:5</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is set forth at length by the Apostle Peter in the passage already quoted, where he says: "It is time that judgment should begin at the house of the Lord. And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely are saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?" <span class="stiki" id="note140826"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:17-18</a></span> Peter also explains how the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are not spared, for they are branches broken off to be burnt; while the righteous are not spared, because their purification is to be brought to perfection. He ascribes these things to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him who says in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, I will spare neither the righteous nor the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; for he says: "It is better, if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> be so, that we suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing." <span class="stiki" id="note140827"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:17</a></span> So, when by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> men suffer for well-doing, the righteous are not spared; when they suffer for evil-doing, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are not spared. In both cases it is according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him who says: I will spare neither the righteous nor the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; correcting the one as a son, and punishing the other as a transgressor.</p>

<p>21. I have thus shown, to the best of my power, that the God we worship did not abide from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in darkness, but is Himself light, and in Him is no darkness at all; and in Himself dwells in light inaccessible; and the brightness of this light is His coeternal wisdom. From what we have said, it appears that God was not taken by surprise by the unexpected appearance of light, but that light owes its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to Him as its Creator, as its owes its continued <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to His approval. Neither was God <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the future, but the author of the precept as well as the punisher of disobedience; that by showing His righteous <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against transgression, He might provide a restraint for the time, and a warning for the future. Nor does He ask questions from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but by His very inquiry declares His judgment. Nor is He curious or timid, but excludes the transgressor from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, which is the just reward of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. Nor is He greedy for blood and fat; but by requiring from a carnal people <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, suited to their character, He by certain types prefigures the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. Nor is His jealousy an emotion of pale anxiety, but of quiet benevolence, in desire to keep the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which owes <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> to the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from being defiled and prostituted by serving many false gods. Nor is He enraged with a passion similar to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, not in the sense of desiring vengeance, but in the peculiar sense of giving full effect to the sentence of a righteous retribution. Nor does He destroy thousands of men for trifling offenses, or for nothing, but manifests to the world the benefit to be obtained from fearing Him, by the temporal death of those already mortal. Nor does He punish the righteous and sinners indiscriminately, but chastises the righteous for their good, in order to perfect them, and gives to sinners the punishment <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> due to them. Thus, you <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, do your suspicions lead you astray, when, by misunderstanding our Scriptures, or by hearing bad interpreters, you form a mistaken judgment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Hence you leave sound doctrine, and turn to impious fables; and in your perversity and estrangement from the society of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, you reject the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which, as we have shown, contains statements similar to those which you condemn in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. So we are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to defend both Testaments against you as well as against the Pagans.</p>

<p>22. But supposing that there is some one so deluded by carnality as to worship not the God whom we worship, who is one and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but the fiction of your suspicions or your <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a>, whom you say we worship, is not even this god better than yours? Observe, I beseech you, what must be plain to the feeblest understanding; for here there is no need of great perspicacity. I address all, wise and unwise. I appeal to the common sense and judgment of all alike. Hear, consider, judge. Would it not have been better for your god to have remained in darkness from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, than to have plunged the light coeternal with him and cognate to him into darkness? Would it not have been better to have expressed admiration in surprise at the appearance of a new light coming to scatter the darkness, than to have been unable to baffle the assault of darkness except by the concession of his own light? Unhappy if he did this in alarm, and cruel if there was no need of it. Surely it would have been better to see light, made by himself, and to admire it as good, than to make the light begotten by himself <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; better than that his own light should become hostile to himself in repelling the forces of darkness. For this will be the accusation against those who will be condemned for ever to the mass of darkness, that they suffered themselves to lose their original brightness, and became the enemies of sacred light. If they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> that they would be thus condemned, they must have suffered the darkness of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; or if they did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, the darkness of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Thus part of the substance of your god really did remain from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in its own darkness; and instead of admiring new light on its appearance, it only met with another and a hostile darkness, of which it had always been in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Indeed, God himself must have been in the darkness of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for this part of himself, if he was dreading the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> coming upon it. If he did not foresee the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he must have been in the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. If he foresaw it, and was not in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, the darkness of such cruelty is worse than the darkness either of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Your god appears to be destitute of the quality which the apostle commends in the body, which you insanely <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be made not by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by <em> Hyle</em>: "If one member suffers, all the members suffer with it." <span class="stiki" id="note140828"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:26</a></span> But suppose he did suffer; he foresaw, he feared, he suffered, but he could not help himself. Thus he remained from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in the darkness of his own misery; and then, instead of admiring a new light which was to drive away the darkness, he came in contact, to the injury of his own light, with another darkness which he had always dreaded. Again, would it not have been much better, I say, not to have given a commandment like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but even to have received a commandment like Adam, which he would be rewarded for keeping and punished for breaking, acting either way by his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, than to be forced by inevitable necessity to admit darkness into his light in spite of himself? Surely it would have been better to have given a precept to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it would become sinful, than to have been driven by necessity to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> contrary to his own divine nature. Think for a moment, and say how darkness could be conquered by one who was himself conquered by necessity. Conquered already by this greater enemy, he fought under his conqueror's orders against a less formidable opponent. Would it not have been better not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> where <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had hid himself, than to have been himself destitute of any means of escape, first from a hard and hateful necessity, and then from a dissimilar and hostile race? Would it not have been better to grudge <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, than to consign to misery the divine nature; to desire the blood and fat of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, than to be himself slaughtered in so many forms, on account of his mixture with the blood and fat of every victim; to be disturbed by jealousy at these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> being offered to other gods as well as to himself, than to be himself offered on all altars to all devils, as mixed up not only with all fruits, but also with all animals? Would it not have been much better to be affected even with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, so as to be enraged against both his friends and his enemies for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, than to be himself influenced by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> as well as by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> wherever these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> exist, or than to share in all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is committed, and in all punishment that is suffered? For this is the doom of that part of your god which is in confinement everywhere, condemned to this by himself, not as guilty, but in order to conquer his dreaded enemy. Doomed himself to such a fatal necessity, the part of himself which he has given over to condemnation might pardon him, if he were as <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> as he is miserable. But how can you pretend to find fault with God for His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against both friends and enemies when they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when the god of your fancies first under compulsion compels his own members to go to be devoured by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and then condemns them to remain in darkness?  Though he does this, you say that it will not be in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But will he not be ashamed to punish, or to appear to punish, those from whom he should ask pardon in words such as these: "Forgive me, I beseech you. You are my members; could I treat you thus, except from necessity? You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> yourselves, that you were sent here because a formidable enemy had arisen; and now you must remain here to prevent his rising again"? Again, is it not better to slay thousands of men for trifling faults, or for nothing, than to cast into the abyss of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and to condemn to the punishment of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> imprisonment, God's own members, his substance&mdash; in fact, God himself? It cannot properly be said of the real substance of God that it has the choice of sinning or not sinning, for God's substance is absolutely unchangeable. God cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as He cannot deny Himself. Man, on the contrary, can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and deny <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or he can choose not to do so. But suppose the members of your god had, like a rational <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the choice of sinning or not sinning; they might perhaps be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> punished for heinous offenses by confinement in the mass of darkness. But you cannot attribute to these parts a liberty which you deny to God himself. For if God had not given them up to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he would have been forced to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> himself, by the prevalence of the race of darkness. But if there was no danger of being thus forced, it was a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to send these parts to a place where they incurred this danger. To do so, indeed, from free choice is a crime deserving the torment which your god unnaturally inflicts upon his own parts, more than the conduct of these parts in going by his command to a place where they lost the power of living in righteousness. But if God himself was in danger of being forced to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by invasion and capture, unless he had secured himself first by the misconduct and then by the punishment of his own parts, there can have been no <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> either in your god or in his parts. Let him not set himself up as judge, but confess himself a criminal. For though he was forced against his own will, he professes to pass a righteous sentence in condemning those whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to have suffered <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> rather than done it; making this profession that he may not be thought of as having been conquered; as if it could do a beggar any good to be called prosperous and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. Surely it would have been better for your god to have spared neither righteous nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in indiscriminate punishment (which is Faustus' last charge against our God), than to have been so cruel to his own members&mdash;first giving them up to incurable contamination, and then, as if that was not enough, accusing them <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> of misconduct. Faustus declares that they <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> suffer this severe and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, because they allowed themselves to be led astray from their original brightness, and became hostile to sacred light. But the reason of this, as Faustus says, was that they were so greedily devoured in the first assault of the princes of darkness, that they were unable to recover themselves, or to separate themselves from the hostile principle. These <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, therefore, did no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> themselves, but in all this were innocent sufferers. The real agent was he who sent them away from himself into this wretchedness. They suffered more from their father than from their enemy. Their father sent them into all this misery; while their enemy desired them as something good, wishing not to hurt them, but to enjoy them. The one injured them knowingly, the other in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. This god was so weak and helpless that he could not otherwise secure himself first against an enemy threatening attack, and then against the same enemy in confinement. Let him, then, not condemn those parts whose <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> defended him, and whose death secures his safety. If he could not avoid the conflict, why <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> his defenders? When these parts allowed themselves to be led astray from their original brightness, and became hostile to sacred light, this must have been from the force of the enemy; and if they were forced against their will, they are innocent; while, if they could have resisted had they chosen, there is no need of the origin of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in an imaginary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> nature, since it is to be found in <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Their not resisting, when they could have done so, is plainly their own fault, and not owing to any force from without. For, supposing them able to do a thing, to do which is right, while not to do it is great and heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, their not doing it is their own choice. So, then, if they choose not to do it, the fault is in their will not in necessity. The origin of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the will; therefore in the will is also the origin of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, both in the sense of acting against a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> precept, and in the sense of suffering under a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> sentence. There is thus no reason why, in your search for the origin of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, you should fall into so great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as that of calling a nature so rich in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and of attributing the terrible <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of necessity to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of perfect good, before any commixture with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this erroneous belief is your <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which you need not have unless you choose; but in your wish to defend at all hazards the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> into which you have fallen, you take away the origin of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and place it in a fabulous nature of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And thus you come at last to say, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which are to be doomed to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> confinement in the mass of darkness became enemies to sacred light not from choice, but by necessity; and to make your god a judge with whom it is of no use to prove, in behalf of your clients. that they were under compulsion, and a king who will make no allowance for your brethren, his own sons and members, whose hostility against you and against himself you ascribe not to choice, but to necessity. What shocking cruelty! unless you proceed in the next place to defend your god, as also acting not from choice, but by necessity. So, if there could be found another judge free from necessity, who could decide the question on the principles of equity, he would sentence your god to be bound to this mass, not by being fastened on the outside, but by being shut up inside along with the formidable enemy. The first in the guilt of necessity ought to be first in the sentence of condemnation. Would it not be much better, then, in comparison with such a god as this, to choose the god whom we indeed do not worship, but whom you think or pretend to think we worship? Though he spares not his servants, whether righteous or sinful, making no proper separation, and not distinguishing between punishment and discipline, is he not better than the god who spares not his own members though innocent, if necessity is no crime, or guilty from their <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to him, if necessity itself is criminal; so that they are condemned <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> by him, along with whom they should have been released, if any liberty was recovered by the victory, while he should have been condemned along with them if the victory reduced the force of necessity even so far as to give this small amount of force to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>? Thus the god whom you represent us as worshipping, though he is not the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God whom we really worship, is far better than your god. Neither, indeed, has any <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; but both are the creatures of your imaginations. But, according to your own representations, the one whom you call ours, and find fault with, is better than the one whom you call your own, and whom you worship. </p>

<p>23. So also the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> whom you cry out against are not the men whom we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but men whose characters are drawn from your fancy, prompted by ill-will. And yet even thus as you paint them, I will not be content with showing them to be superior to your elect, who keep all the precepts of Manich&aelig;us, but will prove their superiority to your god himself. Before proving this, however, I must, with the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, defend our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> against your accusations, by a clear exposition of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as opposed to the carnality of your hearts. As for you <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, it would be enough to say that the faults you impute to our fathers are preferable to what you praise in your own, and to complete your shame by adding that your god can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> far inferior to our fathers as you describe them. This would be a sufficient reply for you. But as, even apart from your perversities, some minds are of themselves disturbed when comparing the life of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> with that of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in the New&mdash;not discerning between the manner of the time when the promise was under a veil, and that of the time when the promise is revealed,&mdash; I must first of all reply to those who either have the boldness to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves as superior in <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, or quote the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in defence of their own bad conduct.</p>

<p>24. First of all, then, not only the speech of these men, but their life also, was prophetic; and the whole kingdom of the Hebrews was like a great <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, corresponding to the greatness of the Person prophesied. So, as regards those Hebrews who were made wise in heart by divine instruction, we may discover a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the coming of Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, both in what they said and in what they did; and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as regards the divine procedure towards the whole nation as a body. For, as the apostle says, "all these things were our examples."</p>

<p>25. Those who find fault with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, accusing them of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> for instance, in actions which are above their comprehension, are like those Pagans who profanely charge Christ with folly or <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> because He looked for fruit from a tree out of the season; <span class="stiki" id="note140830"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;21:19</a></span> or with childishness, because He stooped down and wrote on the ground, and, after answering the people who were questioning Him, began writing again. <span class="stiki" id="note140831"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;8:6-8</a></span> Such critics are incapable of understanding that certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in great minds resemble closely the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of little minds, not in reality, but in appearance. Such criticism of the great is like that of boys at school, whose learning consists in the important rule, that if the nominative is in the singular, the verb must also be in the singular; and so they find fault with the best Latin author, because he says, <em>Pars in frusta secant</em>.  He should have written, say they, <em>secat</em>. And again, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that <em>religio</em> is spelt with one <em>l</em>, they blame him for writing <em>relligio</em>, when he says, <em>Relligione patrum</em>.  Hence it may with reason be said, that as the poetical usage of words differs from the solecisms and barbarisms of the unlearned, so, in their own way, the figurative actions of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> differ from the impure actions of the vicious. Accordingly, as a boy guilty of a barbarism would be whipped if he pled the usage of Virgil; so any one quoting the example of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> begetting a son from Hagar, in defence of his own sinful passion for his wife's handmaid, ought to be corrected not by caning only, but by severe scourging, that he may not suffer the doom of adulterers in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment. This indeed is a comparison of great and important subjects with trifles; and it is not intended that a peculiar usage in speech should be put on a level with a sacrament, or a solecism with <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Still, allowing for the difference in the character of the subjects, what is called learning or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in the proprieties and improprieties of speech, resembles wisdom or the want of it in reference to the grand moral distinction between <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. </p>

<p>26. Instead of entering on the distinctions between the praiseworthy and the blameworthy, the criminal and the innocent, the dangerous and the harmless, the guilty and the guiltless, the desirable and the undesirable, which are all illustrations of the distinction between <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and righteousness, we must first consider what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is, and then examine the actions of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as recorded in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> books, that, if we find these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> described as sinning, we may if possible discover the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason for keeping these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in memory by putting them on record. Again, if we find things recorded which, though they are not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, appear so to the foolish and the malevolent, and in fact do not exhibit any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, here also we have to see why these things are put into the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to contain wholesome doctrine as a guide in the present life, and a title to the inheritance of the future. As regards the examples of righteousness found among the acts of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the propriety of recording these must be plain even to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. The question is about those actions the mention of which may seem useless if they are neither righteous nor sinful, or even dangerous if the actions are really sinful, as leading people to imitate them, because they are not condemned in these books, and so may be supposed not to be sinful, or because, though they are condemned, men may copy them from the idea that they must be venial if <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> did them.</p>

<p>27. Sin, then, is any transgression in deed, or word, or desire, of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law. And the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law is the divine order or <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which requires the preservation of natural order, and forbids the breach of it. But what is this natural order in man? Man, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, consists of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; but so does a beast. Again, it is plain that in the order of nature the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is superior to the body. Moreover, in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man there is reason, which is not in a beast. Therefore, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is superior to the body, so in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself the reason is superior by the law of nature to the other parts which are found also in beasts; and in reason itself, which is partly <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and partly action, <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is unquestionably the superior part. The object of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which we are renewed through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to sight. Rational action ought therefore to be subject to the control of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, which is exercised through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> while we are absent from the Lord, as it will be hereafter through sight, when we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. <span class="stiki" id="note140835"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> Then in a spiritual body we shall by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be made equal to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, when we put on the garment of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and incorruption, with which this mortal and corruptible shall be clothed, that death may be swallowed up of victory, when righteousness is perfected through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and lofty <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have also their <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and action. They require of themselves the performance of the commands of Him whom they contemplate, whose <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> government they freely because sweetly <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. We, on the other hand, whose body is dead because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, till God quicken also our mortal bodies by His Spirit dwelling in us, live righteously in our feeble measure, according to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law in which the law of nature is preserved, when we live by that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, having in a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> a hope of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and incorruption laid up in heaven, and of the perfecting of righteousness to the measure of an inexpressible satisfaction, for which in our pilgrimage we must hunger and thirst, while we walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and not by sight.</p>

<p>28. A man, therefore, who acts in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which obeys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, restrains all mortal affections, and keeps them within the natural limit, regulating his desires so as to put the higher before the lower. If there was no pleasure in what is unlawful, no one would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. To <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to indulge this pleasure instead of restraining it. And by unlawful is meant what is forbidden by the law in which the order of nature is preserved. It is a great question whether there is any rational creature for which there is no pleasure in what is unlawful. If there is such a class of creatures, it does not include man, nor that angelic nature which abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. These rational creatures were so made, that they had the potentiality of restraining their desires from the unlawful; and in not doing this they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Great, then, is the creature man, for he is restored by this potentiality, by which, if he had so chosen, he would not have fallen. And great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, who created man. For He created also inferior natures which cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and superior natures which will not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Beasts do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for their nature agrees with the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law from being subject to it, without being in possession of it. And again, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because their heavenly nature is so in possession of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law that God is the only object of its desire, and they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> without any experience of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. But man, whose life on this earth is a trial on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, subdues to himself what he has in common with beasts, and subdues to God what he has in common with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; till, when righteousness is perfected and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> attained, he shall be raised from among beasts and ranked with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>29. The exercise or indulgence of the bodily appetites is intended to secure the continued <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and the invigoration of the individual or of the species. If the appetites go beyond this, and carry the man, no longer master of himself, beyond the limits of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, they become unlawful and shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, which severe discipline must subdue. But if this unbridled course ends in plunging the man into such a depth of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> habits that he supposes that there will be no punishment of his sinful <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and so refuses the wholesome discipline of confession and repentance by which he might be rescued; or, from a still worse insensibility, justifies his own indulgences in profane opposition to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law of Providence; and if he dies in this state, that unerring law sentences him now not to correction, but to damnation.</p>

<p>30. Referring, then, to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law which enjoins the preservation of natural order and forbids the breach of it, let us see how our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, that is, how he broke this law, in the things which Faustus has charged him with as highly criminal. In his irrational craving to have children, says Faustus, and not believing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who promised that his wife Sara should have a son, he defiled himself with a mistress. But here Faustus, in his irrational desire to find fault, both discloses the impiety of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and in his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> praises <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> intercourse with the handmaid. For as the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law&mdash; that is, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Creator of all&mdash; for the preservation of the natural order, permits the indulgence of the bodily appetite under the guidance of reason in sexual intercourse, not for the gratification of passion, but for the continuance of the race through the procreation of children; so, on the contrary, the unrighteous law of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, in order to prevent their god, whom they bewail as confined in all seeds, from suffering still closer confinement in the womb, requires married people not on any account to have children, their great desire being to liberate their god. Instead, therefore, of an irrational craving in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to have children, we find in Manich&aelig;us an irrational fancy against having children. So the one preserved the natural order by seeking in marriage only the production of a child; while the other, influenced by his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> notions, thought no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> could be greater than the confinement of his god.</p>

<p>31. So, again, when Faustus says that the wife's being privy to her husband's conduct made the matter worse, while he is prompted only by the uncharitable wish to reproach <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and his wife, he really, without intending it, speaks in praise of both. For Sara did not connive at any criminal action in her husband for the gratification of his unlawful <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; but from the same natural desire for children that he had, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> her own barrenness, she warrantably claimed as her own the fertility of her handmaid; not consenting with sinful desires in her husband, but requesting of him what it was proper in him to grant. Nor was it the request of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> assumption; for every one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the duty of a wife is to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> her husband. But in reference to the body, we are told by the apostle that the wife has power over her husband's body, as he has over hers; <span class="stiki" id="note140836"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:4</a></span> so that, while in all other social matters the wife ought to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> her husband, in this one matter of their bodily connection as man and wife their power over one another is mutual&mdash;the man over the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> over the man. So, when Sara could not have children of her own, she wished to have them by her handmaid, and of the same seed from which she herself would have had them, if that had been possible. No <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> would do this if her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for her husband were merely an animal passion; she would rather be jealous of a mistress than make her a mother. So here the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> desire for the procreation of children was an indication of the absence of criminal indulgence.</p>

<p>32. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, indeed, cannot be defended, if, as Faustus says, he wished to get children by Hagar, because he had no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who promised that he should have children by Sara. But this is an entire mistake: this promise had not yet been made. Any one who reads the preceding chapters will find that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had already got the promise of the land with a countless number of inhabitants, <span class="stiki" id="note140837"><a href="../bible/gen012.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;12:3</a></span> but that it had not yet been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him how the seed spoken of was to be produced, whether by generation from his own body, or from his choice in the adoption of a son, or, in the case of its being from his own body, whether it would be by Sara or another. Whoever examines into this will find that Faustus has made either an imprudent mistake or an impudent misrepresentation. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, then, when he saw that he had no children, though the promise was to his seed, thought first of adoption. This appears from his saying of his slave, when speaking to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "This is mine heir;" as much as to say, As You have not given me a seed of my own, fulfill Your promise in this man. For the word seed may be applied to what has not come out of a man's own body, else the apostle could not call us the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: for we certainly are not his descendants in the flesh; but we are his seed in following his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by believing in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whose flesh did spring from the flesh of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Then <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was told by the Lord "This shall not be your heir; but he that comes out of your own bowels shall be your heir." <span class="stiki" id="note140838"><a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;15:3-4</a></span> The thought of adoption was thus removed; but it still remained uncertain whether the seed which was to come from himself would be by Sara or another. And this God was pleased to keep concealed, till a figure of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> had been supplied in the handmaid. We may thus easily understand how <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, seeing that his wife was barren, and that she desired to obtain from her husband and her handmaid the offspring which she herself could not produce, acted not in compliance with carnal appetite, but in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to conjugal authority, believing that Sara had the sanction of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for her wish; because God had already promised him an heir from his own body, but had not foretold who was to be the mother. Thus, when Faustus shows his own infidelity in accusing <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> of unbelief, his groundless accusation only proves the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of the assailant. In other cases, Faustus' infidelity has prevented him from understanding; but here, in his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>, he has not even taken time to read.</p>

<p>33. Again, when Faustus accuses a righteous and faithful man of a shameless profanation of his marriage from <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and greed, by selling his wife Sara at different times to the two kings Abimelech and <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, telling them that she was his sister, because she was very fair, he does not distinguish <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> between right and wrong, but <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> condemns the whole transaction. Those who think that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> sold his wife cannot discern in the light of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law the difference between <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and righteousness; and so they call perseverance obstinacy, and confidence presumption, as in these and similar cases men of wrong judgment are wont to blame what they suppose to be wrong actions. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> did not become partner in crime with his wife by selling her to others: but as she gave her handmaid to her husband, not to gratify his passion, but for the sake of offspring, in the authority she had consistently with the order of nature, requiring the performance of a duty, not complying with a sinful desire; so in this case, the husband, in perfect assurance of the chaste attachment of his wife to himself, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> her mind to be the abode of modest and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> affection, called her his sister, without saying that she was his wife, lest he himself should be killed, and his wife fall into the hands of strangers and evil-doers: for he was assured by his God that He would not allow her to suffer <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> or disgrace. Nor was he disappointed in his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope; for <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, terrified by strange occurrences, and after enduring many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> on account of her, when he was informed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that Sara was <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> wife, restored her with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> uninjured. Abimelech also did the same, after learning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>.</p>

<p>34. Some people, not scoffers and evil-speakers like Faustus, but men who pay due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, which Faustus finds fault with because he does not understand them, or which he fails to understand because of his fault-finding, in commenting on this act of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, are of opinion that he stumbled from weakness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and denied his wife from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, as Peter denied the Lord. If this is the correct view, we must allow that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should not cancel or obliterate all his merits, any more than in the case of the apostle. Besides, to deny his wife is not the same as to deny the Saviour. But when there is another explanation, why not abide by it, instead of giving blame without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, since there is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> told a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? He did not deny that Sara was his wife in answer to any question on the subject; but when asked who she was, he said she was his sister, without denying her to be his wife: he concealed part of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but said nothing false.</p>

<p>35. It is waste of time to observe Faustus' remark, that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> called Sara his sister; as if Faustus had discovered the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Sara, though it is not mentioned in Scripture. In a matter which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, and we do not, it is surely better to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the patriarch when he says what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, than to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Manich&aelig;us when he finds fault with what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing about. Since, then, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> lived at that period in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> history, when, though marriage had become unlawful between children of the same <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or of the same father or mother, no law or authority interfered with the custom of marriage between the children of brothers, or any less degree of consanguinity, why should he not have had as wife his sister, that is, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> descended from his father? For he himself told the king, when he restored Sara, that she was his sister by his father, and not by his mother. And on this occasion he could not have been led to tell a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, for the king <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that she was his wife, and was restoring her with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, because he had been warned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We learn from Scripture that, among the ancients, it was customary to call cousins brothers and sisters. Thus Tobias says in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before having intercourse with his wife, "And now, O Lord, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that not in wantonness I take to wife my sister;" <span class="stiki" id="note140839"><a href="../bible/tob008.htm#verse9">Tobit&nbsp;8:9</a></span> though she was not sprung immediately from the same father or the same mother, but only belonged to the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. And <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> is called the brother of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, though <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was his uncle.  And, by the same use of the word, those called in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the Lord's brothers are certainly not children of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, but all the blood relations of the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note140841"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;12:46</a></span> </p>

<p>36. Some may say, Why did not <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> confidence in God prevent his being afraid to confess his wife? God could have warded off from him the death which he feared, and could have protected both him and his wife while among strangers, so that Sara, although very fair, should not have been desired by any one, nor <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> killed on account of her. Of course, God could have done this; it would be absurd to deny it. But if, in reply to the people, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had told them that Sara was his wife, his trust in God would have included both his own life and the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of Sara. Now it is part of sound doctrine, that when a man has any means in his power, he should not tempt the Lord his God. So it was not because the Saviour was unable to protect His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that He told them, "When you are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> in one city, flee to another." <span class="stiki" id="note140842"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;10:23</a></span> And He Himself set the example. For though He had the power of laying down His own life, and did not lay it down till He chose to do so, still when an infant He fled to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, carried by His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note140843"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;2:14</a></span> and when He went up to the feast, He went not openly, but secretly, though at other times He spoke openly to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who in spite of their rage and hostility could not lay hands on Him, because His hour was not come, &mdash; not the hour when He would be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to die, but the hour when He would consider it seasonable to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. Thus He who displayed divine power by teaching and reproving openly, without allowing the rage of his enemies to hurt Him, did also, by escaping and concealing Himself, exhibit the conduct becoming the feebleness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that they should not tempt God when they have any means in their power of escaping threatened danger. So also in the apostle, it was not from despair of divine assistance and protection, or from loss of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that he was let down over the wall in a basket, in order to escape being taken by his enemies: <span class="stiki" id="note140845"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse25">Acts&nbsp;9:25</a></span> not from want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in God did he thus escape, but because not to escape, when this escape was possible, would have been tempting God. Accordingly, when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was among strangers, and when, on account of the remarkable beauty of Sara, both his life and her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> were in danger, since it was in his power to protect not both of these, but one only&mdash;his life, namely,&mdash; to avoid tempting God he did what he could; and in what he could not do, he trusted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Unable to conceal his being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he concealed his being a husband, lest he should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>; trusting to God to preserve his wife's purity.</p>

<p>37. There might also be a difference of opinion on the nice point whether Sara's <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> would have been violated even if some one had intercourse with her, since she submitted to this to save her husband's life, both with his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and by his authority. In this there would be no desertion of conjugal fidelity or rebellion against her husband's authority; in the same way as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was not an adulterer, when, in submission to the lawful authority of his wife, he consented to be made a father by his wife's handmaid. But, from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the relationship, for a wife to have two husbands, both in life, is not the same thing as for a man to have two wives: so that we regard the explanation already given of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> conduct as the most correct and unobjectionable; that our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> avoided tempting God by taking what measures he could for the preservation of his own life, and that he showed his hope in God by entrusting to Him the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of his wife.</p>

<p>38. But a pleasure which all must feel is obtained from this narrative so faithfully recorded in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, when we examine into the prophetic character of the action, and knock with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and diligence at the door of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, that the Lord may open, and show us who was prefigured in the ancient personage, and whose wife this is, who, while in a foreign land and among strangers, is not allowed to be stained or defiled, that she may be brought to her own husband without spot or wrinkle. Thus we find that the righteous life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that her beauty may bring <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to her husband, as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> on account of the beauty of Sara among the inhabitants of that foreign land. To the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to whom it is said in the Song of Songs, "O you fairest among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note140846"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse7">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;1:7</a></span> kings offer gifts in acknowledgment of her beauty; as king Abimelech offered gifts to Sara, admiring the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of her appearance; all the more that, while he loved, he was not allowed to profane it. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, too is in secret the spouse of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>. For it is secretly, and in the hidden depths of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man is joined to the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that they two are one flesh; of which the apostle speaks as a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> in marriage, as referring to Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140847"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse31">Ephesians&nbsp;5:31-32</a></span> Again, the earthly kingdom of this world, typified by the kings which were not allowed to defile Sara, had no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or experience of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, of how faithfully she maintained her relation to her Husband, till it tried to violate her, and was compelled to yield to the divine testimony borne by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and in the person of later monarchs was brought humbly to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> with gifts the Bride whom their predecessors had not been able to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> by subduing her to themselves. What, in the type, happened in the reign of one and the same king, is fulfilled in the earlier monarchs of this era and their successors.</p>

<p>39. Again, when it is said that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the sister of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not by the mother but by the father, we learn the excellence of the relation, which is not of the temporary nature of earthly descent, but of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, which is everlasting. By this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we shall no longer be a race of mortals when we receive power to be called and to become sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we obtain not from the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, which is the mother of Christ after the flesh, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. And when Christ calls us into another life where there is no death, He teaches us, instead of acknowledging, to deny the earthly relationship, where death soon follows upon birth; for He says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, "Call no man your father upon earth; for you have one Father, who is in heaven." <span class="stiki" id="note140848"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;23:9</a></span> And He set us an example of this when He said, "Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? And stretching forth His hand to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, He said, These are my brethren." And lest any one should think that He referred to an earthly relationship, He added, "Whosoever shall do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my Father, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother;" <span class="stiki" id="note140849"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse48">Matthew&nbsp;12:48-50</a></span> as much as to say, I derive this relationship from God my Father, not from the Synagogue my mother; I call you to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, where I have an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> birth, not to earthly life, for to call you away from this life I have taken mortality.</p>

<p>40. As for the reason why, though it is concealed among strangers whose wife the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is, it is not hidden whose sister she is, it is plainly because it is obscure and hard to understand how the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> are united or mingled, or whatever word may be used to express this connection between God and the creature. It is from this connection that Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are called bridegroom and bride, or husband and wife. The other relationship, in which Christ and all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are brethren by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> and not by earthly consanguinity, or by the father and not by the mother, is more easily expressed in words, and more easily understood. For the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> makes all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to be also brethren of one another; while in their society no one is the bridegroom of all the rest. So also, notwithstanding the surpassing <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, His manhood was much more plainly and readily recognized by strangers, who, indeed, were not wrong in believing Him to be man, but they did not understand His being God as well as man. Hence Jeremiah says: "He is both a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and who shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him?" <span class="stiki" id="note140850"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse9">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:9</a></span> He is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for it is made manifest that He is a brother. And who shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him? For it is concealed that He is a husband. This must suffice as a defense of our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> against Faustus' impudence and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.</p>

<p>41. <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> also, the brother of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, was just and hospitable in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and was found worthy to escape the conflagration which prefigured the future judgment; for he was free from all participation in the corruption of the people of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>. He was a type of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which in the person of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> both groans now among the ungodly and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, to whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> it does not consent, and will at the end of the world be rescued from their society, when they are doomed to the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>. <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife was the type of a different class of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash;of those, namely, who, when called by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, look back, instead of, like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, forgetting the things that are behind, and looking forward to the things that are before. <span class="stiki" id="note140851"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> The Lord Himself says: "No man that puts his hand to the plough, and looks back, is fit for the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140852"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke&nbsp;9:62</a></span> Nor did He omit to mention the case of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife; for she, for our warning, was turned into a pillar of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, that being thus seasoned we might not trifle thoughtlessly with this danger, but be on our guard against it. So, when the Lord was admonishing every one to get rid of the things that are behind by the most strenuous endeavor to reach the things that are before, He said, "Remember <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife." <span class="stiki" id="note140853"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;17:32</a></span> And, in addition to these, there is still a third type in <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, when his daughters lay with him. For here <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> seems to prefigure the future law; for those who spring from the law, and are placed under the law, by misunderstanding it, stupefy it, as it were, and bring forth the works of unbelief by an unlawful use of the law. "The law is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" says the apostle, "if a man use it lawfully." <span class="stiki" id="note140854"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:8</a></span> </p>

<p>42. It is no excuse for this action of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> or of his daughters that it represented the perversity which was afterwards in certain cases to be displayed. The purpose of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> daughters is one thing, and the purpose of God is another, in allowing this to happen that He might make some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> manifest; for God both pronounces judgment on the actions of the people of those times, and arranges in His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> for the prefigurement of the future. As a part of Scripture, this action is a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; as part of the history of those concerned, it is a crime.</p>

<p>43. At the same time there is in this transaction no reason for the torrent of abuse which Faustus' blind hostility discharges on it. By the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law which requires the preservation of the order of nature and condemns its violation, the judgment in this case is not what it would have been if <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> had been prompted by a criminal passion to commit incest with his daughters, or if they had been inflamed with unnatural desires. In <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, we must ask not only what was done, but with what motive, in order to obtain a fair view of the action as the effect of that motive. The resolution of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> daughters to lie with their father was the effect of the natural desire for offspring in order to preserve the race; for they supposed that there were no other men to be found, thinking that the whole world had been consumed in that conflagration, which, for all they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, had left no one alive but themselves. It would have been better for them never to have been mothers, than to have become mothers by their own father. But still, the fulfillment of a desire like this is very different from the accursed gratification of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.</p>

<p>44. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> that their father would condemn their design, <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> daughters thought it necessary to fulfill it without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. We are told that they made him drunk, so that he was unaware of what happened. His guilt therefore is not that of incest, but of <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>. This, too, is condemned by the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law, which allows meat and drink only as required by nature for the preservation of health. There is, indeed, a great difference between a drunk man and an habitual drunkard; for the drunkard is not always drunk, and a man may be drunk on one occasion without being a drunkard. However, in the case of a righteous man, we require to account for even one instance of <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>. What can have made <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> consent to receive from his daughters all the cups of wine which they went on mixing for him, or perhaps giving him unmixed? Did they feign excessive grief, and did he resort to this consolation in their loneliness, and in the loss of their mother, thinking that they were drinking too, while they only pretended to drink? But this does not seem a proper method for a righteous man to take in consoling his friends when in trouble. Had the daughters learned in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> some vile art which enabled them to intoxicate their father with a few cups, so that in his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> he might <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or rather be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against? But it is not likely that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> would have omitted all notice of this, or that God would have allowed His servant to be thus abused without any fault of his own.</p>

<p>45. But we are defending the sacred Scriptures, not man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Nor are we concerned to justify this action, as if our God had either commanded it or approved of it; or as if, when men are called just in Scripture, it meant that they could not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if they chose. And as, in the books which those critics find fault with, God nowhere expresses approval of this action, what thoughtless folly it is to bring a charge from this narrative against these writings, when in other places such actions are condemned by express prohibitions! In the story of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> daughters the action is related, not commended. And it is proper that the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> should be declared in some cases, and concealed in others, that by its manifestation our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> may be enlightened, and that by its concealment our minds may be improved by the exercise of recalling what we already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, or our indolence stimulated to seek for an explanation. Here, then, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who can bring good out of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, made nations arise from this origin, as He saw good, but did not bring upon His own Scriptures the guilt of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It is God's writing, but not His doing; He does not propose these things for our imitation, but holds them up for our warning.</p>

<p>46. Faustus' effrontery appears notably in his accusing Isaac also, the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> of pretending that his wife Rebecca was his sister. <span class="stiki" id="note140855"><a href="../bible/gen026.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;26:7</a></span> For as regards the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Rebecca Scripture is not silent, and it appears that she was his sister in the well-known sense of the word. His concealing that she was his wife is not surprising, nor is it insignificant, if he did it in imitation of his father, so that he can be justified on the same grounds. We need only refer to the answer already given to Faustus' charge against <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, as being equally applicable to Isaac. Perhaps, however some inquirer will ask what typical significance there is in the foreign king discovering Rebecca to be the wife of Isaac by seeing him playing with her; for he would not have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, had he not seen Isaac playing with Rebecca as it would have been improper to do with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> not his wife. When <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men act thus as husbands, they do it not foolishly, but designedly: for they accommodate themselves to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the weaker sex in words and actions of gentle playfulness; not in effeminacy, but in subdued manliness. But such behavior towards any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> except a wife would be disgraceful. This is a question in good manners, which is referred to only in case some stern advocate of insensibility should find fault with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man even for playing with his wife. For if these men without humanity see a sedate man chatting playfully with children that he may adapt himself to the childish understanding with kindly sympathy, they think that he is insane; forgetting that they themselves were once children, or unthankful for their maturity. The typical meaning, as regards Christ and His Church, which is to be found in this great patriarch playing with his wife, and in the conjugal relation being thus discovered, will be seen by every one who, to avoid offending the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by erroneous doctrine, carefully studies in Scripture the secret of the Church's Bridegroom. He will find that the Husband of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> concealed for a time in the form of a servant the majesty in which He was equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that feeble humanity might be capable of union with Him, and that so He might accommodate Himself to His spouse. So far from being absurd, it has a symbolic suitableness that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of God should use a playfulness which is of the flesh to meet the affection of his wife, as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> Himself became flesh that He might dwell among us.</p>

<p>47. Again, Jacob the son of Isaac is charged with having committed a great crime because he had four wives. But here there is no ground for a criminal accusation: for a plurality of wives was no crime when it was the custom; and it is a crime now, because it is no longer the custom. There are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against nature, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against custom, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. In which, then, of these senses did Jacob <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in having a plurality of wives? As regards nature, he used the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> not for sensual gratification, but for the procreation of children. For custom, this was the common practice at that time in those countries. And for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, no prohibition <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. The only reason of its being a crime now to do this, is because custom and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> forbid it. Whoever despises these restraints, even though he uses his wives only to get children, still commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and does an injury to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society itself, for the sake of which it is that the procreation of children is required. In the present altered state of customs and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, men can have no pleasure in a plurality of wives, except from an excess of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; and so the mistake arises of supposing that no one could ever have had many wives but from sensuality and the vehemence of sinful desires. Unable to form an idea of men whose force of mind is beyond their conception, they compare themselves with themselves, as the apostle says, <span class="stiki" id="note140856"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:12</a></span> and so make mistakes. Conscious that, in their intercourse though with one wife only, they are often influenced by mere animal passion instead of an intelligent motive, they think it an obvious inference that, if the limits of moderation are not observed where there is only one wife, the infirmity must be aggravated where there are more than one.</p>

<p>48. But those who have not the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> must not be allowed to judge of the conduct of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, any more than those in fever of the sweetness and wholesomeness of food. Nourishment must be provided not by the dictates of the sickly taste, but rather by the judgment and direction of health, so as to cure the sickness. If our critics, then, wish to attain not a spurious and affected, but a genuine and sound moral health, let them find a cure in believing the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> record, that the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> name of saint is given not without reason to men who had several wives; and that the reason is this, that the mind can exercise such control over the flesh as not to allow the appetite implanted in our nature by Providence to go beyond the limits of deliberate intention. By a similar misunderstanding, this criticism, which consists rather in dishonest <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> than in honest judgment, might accuse the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> too of preaching the gospel to so many people, not from the desire of begetting children to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, but from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise. There was no lack of renown to these our fathers in the gospel, for their praise was spread in numerous tongues through the churches of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In fact, no greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> could have been paid by men to their fellow-creatures. It was the sinful desire for this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which led the reprobate Simon in his blindness to wish to purchase for money what was freely bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140857"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse18">Acts&nbsp;8:18-20</a></span> There must have been this desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the man whom the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> checks in his desire to follow Him, saying, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> has not where to lay His Head." <span class="stiki" id="note140858"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;8:20</a></span> The Lord saw that his mind was darkened by false appearances and elated by sudden emotion, and that there was no ground of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to afford a lodging to the Teacher of humility; for in Christ's discipleship the man sought not Christ's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. By this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> those were led away whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> characterizes as preaching Christ not sincerely, but of contention and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; and yet the apostle rejoices in their preaching, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it might happen that, while the preachers gratified their desire for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise, <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> might be born among their hearers&mdash;not as the result of the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> feeling which made them wish to rival or surpass the fame of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but by means of the gospel which they preached, though not sincerely; so that God might bring good out of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. So a man may be induced to marry by sensual desire, and not to beget children; and yet a child may be born, a good work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, due to the natural power, not to the misconduct of the parent. As, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were gratified when their doctrine met with acceptance from their hearers, not because they were greedy for praise, but because they desired to spread the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; so the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patriarchs in their conjugal intercourse were actuated not by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of pleasure, but by the intelligent desire for the continuance of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Thus the number of their hearers did not make the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> ambitious; nor did the number of their wives make the patriarchs licentious. But why defend the husbands, to whose character the divine word bears the highest testimony, when it appears that the wives themselves looked upon their connection with their husbands only as a means of getting sons? So, when they found themselves barren, they gave their handmaids to their husbands; so that while the handmaids had the fleshly motherhood, the wives were mothers in intention.</p>

<p>49. Faustus makes a most groundless statement when he accuses the four <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of quarreling like abandoned characters for the possession of their husband. Where Faustus read this I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, unless it was in his own heart, as in a book of impious delusions, in which Faustus himself is seduced by that serpent with regard to whom the apostle feared for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which he desired to present as a chaste virgin to Christ; lest, as the serpent had deceived Eve by his subtlety, so he should also corrupt their minds by turning them away from the simplicity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140859"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:2-3</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> are so fond of this serpent, that they assert that he did more good than harm. From him Faustus must have got his mind corrupted with the lies instilled into it, which he now reproduces in these <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, and is even bold enough to put down in writing. It is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that one of the handmaids carried off Jacob from the other, or that they quarreled about possessing him. There was arrangement, because there was no licentious passion; and the law of conjugal authority was all the stronger that there was none of the lawlessness of fleshly desire. His being hired by one of his wives proves what is here said, in plain opposition to the libels of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>. Why should one have hired him, unless by the arrangement he was to have gone in to the other? It does not follow that he would never have gone in to Leah unless she had hired him. He must have gone to her always in her turn, for he had many children by her; and in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to her he had children by her hand-maid, and afterwards, without any hiring, by herself. On this occasion it was Rachel's turn, so that she had the power so expressly mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> by the apostle, "The husband has not power over his own body, but the wife." <span class="stiki" id="note140860"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:4</a></span> Rachel had a bargain with her sister, and, being in her sister's debt, she referred her to Jacob, her own debtor. For the apostle uses this figure when he says, "Let the husband render unto the wife what is due." <span class="stiki" id="note140861"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:3</a></span> Rachel gave what was in her power as due from her husband, in return for what she had chosen to take from her sister.</p>

<p>50. If Jacob had been of such a character as Faustus in his incurable blindness supposes, and not a servant of righteousness rather than of concupiscence, would he not have been looking forward eagerly all day to the pleasure of passing the night with the more beautiful of his wives, whom he certainly loved more than the other, and for whom he paid the price of twice seven years of gratuitous service? How, then, at the close of the day, on his way to his beloved, could he have consented to be turned aside, if he had been such as the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> represent him? Would he not have disregarded the wish of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and insisted upon going to the fair Rachel, who belonged to him that night not only as his lawful wife, but also as coming in regular order? He would thus have used his power as a husband, for the wife also has not power over her own body, but the husband; and having on this occasion the arrangement in their <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> in favor of the gratification of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of beauty, he might have enforced his authority the more successfully. In that case it would be to the credit of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, that while he thought of his own pleasure they contended about having a son. As it was, this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> man, in manly control of sensual appetite, thought more of what was due from him than to him, and instead of using his power for his own pleasure, consented to be only the debtor in this mutual obligation. So he consented to pay the debt to the person to whom she to whom it was due wished him to pay it. When, by this private bargain of his wives, Jacob was suddenly and unexpectedly forced to turn from the beautiful wife to the plain one, he did not give way either to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or to disappointment, nor did he try to persuade his wives to let him have his own way; but, like a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> husband and an intelligent parent, seeing his wives concerned about the production of children, which was all he himself desired in marriage, he thought it best to yield to their authority, in desiring that each should have a child: for, since all the children were his, his own authority was not impaired. As if he had said to them: Arrange as you please among yourselves which is to be the mother; it matters not to me, since in any case I am the father. This control over the appetites, and simple desire to beget children, Faustus would have been clever enough to see and approve, unless his mind had been corrupted by the shocking tenets of his <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, which lead him to find fault with everything in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, and, moreover, teach him to condemn as the greatest crime the procreation of children, which is the proper design of marriage.</p>

<p>51. Now, having defended the character of the patriarch, and refuted an accusation arising from these detestable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, let us avail ourselves of the opportunity of searching out the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> meaning, and let us knock with the reverence of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that the Lord may open to us the typical significance of the four wives of Jacob, of whom two were free, and two slaves. We see that, in the wife and bond-slaves of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the apostle understands the two Testaments. <span class="stiki" id="note140862"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;4:22-24</a></span> But there, one represents each; here, the application does not suit so well, as there are two and two. There, also, the son of the bond-slave is disinherited; but here the sons of the slaves receive the land of promise along with the sons of the free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: so that this type must have a different meaning.</p>

<p>52. Supposing that the two free wives point to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, by which we are called to liberty, what is the meaning of there being two? Perhaps because in Scripture, as the attentive reader will find, we are said to have two lives in the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash;one temporal, in which we suffer pain, and one <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, in which we shall behold the blessedness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We see the one in the Lord's passion, and the other in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. The names of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> point to this meaning: It is said that Leah means Suffering, and Rachel the First Principle made visible, or the Word which makes the First Principle visible. The action, then, of our mortal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, in which we live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, doing many painful tasks without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what benefit may result from them to those in whom we are interested, is Leah, Jacob's first wife. And thus she is said to have had weak eyes. For the purposes of mortals are timid, and our plans uncertain. Again, the hope of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, accompanied with a sure and delightful perception of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is Rachel. And on this account she is described as fair and well-formed. This is the beloved of every <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> student, and for this he serves the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, though like scarlet, are made white as snow. <span class="stiki" id="note140863"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;1:18</a></span> For Laban means making white; and we read that Jacob served Laban for Rachel. <span class="stiki" id="note140864"><a href="../bible/gen029.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;29:17</a></span> No man turns to serve righteousness, in subjection to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of forgiveness, but that he may live in peace in the Word which makes visible the First Principle, or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that is, he serves for Rachel, not for Leah. For what a man loves in the works of righteousness is not the toil of doing and suffering. No one desires this life for its own sake; as Jacob desired not Leah, who yet was brought to him, and became his wife, and the mother of children. Though she could not be loved of herself, the Lord made her be borne with as a step to Rachel; and then she came to be approved of on account of her children. Thus every useful servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, brought into His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by which his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are made white, has in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and heart, and affection, when he thus turns to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nothing but the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of wisdom. This we often expect to attain as a reward for practising the seven precepts of the law which concern the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of our neighbor, that we injure no one: namely, Honor your father and mother; You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; You shall not kill; You shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>; You shall not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; You shall not desire your neighbor's wife; You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> your neighbor's property. When a man has <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> these to the best of his ability, and, instead of the bright joys of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which he desired and hoped for, finds in the darkness of the manifold trials of this world that he is bound to painful endurance, or has embraced Leah instead of Rachel, if there is perseverance in his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, he bears with the one in order to attain the other; and as if it were said to him, Serve seven other years for Rachel, he hears seven new commands&mdash;to be poor in spirit, to be meek, to be a mourner, to hunger and thirst after righteousness, to be merciful, pure, and a peacemaker. <span class="stiki" id="note140865"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;5:3-9</a></span> A man would desire, if it were possible, to obtain at once the joys of lovely and perfect wisdom, without the endurance of toil in action and suffering; but this is impossible in mortal life. This seems to be meant, when it is said to Jacob: "It is not the custom in our country to marry the younger before the elder." <span class="stiki" id="note140866"><a href="../bible/gen029.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;29:26</a></span> The elder may very well mean the first in order of time. So, in the discipline of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the toil of doing the work of righteousness precedes the delight of understanding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>53. To this purpose it is written: "You have desired wisdom; keep the commandments, and the Lord shall give it you." <span class="stiki" id="note140867"><a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse33">Sirach&nbsp;1:33</a></span> The commandments are those concerning righteousness, and the righteousness is that which is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, surrounded with the uncertainty of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>; so that understanding is the reward of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> belief of what is not yet understood. The meaning I have given to these words, "You have desired wisdom; keep the commandments, and the Lord shall give it you," I find also in the passage, "Unless ye <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, you shall not understand;"  showing that as righteousness is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, understanding comes by wisdom. Accordingly, in the case of those who eagerly demand evident <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we must not condemn the desire, but regulate it, so that beginning with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it may proceed to the desired end through good works. The life of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is one of toil; the end desired is unclouded wisdom. Why should I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, says one, what is not clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>? Let me hear some word which will disclose the first principle of all things. This is the one great craving of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And the answer is, What you desire is excellent, and well worthy of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; but Leah is to be married first, and then Rachel. The proper effect of your eagerness is to lead you to submit to the right method, instead of rebelling against it; for without this method you cannot attain what you so eagerly long for. And when it is attained, the possession of the lovely form of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> will be in this world accompanied with the toils of righteousness. For however clear and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> our perception in this life may be of the unchangeable good, the mortal body is still a weight on the mind and the earthly tabernacle is a clog on the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in its manifold activity. The end then, is one, but many things must be gone through for the sake of it.</p>

<p>54. Thus Jacob has two free wives; for both are daughters of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or of whitening, that is, of Laban. One is loved, the other is borne. But she that is borne is the most and the soonest fruitful, that she may be loved, if not for herself, at least for her children. For the toil of the righteous is specially fruitful in those whom they beget for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, by preaching the gospel amid many trials and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>; and they call those their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and crown <span class="stiki" id="note140869"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse1">Philippians&nbsp;4:1</a></span> for whom they are in labors more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often, <span class="stiki" id="note140870"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse23">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:23</a></span> &mdash; for whom they have fightings without and fears within. <span class="stiki" id="note140871"><a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:5</a></span> Such births result most easily and plentifully from the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the preaching of Christ crucified, which speaks also of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as far as it can be easily understood, so as not to hurt the weak eyes of Leah. Rachel, again, with clear eye, is beside herself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note140872"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:13</a></span> and sees in the beginning the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and wishes to bring forth, but cannot; for who shall declare His generation? So the life devoted to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, in order to see with no feeble mental eye things invisible to flesh, but understood by the things that are made, and to discern the ineffable manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power and divinity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeks leisure from all occupation, and is therefore barren. In this habit of retirement, where the fire of meditation burns bright, there is a want of sympathy with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, and with the need men have of our help in their calamities. This life also burns with the desire for children (for it wishes to teach what it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, and not to go with the corruption of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> <span class="stiki" id="note140873"><a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse23">Wisdom&nbsp;6:23</a></span>), and sees its sister-life fully occupied with work and with bringing forth; and it grieves that men run after that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which cares for their wants and weaknesses, instead of that which has a divine imperishable lesson to impart. This is what is meant when it is said, "Rachel envied her sister." <span class="stiki" id="note140874"><a href="../bible/gen030.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;30:1</a></span> Moreover, as the pure intellectual perception of that which is not matter, and so is not the object of the bodliy sense, cannot be expressed in words which spring from the flesh, the doctrine of wisdom prefers to get some lodging for divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the mind by whatever material figures and illustrations occur, rather than to give up teaching these things; and thus Rachel preferred that her husband should have children by her handmaid, rather than that she should be without any children. Bilhah, the name of her handmaid, is said to mean old; and so, even when we speak of the spiritual and unchangeable nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ideas are suggested relating to the old life of the bodily senses.</p>

<p>55. Leah, too, got children by her handmaid, from the desire of having a numerous <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Zilpah, her handmaid, is, interpreted, an open mouth. So Leah's handmaid represents those who are spoken of in Scripture as engaging in the preaching of the gospel with open mouth, but not with open heart. Thus it is written of some: "This people <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> me with their lips, but their heart is far from me." <span class="stiki" id="note140875"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13</a></span> To such the apostle says: "Thou that preachest that a man should not steal, do you steal? Thou that sayest a man should not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, do you commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>?" <span class="stiki" id="note140876"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;2:21-22</a></span> But that even by this arrangement the free wife of Jacob, the type of labor or endurance, might obtain children to be heirs of the kingdom, the Lord says: "What they say, do; but do not after their works." <span class="stiki" id="note140877"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;23:3</a></span> And again, the apostolic life, when enduring imprisonment, says: "Whether Christ is preached in pretence or in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I therein do <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, yea, and will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140878"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse18">Philippians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> It is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the mother over her numerous <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, though born of her handmaid.</p>

<p>56. In one instance Leah owed her becoming a mother to Rachel, who, in return for some mandrakes, allowed her husband to give her night to her sister. Some, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, think that eating this fruit has the effect of making barren <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> productive, and that Rachel, from her desire for children, was thus bent on getting the fruit from her sister. But I should not agree to this, even had Rachel conceived at the time. As Leah then conceived, and, besides, had two other children before God opened Rachel's womb, there is no reason for supposing any such quality in the mandrake, without any experience to prove it. I will give my explanation; those better able than I may give a better. Though this fruit is not often met with, I had once, to my great satisfaction, on account of its connection with this passage of Scripture, an opportunity of seeing it. I examined the fruit as carefully as I could, not with the help of any recondite <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of roots or the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of plants, but only as to what I or any one might learn from the sight, and smell, and taste. I thought it a nice-looking fruit, and sweet-smelling, but insipid; and I confess it is hard to say why Rachel desired it so much, unless it was for its rarity and its sweet smell. Why the incident should be narrated in Scripture, in which the fancies of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> would not be mentioned as important unless it was intended that we should learn some important lesson from them, the only thing I can think of is the very simple idea that the fruit represents a good character; not the praise given a man by a few just and wise people, but popular report, which bestows greatness and renown on a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and which is not desirable for its own sake, but is essential to the success of good men in their endeavors to benefit their fellow-men. So the apostle says, that it is proper to have a good report of those that are without; <span class="stiki" id="note140879"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:7</a></span> for though they are not infallible, the lustre of their praise and the odor of their good opinion are a great help to the efforts of those who seek to benefit them. And this popular renown is not obtained by those that are highest in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, unless they expose themselves to the toils and hazards of an active life. Thus the son of Leah found the mandrakes when he went out into the field, that is, when walking honestly towards those that are without. The pursuit of wisdom, on the other hand, retired from the busy crowd, and lost in calm meditation, could never obtain a particle of this public approval, except through those who take the management of public business, not for the sake of being leaders, but in order to be useful. These men of action and business exert themselves for the public benefit, and by a popular use of their influence gain the approval of the people even for the quiet life of the student and inquirer after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and thus through Leah the mandrakes come into the hands of Rachel. Leah herself got them from her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> son, that is, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of her fertility, which represents all the useful result of a laborious life exposed to the common vicissitudes; a life which many avoid on account of its troublesome engagements, because, although they might be able to take the lead, they are bent on study, and devote all their powers to the quiet pursuit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with the beauty of Rachel.</p>

<p>57. But as it is right that this studious life should gain public approval by letting itself be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, while it cannot rightly gain this approval if it keeps its follower in retirement, instead of using his powers for the management of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, and so prevents his being generally useful; to this purpose Leah says to her sister, "Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband? And would you take away my son's mandrakes also?" <span class="stiki" id="note140880"><a href="../bible/gen030.htm#verse15">Genesis&nbsp;30:15</a></span> The husband represents all those who, though fit for active life, and able to govern the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in administering to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, from their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of learning and of the pursuit of wisdom, desire to relinquish all troublesome occupations, and to bury themselves in the classroom. Thus the words, "Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband? And would you take away my son's mandrakes also?" mean, "Is it a small matter that the life of study keeps in retirement men required for the toils of public life? And does it ask for popular renown as well?"</p>

<p>58. To get this renown <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, Rachel gives her husband to her sister for the night; that is, those who, by a talent for business, are fitted for government, must for the public benefit consent to bear the burden and suffer the hardships of public life; lest the pursuit of wisdom, to which their leisure is devoted, should be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spoken of, and should not gain from the multitude the good opinion, represented by the fruit, which is necessary for the encouragement of their pupils. But the life of business must be forced upon them. This is clearly shown by Leah's meeting Jacob when coming from the field, and laying hold of him, saying, "You shall come in to me; for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." <span class="stiki" id="note140881"><a href="../bible/gen030.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;30:16</a></span> As if she said, Do you wish the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to be well thought of? Do not shirk the toil of business. The same thing happens constantly in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. What we read is explained by what we meet with in our own experience. Do we not everywhere see men coming from secular employments, to seek leisure for the study and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, their beloved Rachel, and intercepted mid-way by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, which require them to be set to work, as if Leah said to them, You must come in to me? When such men minister in sincerity the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so as in the night of this world to beget sons in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, popular approval is gained also for that life, in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for which they were led to abandon worldly pursuits, and from the adoption of which they were called away to undertake the benevolent task of government. In all their labors they aim chiefly at this, that their chosen way of life may have greater and wider renown, as having supplied the people with such leaders; as Jacob consents to go with Leah, that Rachel may obtain the sweet-smelling and good-looking fruit. Rachel, too, in course of time, by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, brings forth a child herself, but not till after some time; for it seldom happens that there is a sound, though only partial, apprehension, without fleshly ideas, of such sacred lessons of wisdom as this: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God." <span class="stiki" id="note140882"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> </p>

<p>59. This must suffice as a reply to the false accusations brought by Faustus against the three fathers, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob, from whom the God whom the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> worship was pleased to take His name. This is not the place to discourse on the merits and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of these three men, or on the dignity of their prophetic character, which is beyond the comprehension of carnal minds. It is enough in this treatise to defend them against the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> attacks of malevolence and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, in case those who read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> in a carping and hostile spirit should fancy that they have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> anything against the sacredness and the profitableness of these books, by their attempts to blacken the character of men who are there mentioned so honorably.</p>

<p>60. It should be added that <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, the brother, that is the blood relation, of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, is not to be ranked as equal to those of whom God says, "I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, of Isaac, and of Jacob;" nor does he belong to those testified to in Scripture as having continued righteous to the end, although in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> he lived a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life, and showed a praiseworthy hospitality, so that he was rescued from the fire, and a land was given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to his seed to dwell in, for the sake of his uncle <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. On these accounts he is commended in Scripture&mdash; not for intemperance or incest. But when we find bad and good actions recorded of the same person, we must take warning from the one, and example from the other. As, then, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, of whom we are told that he was righteous previous to this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, instead of bringing a stain on the character of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Scripture, rather calls on us to approve and admire the record in its resemblance to a faithful mirror, which reflects not only the beauties and perfections, but also the faults and deformities, of those who approach it; still more, in the case of Judah, who lay with his daughter-in-law, we may see how groundless are the reproaches cast on the narrative. The sacred record has an authority which raises it far above not merely the cavils of a handful of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, but the determined enmity of the whole Gentile world; for, in confirmation of its claims, we see that already it has brought nearly all people from their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> to the worship of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. It has conquered the world, not by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and warfare, but by the resistless force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Where, then, is Judah praised in Scripture? Where is anything good said of him, except that in the blessing pronounced by his father he is distinguished above the rest, because of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> that Christ would come in the flesh from his tribe? <span class="stiki" id="note140883"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;49:8-12</a></span> </p>

<p>61. Judah, as Faustus says, committed fornication; and besides that, we can accuse him of selling his brother into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Is it any disparagement to light, that in revealing all things it discloses what is unsightly? So neither is the character of Scripture affected by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> of which we are informed by the record itself. Undoubtedly, by the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law, which requires the preservation of natural order, and forbids the transgression of it, conjugal intercourse should take place only for the procreation of children, and after the celebration of marriage, so as to maintain the bond of peace. Therefore, the prostitution of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, merely for the gratification of sinful passion, is condemned by the divine and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law. To purchase the degradation of another, disgraces the purchaser; so that, though the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would have been greater if Judah had knowingly lain with his daughter-in-law (for if, as the Lord says, man and wife are no more two, but one flesh, <span class="stiki" id="note140884"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;19:6</a></span> a daughter-in-law is the same as a daughter); still, it is plain that, as regards his own intention, he was disgraced by his intercourse with an harlot. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, on the other hand, who deceived her father-in-law, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not from wantonness, or because she loved the gains of iniquity, but from her desire to have children of this particular <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. So, being disappointed in two of the brothers, and not obtaining the third, she succeeded by craft in getting a child by their father; and the reward which she got was kept, not as an ornament, but as a pledge. It would certainly have been better to have remained childless than to become a mother without marriage. Still, her desire to have her father-in-law as the father of her children was very different from having a criminal affection for him. And when, by his order, she was brought out to be killed, on her producing the staff and necklace and ring, saying that the father of the child was the man who had given her those pledges, Judah acknowledged them, and said, "She has been more righteous than I"&mdash; not praising her, but condemning himself. He blamed her desire to have children less than his own unlawful passion, which had led him to one whom he thought to be an harlot. In a similar sense, it is said of some that they justified <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note140885"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse52">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:52</a></span> that is, their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was so great, that <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> seemed righteous in comparison. And even allowing that this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is not spoken of as comparatively less guilty, but is actually praised by her father-in-law, while, on account of her not observing the established <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of marriage, she is a criminal in the eye of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law of right, which forbids the transgression of natural order, both as regards the body, and first and chiefly as regards the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, what wonder though one sinner should praise another?</p>

<p>62. The mistake of Faustus and of Manich&aelig;ism generally, is in supposing that these objections prove anything against us, as if our reverence for Scripture, and our profession of regard for its authority, bound us to approve of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> actions mentioned in it; whereas the greater our homage for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, the more decided must be our condemnation of what the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Scripture itself teaches us to condemn. In Scripture, all fornication and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> are condemned by the divine law; accordingly, when actions of this kind are narrated, without being expressly condemned, it is intended not that we should praise them, but that we should pass judgment on them ourselves. Every one execrates the cruelty of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, when, in his uneasiness on hearing of the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he commanded the slaughter of so many infants. <span class="stiki" id="note140886"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;2:16</a></span> But this is merely narrated without being condemned. Or if <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> absurdity is bold enough to deny the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this narrative, since they do not admit the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was what troubled <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, let them read the account of the blind fury of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, which is related without any expression of reproach, although the feeling of abhorrence is the same in all.</p>

<p>63. But, it is said, Judah, who lay with his daughter-in-law, is reckoned as one of the twelve patriarchs. And was not Judas, who betrayed the Lord, reckoned among the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? And was not this one of them, who was a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, sent along with them to preach the gospel? <span class="stiki" id="note140887"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse70">John&nbsp;6:70-71</a></span> In reply to this, it will be said that after his crime Judas hanged himself, and was removed from the number of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; while Judah, after his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> conduct, was not only blessed along with his brethren, but got special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and approval from his father, who is so highly spoken of in Scripture. But the main lesson to be learned from this is, that this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> refers not to Judah, but to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was foretold as to come in the flesh from his tribe; and the very reason for the mention of this crime of Judah is to be found in the desirableness of teaching us to look for another meaning in the words of his father, which are seen not to be applicable to him in his misconduct, from the praise which they express.</p>

<p>64. Doubtless, the intention of Faustus' <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> is to damage this very assertion, that Christ was born of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>. Especially, as in the genealogy given by Matthew we find the name of Zara, whom this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> Tamar bore to Judah. Had Faustus wished to reproach Jacob's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> merely, and not Christ's birth, he might have taken the case of Reuben the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, who committed the unnatural crime of defiling his father's bed, of which fornication the apostle says, that it was not so much as named among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140888"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:1</a></span> Jacob also mentions this in his blessing, charging his son with the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> deed. Faustus might have brought up this, as Reuben seems to have been guilty of deliberate incest, and there was no harlot's disguise in this case, were it not that Tamar's conduct in desiring nothing but to have children is more odious to Faustus than if she had acted from criminal passion, and did he not wish to discredit the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, by bringing reproach on Christ's progenitors. Faustus unhappily is not aware that the most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and truthful Saviour is a teacher, not only in His words, but also in His birth. In His fleshly origin there is this lesson for those who should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him from all nations, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their fathers need be no hindrance to them. Besides, the Bridegroom, who was to call good and bad to His marriage, <span class="stiki" id="note140889"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;22:10</a></span> was pleased to assimilate Himself to His guests, in being born of good and bad. He thus confirms as typical of Himself the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, in which it was commanded that the lamb to be eaten should be taken from the sheep or from the goats&mdash; that is, from the righteous or the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140890"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse3">Exodus&nbsp;12:3-5</a></span> Preserving throughout the indication of divinity and humanity, as man He consented to have both bad and good as His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, while as God He chose the miraculous birth from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>.</p>

<p>65. The impiety, therefore, of Faustus' attacks on Scripture can injure no one but himself; for what he thus assails is now deservedly the object of universal reverence. As has been said already, the sacred record, like a faithful mirror, has no flattery in its portraits, and either itself passes sentence upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions as worthy of approval or disapproval, or leaves the reader to do so. And not only does it distinguish men as blameworthy or praiseworthy, but it also takes notice of cases where the blameworthy deserve praise, and the praiseworthy blame. Thus, although Saul was blameworthy, it was not the less praiseworthy in him to examine so carefully who had eaten food during the curse, and to pronounce the stern sentence in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140891"><a href="../bible/1sa014.htm">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;xiv</a></span> So, too, he was right in banishing those that had familiar spirits and wizards out of the land. <span class="stiki" id="note140892"><a href="../bible/1sa028.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;28:3</a></span> And although David was praiseworthy, we are not called on to approve or imitate his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rebukes by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. And so <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> was not wrong in pronouncing the Lord innocent, in spite of the accusations of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note140893"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;19:4,&nbsp;6</a></span> nor was it praiseworthy in Peter to deny the Lord thrice; nor, again, was he praiseworthy on that occasion when Christ called him <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> because, not understanding the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he wished to withhold Christ from his passion, that is, from our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Here Peter, immediately after being called blessed, is called <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>.  Which character most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> belonged to him, we may see from his apostleship, and from his crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<p>66. In the case of David also, we read of both good and bad actions. But where David's strength lay, and what was the secret of his success, is sufficiently plain, not to the blind malevolence with which Faustus assails <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writings and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, but to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> discernment, which bows to the divine authority, and at the same time judges correctly of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct. The <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> will find, if they read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, that God rebukes David more than Faustus does. <span class="stiki" id="note140895"><a href="../bible/2sa012.htm">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;12</a></span> But they will read also of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of his penitence, of his surpassing gentleness to his merciless and bloodthirsty enemy, whom David, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> as he was brave, dismissed unhurt when now and again he fell into his hands.  They will read of his memorable humility under divine chastisement, when the kingly neck was so bowed under the Master's yoke, that he bore with perfect patience bitter taunts from his enemy, though he was armed, and had armed men with him. And when his companion was enraged at such things being said to the king, and was on the point of requiting the insult on the head of the scoffer, he mildly restrained him, appealing to the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in support of his own royal order, and saying that this bad happened to him as a punishment from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who had sent the man to curse him. <span class="stiki" id="note140897"><a href="../bible/2sa016.htm">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;xvi</a></span> They will read how, with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of a shepherd for the flock entrusted to him, he was willing to die for them, when, after he had numbered the people, God saw good to punish his sinful <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> by lessening the number he boasted of. In this destruction, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with whom there is no iniquity, in His secret judgment, both took away the lives of those whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be unworthy of life, and by this diminution cured the vainglory which had prided itself on the number of the people. They will read of that scrupulous <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in his regard for the emblem of Christ in the sacred anointing, which made David's heart smite him with regret for having secretly cut off a small piece of Saul's garment, that he might prove to him that he had no wish to kill him, when he might have done it. They will read of his judicious behavior as regards his children, and also of his tenderness toward them&mdash; how, when one was sick, he entreated the Lord for him with many tears and with much self-abasement, but when he died, an innocent child, he did not mourn for him; and again, how, when his youthful son was carried away with unnatural hostility to an <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> violation of his father's bed, and in a parricidal <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, he wished him to live, and wept for him when he was killed; for he thought of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> doom of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> guilty of such crimes, and desired that he should live to escape this doom by being brought to submission and repentance. These, and many other praiseworthy and exemplary things, may be seen in this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man by a candid examination of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> narrative, especially if in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and unfeigned <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we regard the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the secrets of David's heart, and who, in His infallible inspection, so approves of David as to commend him as a pattern to his sons.</p>

<p>67. It must have been on account of this inspection of the depths of David's heart by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> that, when on being reproved by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, he said, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, he was considered worthy to be told, immediately after this brief confession, that he was pardoned&mdash; that is, that he was admitted to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For he did not escape the correction of the fatherly rod, of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke in His threatening, that, while by his confession he obtained <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> exemption, he might be tried by temporal chastisement. And it is a remarkable evidence of the strength of David's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and of his meek and submissive spirit, that, when he had been told by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> that God had forgiven him, although the threatened consequences were still permitted to follow, he did not accuse the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of having deluded him, or murmur against God as having mocked him with a declaration of forgiveness. This deeply <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was lifted up unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that had not the Lord mercifully accepted his confession and repentance, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> would have deserved <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment. So when, instead of this, he was made to smart under temporal correction, he saw that, while the pardon remained good, wholesome discipline was also provided. Saul, too, when he was reproved by Samuel, said, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140898"><a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;15:24</a></span> Why, then, was he not considered fit to be told, as David was, that the Lord had pardoned his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Is there acceptance of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with God? Far from it. While to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ear the words were the same, the divine eye saw a difference in the heart. The lesson for us to learn from these things is, that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is within us, <span class="stiki" id="note140899"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;17:28</a></span> and that we must worship God from our inmost feelings, that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth may speak, instead of honoring Him with our lips, like the people of old, while our hearts are far from Him. We may learn also to judge of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whose hearts we cannot see, only as God judges, who sees what we cannot, and who cannot be biased or misled. Having, on the high authority of sacred Scripture, the plainest announcement of God's opinion of David, we may regard as absurd or deplorable the rashness of men who hold a different opinion. The authority of Scripture, as regards the character of these men of ancient times, is supported by the evidence from the prophecies which they contain, and which are now receiving their fulfillment.</p>

<p>68. We see the same thing in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, where the devils confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the words used by Peter, but with a very different heart. So, though the words were the same, Peter is praised for his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, while the impiety of the devils is checked. For Christ, not by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sense, but by divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, could inspect and infallibly discriminate the sources from which the words came. Besides, there are multitudes who confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without meriting the same approval as Peter&mdash; not only of those who shall say in that day, "Lord, Lord," and shall receive the sentence, "Depart from me," but also of those who shall be placed on the right hand. They may probably never have denied Christ even once; they may never have opposed His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; they may never have forced the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to do as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note140900"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> and yet they shall not be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> equally with Peter, who, though he did all these things, will sit on one of the twelve thrones, and judge not only the twelve tribes, but the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. So, again, many who have never desired another man's wife, or procured the death of the husband, as David did, will never reach the place which David nevertheless held in the divine favor. There is a vast difference between what is in itself so undesirable that it must be utterly rejected, and the rich and plenteous harvest which may afterwards appear. For farmers are best pleased with the fields from which, after weeding them, it may be, of great thistles, they receive an hundred-fold; not with fields which have never had any thistles, and hardly bear thirty-fold.</p>

<p>69. So <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, too, who was so faithful a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all his house; the minister of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, just, and good law; of whose character the apostle speaks in the words here quoted; <span class="stiki" id="note140901"><a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse5">Hebrews&nbsp;3:5</a></span> the minister also of the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> which, though not conferring <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, promised the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, as the Saviour Himself shows, when He says, "If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me, for he wrote of me,"&mdash; from which passage we have already sufficiently answered the presumptuous cavils of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>&mdash;this <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the servant of the living, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that made heaven and earth, not of a foreign substance, but of nothing&mdash; not from the pressure of necessity, but from plenitude of goodness&mdash; not by the suffering of His members, but by the power of His word&mdash;this <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who humbly put from him this high ministry, but obediently accepted it, and faithfully kept it, and diligently fulfilled it; who ruled the people with vigilance, reproved them with vehemence, loved them with fervor, and bore with them in patience, standing for his subjects before God to receive His counsel, and to appease His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>&mdash;this great and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man is not to be judged of from Faustus' malicious representations, but from what is said by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose word is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> expression of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion of this man, whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> because He made him. For the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of men are also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though He is not their author; but He takes notice of them as a judge in those who refuse to own them, and pardons them as a father in those who make confession. His servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as thus described, we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and admire  and to the best of our power imitate, coming indeed far short of his merits, though we have killed no <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, nor plundered any one, nor carried on any <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; which actions of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> were in one case prompted by the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the future champion of his people, and in the other cases commanded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>70. It might be shown that, though <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> slew the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, without being commanded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the action was divinely permitted, as, from the prophetic character of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, it prefigured something in the future. Now however, I do not use this argument, but view the action as having no <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> meaning. In the light, then, of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law, it was wrong for one who had no legal authority to kill the man, even though he was a bad character, besides being the aggressor. But in minds where great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is to come, there is often an early crop of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, in which we may still discern a disposition for some particular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which will come when the mind is duly cultivated. For as farmers, when they see land bringing forth huge crops, though of weeds, pronounce it good for grain; or when they see wild creepers, which have to be rooted out, still consider the land good for useful vines; and when they see a hill covered with wild olives, conclude that with culture it will produce good fruit: so the disposition of mind which led <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to take the law into his own hands, to prevent the wrong done to his brother, living among strangers, by a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> citizen of the country from being unrequited, was not unfit for the production of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but from want of culture gave signs of its productiveness in an unjustifiable manner. He who afterwards, by His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, called <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> on Mount Sinai, with the divine commission to liberate the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and who trained him to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> by the miraculous appearance in the bush burning but not consumed, and by instructing him in his ministry, was the same who, by the call addressed from heaven to Saul when <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, humbled him, raised him up, and animated him; or in figurative words, by this stroke He cut off the branch, grafted it, and made it fruitful. For the fierce energy of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when in his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for hereditary traditions he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, thinking that he was doing God service, was like a crop of weeds showing great signs of productiveness. It was the same in Peter, when he took his sword out of its sheath to defend the Lord, and cut off the right ear of an assailant, when the Lord rebuked him with something like a threat, saying, "Put up your sword into its sheath; for he that takes the sword shall perish by the sword." <span class="stiki" id="note140902"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse51">Matthew&nbsp;26:51-52</a></span> To take the sword is to use weapons against a man's life, without the sanction of the constituted authority. The Lord, indeed, had told His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to carry a sword; but He did not tell them to use it. But that after this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> Peter should become a pastor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was no more improper than that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, after smiting the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, should become the leader of the congregation. In both cases the trespass originated not in inveterate cruelty, but in a hasty <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> which admitted of correction. In both cases there was resentment against injury, accompanied in one case by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for a brother, and in the other by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, though still carnal, of the Lord. Here was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be subdued or rooted out; but the heart with such capacities needed only, like good soil, to be cultivated to make it fruitful in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>71. Then, as for Faustus' objection to the spoiling of the Egyptians, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what he says. In this <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> not only did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but it would have been <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not to do it. It was by the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  who, from His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> both of the actions and of the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, can decide on what every one should be made to suffer, and through whose agency. The people at that time were still carnal, and engrossed with earthly affections; while the Egyptians were in open rebellion against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for they used the gold, God's creature, in the service of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, to the dishonor of the Creator, and they had grievously oppressed strangers by making them work without pay. Thus the Egyptians deserved the punishment, and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> were suitably employed in inflicting it. Perhaps, indeed, it was not so much a command as a permission to the Hebrews to act in the matter according to their own inclinations; and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in sending the message by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, only wished that they should thus be informed of His permission. There may also have been <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> reasons for what God said to the people on this matter. At any rate, God's commands are to be submissively received, not to be argued against. The apostle says, "Who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counsellor?" <span class="stiki" id="note140904"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse34">Romans&nbsp;11:34</a></span> Whether, then, the reason was what I have said, or whether in the secret appointment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there was some unknown reason for His telling the people by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to borrow things from the Egyptians, and to take them away with them, this remains certain, that this was said for some good reason, and that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> could not lawfully have done otherwise than God told him, leaving to God the reason of the command, while the servant's duty is to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>.</p>

<p>72. But, says Faustus, it cannot be admitted that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is also good, ever gave such a command. I answer, such a command can be rightly given by no other than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the suitable command in every case, and who alone is incapable of inflicting unmerited suffering on any one. This <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and spurious goodness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart may as well deny what Christ says, and object to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> being made to suffer by the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He shall say to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, "Gather first the tares into bundles to burn them." The servants, however, were stopped when they wished to do this prematurely: "Lest by chance, when you would gather the tares, you root up the wheat also with them." <span class="stiki" id="note140905"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;13:29-30</a></span> Thus the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and good God alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> when, to whom, and by whom to order anything, or to permit anything. In the same way, this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> goodness, or folly rather, might object to the Lord's permitting the devils to enter the swine, which they asked to be allowed to do with a mischievous intent, <span class="stiki" id="note140906"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;8:31-32</a></span> especially as the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that not only pigs, but the vilest insects, have <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. But setting aside these absurd notions, this is undeniable, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, and therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, permitted the destruction of swine belonging to strangers, implying loss of life and of a great amount of property, at the request of devils. No one can be so insane as to suppose that Christ could not have driven the devils out of the men without gratifying their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> by the destruction of the swine. If, then, the Creator and Governor of all natures, in His superintendence, which, though <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a>, is ever just, indulged the violent and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> inclination of those lost spirits already doomed to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, why should not the Egyptians, who were unrighteous oppressors, be spoiled by the Hebrews, a free people, who would claim payment for their enforced and painful toil, especially as the earthly possessions which they thus lost were used by the Egyptians in their impious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, to the dishonor of the Creator? Still, if <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had originated this order, or if the people had done it spontaneously, undoubtedly it would have been sinful; and perhaps the people did <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not in doing what God commanded or permitted, but in some desire of their own for what they took. The permission given to this action by divine authority was in accordance with the just and good counsel of Him who uses punishments both to restrain the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and to educate His own people; who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also how to give more advanced precepts to those able to bear them, while He begins on a lower scale in the treatment of the feeble. As for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, he can be blamed neither for <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> the property, nor for disputing, in any instance, the divine authority.</p>

<p>73. According to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law, which requires the preservation of natural order, and forbids the transgression of it, some actions have an indifferent character, so that men are blamed for presumption if they do them without being called upon, while they are deservedly praised for doing them when required. The act, the agent, and the authority for the action are all of great importance in the order of nature. For <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> his son of his own accord is shocking <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. His doing so at the command of God proves him faithful and submissive. This is so loudly proclaimed by the very voice of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that Faustus, eagerly rummaging for some fault, and reduced at last to <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> charges, has not the boldness to attack this action. It is scarcely possible that he can have forgotten a deed so famous, that it recurs to the mind of itself without any study or reflection, and is in fact repeated by so many tongues, and portrayed in so many places, that no one can pretend to shut his eyes or his ears to it. If, therefore, while <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> killing his son of his own accord would have been unnatural, his doing it at the command of God shows not only guiltless but praiseworthy compliance, why does Faustus blame <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> for spoiling the Egyptians? Your feeling of disapproval for the mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action should be restrained by a regard for the divine sanction. Will you venture to blame God Himself for desiring such actions? Then "Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, for you understand not the things which be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but those which be of men." Would that this rebuke might accomplish in you what it did in Peter, and that you might hereafter preach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which you now, judging by feeble sense, find fault with! As Peter became a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> messenger to announce to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> what he objected to at first, when the Lord spoke of it as His intention.</p>

<p>74. Now, if this explanation suffices to satisfy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> obstinacy and perverse misinterpretation of right actions of the vast difference between the indulgence of passion and presumption on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what to permit or to order, and also the time and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and the due action or suffering in each case, the account of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> will not excite surprise or abhorrence, for in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> carried on by divine command, he showed not ferocity but <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>; and God in giving the command, acted not in cruelty, but in righteous retribution, giving to all what they deserved, and warning those who needed warning. What is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>? Is it the death of some who will soon die in any case, that others may live in peaceful subjection? This is mere cowardly dislike, not any religious feeling. The real <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> are <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, revengeful cruelty, fierce and implacable enmity, wild resistance, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of power, and such like; and it is generally to punish these things, when force is required to inflict the punishment, that, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to God or some lawful authority, good men undertake <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, when they find themselves in such a position as regards the conduct of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, that right conduct requires them to act, or to make others act in this way. Otherwise John, when the soldiers who came to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> asked, What shall we do? Would have replied, Throw away your arms; give up the service; never strike, or wound, or disable any one. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that such actions in battle were not murderous but authorized by law, and that the soldiers did not thus avenge themselves, but defend the public safety, he replied, "Do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to no man, accuse no man <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, and be content with your wages." <span class="stiki" id="note140907"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;3:14</a></span> But as the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of speaking <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of John, let them hear the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself ordering this money to be given to C&aelig;sar, which John tells the soldiers to be content with. "Give," He says, "to C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's." <span class="stiki" id="note140908"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;22:21</a></span> For tribute-money is given on purpose to pay the soldiers for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Again, in the case of the centurion who said, "I am a man under authority, and have soldiers under me: and I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it," Christ gave due praise to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note140909"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;8:9-10</a></span> He did not tell him to leave the service. But there is no need here to enter on the long discussion of just and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> ways.</p>

<p>75. A great deal depends on the causes for which men undertake <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and on the authority they have for doing so; for the natural order which seeks the peace of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, ordains that the monarch should have the power of undertaking <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> if he thinks it advisable, and that the soldiers should perform their military duties in behalf of the peace and safety of the community. When <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is undertaken in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who would rebuke, or <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, or crush the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it must be allowed to be a righteous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; for even the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> which arise from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> passion cannot harm the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> well-being of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor even hurt His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; for in the trial of their patience, and the chastening of their spirit, and in bearing fatherly correction, they are rather benefited than injured. No one can have any power against them but what is given him from above. For there is no power but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note140910"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;13:1</a></span> who either orders or permits. Since, therefore, a righteous man, serving it may be under an ungodly king, may do the duty belonging to his position in the State in fighting by the order of his sovereign&mdash;for in some cases it is plainly the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that he should fight, and in others, where this is not so plain, it may be an unrighteous command on the part of the king, while the soldier is innocent, because his position makes <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> a duty,&mdash; how much more must the man be blameless who carries on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whom every one who serves Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that He can never require what is wrong?</p>

<p>76. If it is supposed that God could not enjoin warfare, because in after times it was said by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, "I say unto you, That ye resist not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: but if any one strike you on the right cheek, turn to him the left also," <span class="stiki" id="note140911"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;5:39</a></span> the answer is, that what is here required is not a bodily action, but an inward disposition. The sacred seat of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the heart, and such were the hearts of our fathers, the righteous men of old. But order required such a regulation of events, and such a distinction of times, as to show first of all that even earthly blessings (for so temporal kingdoms and victory over enemies are considered to be, and these are the things which the community of the ungodly all over the world are continually begging from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and devils) are entirely under the control and at the disposal of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Thus, under the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the secret of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, which was to be disclosed in due time, was veiled, and so far obscured, in the disguise of earthly promises. But when the fullness of time came for the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which was hidden under the types of the Old, clear testimony was to be borne to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that there is another life for which this life ought to be disregarded, and another kingdom for which the opposition of all earthly kingdoms should be patiently borne. Thus the name <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, which means witnesses, was given to those who, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, bore this testimony, by their confessions, their sufferings, and their death. The number of such witnesses is so great, that if it pleased Christ&mdash; who called Saul by a voice from heaven, and having changed him from a wolf to a sheep, sent him into the midst of wolves&mdash; to unite them all in one army, and to give them success in battle, as He gave to the Hebrews, what nation could withstand them? What kingdom would remain unsubdued? But as the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is, that we must serve God not for temporal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in this life, but for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> felicity hereafter, this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was most strikingly confirmed by the patient endurance of what is commonly called adversity for the sake of that felicity. So in fullness of time the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law, made of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh sends His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as sheep into the midst of wolves, and bids them not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> those that can kill the body, but cannot kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and promises that even the body will be entirely restored, so that not a hair shall be lost.  Peter's sword He orders back into its sheath, restoring as it was before the ear of His enemy that had been cut off. He says that He could obtain legions of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to destroy His enemies, but that He must drink the cup which His Father's will had given Him.  He sets the example of drinking this cup, then hands it to His followers, manifesting thus, both in word and deed, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of patience. Therefore God raised Him from the dead, and has given Him a name which is above every name; that in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> every knee should bow, of things in heaven and of things in earth, and of things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Lord, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. <span class="stiki" id="note140914"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse9">Philippians&nbsp;2:9-11</a></span> The patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, then, have a kingdom in this world, to show that these kingdoms, too, are given and taken away by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> had no kingdom here, to show the superior desirableness of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, however, could even in those times die for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as the Lord Himself says, "From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharia; <span class="stiki" id="note140915"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;23:35</a></span> and in these days, since the commencement of the fulfillment of what is prophesied in the psalm of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, under the figure of Solomon, which means the peacemaker, as Christ is our peace, <span class="stiki" id="note140916"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> "All kings of the earth shall bow to Him, all nations shall serve Him,"  we have seen <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors, who have put all their confidence in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, gaining splendid victories over ungodly enemies, whose hope was in the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and devil-worship. There are public and undeniable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the fact, that on one side the prognostications of devils were found to be fallacious, and on the other, the predictions of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were a means of support; and we have now writings in which those facts are recorded.</p>

<p>77. If our foolish opponents are surprised at the difference between the precepts given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, at a time when the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the New was still undisclosed, and those given to the preachers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, now that the obscurity of the Old is removed, they will find Christ Himself saying one thing at one time, and another at another. "When I sent you," He says, "without scrip, or purse, or shoes, did ye lack anything? And they said, Nothing. Then says He to them, But now, he that has a scrip, let him take it, and also a purse; and he that has not a sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one." If the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> found passages in the Old and New Testaments differing in this way, they would proclaim it as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the Testaments are opposed to each other. But here the difference is in the utterances of one and the same person. At one time He says, "I sent you without scrip, or purse, or shoes, and you lacked nothing;" at another, "Now let him that has a scrip take it, and also a purse; and he that has a tunic, let him sell it and buy a sword." Does not this show how, without any inconsistency, precepts and counsels and permissions may be changed, as different times require different arrangements? If it is said that there was a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> meaning in the command to take a scrip and purse, and to buy a sword, why may there not be a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> meaning in the fact, that one and the same God commanded the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in old times to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and forbade the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? And we find in the passage that we have quoted from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that the words spoken by the Lord were carried into effect by His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. For, besides going at first without scrip or purse, and yet lacking nothing, as from the Lord's question and their answer it is plain they did, now that He speaks of buying a sword, they say, "Lo, here are two swords;" and He replied, "It is enough." Hence we find Peter with a weapon when he cut off the assailant's ear, on which occasion his spontaneous boldness was checked, because, although he had been told to take a sword, he had not been told to use it.  Doubtless, it was <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> that the Lord should require them to carry weapons, and forbid the use of them. But it was His part to give the suitable precepts, and it was their part to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> without reserve.</p>

<p>78. It is therefore mere groundless <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> to charge <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> with making <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, for there would have been less harm in making <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of his own accord, than in not doing it when God commanded him. And to dare to find fault with God Himself for giving such a command, or not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it possible that a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and good God did so, shows, to say the least, an inability to consider that in the view of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, which pervades all things from the highest to the lowest, time can neither add anything nor take away; but all things go, or come, or remain according to the order of nature or desert in each separate case, while in men a right will is in union with the divine law, and ungoverned passion is restrained by the order of divine law; so that a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man wills only what is commanded, and a bad man can do only what he is permitted, at the same time that he is punished for what he wills to do <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>. Thus, in all the things which appear shocking and terrible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feebleness, the real <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; the rest is only the result of natural properties or of moral demerit. This <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is seen in every case where a man loves for their own sake things which are desirable only as means to an end, and seeks for the sake of something else things which ought to be loved for themselves. For thus, as far as he can, he disturbs in himself the natural order which the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law requires us to observe. Again, a man is just when he seeks to use things only for the end for which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> appointed them, and to enjoy God as the end of all, while he enjoys himself and his friend in God and for God. For to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in a friend the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the friend for God. Now both <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, to be acts at all, must be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>; otherwise, there can be no just rewards or punishments; which no man in his senses will assert. The <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and infirmity which prevent a man from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> his duty, or from doing all he wishes to do, belong to God's secret penal arrangement, and to His unfathomable judgments, for with Him there is no iniquity. Thus we are informed by the sure word of God of Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and Scripture <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> declares that in him all die, and that by him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.  And our experience gives abundant evidence, that in punishment for this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> our body is corrupted, and weighs down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the clay tabernacle clogs the mind in its manifold activity; <span class="stiki" id="note140920"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we can be freed from this punishment only by gracious interposition. So the apostle cries out in distress, "O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord." <span class="stiki" id="note140921"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24-25</a></span> So much we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but the reasons for the distribution of divine judgment and mercy, why one is in this condition, and another in that, though just, are unknown. Still, we are sure that all these things are due either to the mercy or the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the measures and numbers and weights by which the Creator of all natural productions arranges all things are concealed from our view. For God is not the author, but He is the controller of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so that sinful actions, which are sinful because they are against nature, are judged and controlled, and assigned to their proper place and condition, in order that they may not bring discord and disgrace on universal nature. This being the case, and as the judgments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the movements of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will contain the hidden reason why the same prosperous circumstances which some make a right use of are the ruin of others, and the same afflictions under which some give way are profitable to others, and since the whole mortal life of man upon earth is a trial, <span class="stiki" id="note140922"><a href="../bible/job007.htm#verse4">Job&nbsp;7:4</a></span> who can tell whether it may be good or bad in any particular case&mdash; in time of peace, to reign or to serve, or to be at ease or to die&mdash; or in time of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, to command or to fight, or to conquer or to be killed? At the same time, it remains <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that whatever is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is so by the divine blessing, and whatever is bad is so by the divine judgment.</p>

<p>79. Let no one, then, be so daring as to make rash charges against men, not to say against God. If the service of the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, who were also heralds of the New, consisted in putting sinners to death, and that of the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, who are also interpreters of the Old, in being <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by sinners, the service in both cases is rendered to one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, varying the lesson to suit the times, teaches both that temporal blessings are to be sought from Him, and that they are to be forsaken for Him, and that temporal distress is both sent by Him and should be endured for Him. There was, therefore, no cruelty in the command, or in the action of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when, in his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> jealousy for his people, whom he wished to be subject to the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on learning that they had fallen away to the worship of an idol made by their own hands, he impressed their minds at the time with a wholesome <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and gave them a warning for the future, by using the sword in the punishment of a few, whose <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, against whom they had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, appointed in the depth of His secret judgment to be immediately inflicted. That <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> acted as he did, not in cruelty, but in great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, may be seen from the words in which he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people: "If You will forgive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, forgive it; and if not, blot me out of Your book." <span class="stiki" id="note140923"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse32">Exodus&nbsp;32:32</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> inquirer who compares the slaughter with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> will find in this the clearest evidence of the awful nature of the injury done to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by prostitution to the images of devils, since such <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is roused to such <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. We see the same in the apostle, who, not in cruelty, but in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, delivered a man up to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140924"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> Others, too, he delivered up, that they might learn not to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140925"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:20</a></span> In the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> books of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> there is a collection of fables, published by some unknown authors under the name of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. The books would no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have been sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at the time of their publication, if <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and learned men then in life, and competent to determine the matter, had thought the contents to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. One of the stories is, that the Apostle Thomas was once at a marriage feast in a country where he was unknown, when one of the servants struck him, and that he immediately by his curse brought a terrible punishment on this man. For when he went out to the fountain to provide water for the guests, a lion fell on him and killed him, and the hand with which he had given a slight blow to the apostle was torn off, in fulfillment of the imprecation, and brought by a dog to the table at which the apostle was reclining. What could be more cruel than this? And yet, if I mistake not, the story goes on to say, that the apostle made up for the cruelty by obtaining for the man the blessing of pardon in the next world; so that, while the people of this strange country learned to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the apostle as being so dear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the man's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> welfare was secured in exchange for the loss of this mortal life. It matters not whether the story is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or false. At any rate, the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, who regard as genuine and authentic books which the canon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> rejects, must allow, as shown in the story, that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of patience, which the Lord enjoins when He says, "If any one smite you on the right cheek, turn to him your left also," may be in the inward disposition, though it is not exhibited in bodily action or in words. For when the apostle was struck, instead of turning his other side to the man, or telling him to repeat the blow, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to God to pardon his assailant in the next world, but not to leave the injury unpunished at the time. Inwardly he preserved a kindly feeling, while outwardly he wished the man to be punished as an example. As the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, rightly or wrongly, they may also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that such was the intention of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he cut down with the sword the makers and worshippers of the idol; for his own words show that he so entreated for pardon for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> as to ask to be blotted out of God's book if his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was not heard. There is no comparison between a stranger being struck with the hand, and the dishonor done to God by forsaking Him for an idol, when He had brought the people out of the bondage of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, had led them through the sea, and had covered with the waters the enemy pursuing them. Nor, as regards the punishment, is there any comparison between being killed with the sword and being torn in pieces by wild beasts. For judges in administering the law condemn to exposure to wild beasts worse criminals than are condemned to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the sword.</p>

<p>80. Another of Faustus' malicious and impious charges which has to be answered, is about the Lord's saying to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Hosea, "Take unto you a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms." <span class="stiki" id="note140926"><a href="../bible/hos001.htm#verse2">Hosea&nbsp;1:2</a></span> As regards this passage, the impure mind of our adversaries is so blinded that they do not understand the plain words of the Lord in His gospel, when He says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and harlots shall go into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> before you." <span class="stiki" id="note140927"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;21:31</a></span> There is nothing contrary to the mercifulness of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in a harlot leaving fornication, and becoming a chaste wife. Indeed, nothing could be more unbecoming in one professing to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> than not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> were pardoned when she changed for the better. So when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> took the harlot as his wife, it was both good for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to have her life amended, and the action symbolized a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of which we shall speak presently. But it is plain what offends the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> in this case; for their great anxiety is to prevent harlots from being with child. It would have pleased them better that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should continue a prostitute, so as not to bring their god into confinement, than that she should become the wife of one man, and have children.</p>

<p>81. As regards Solomon, it need only be said that the condemnation of his conduct in the faithful narrative of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture is much more serious than the childish vehemence of Faustus' attacks. The Scripture tells us with faithful accuracy both the good that Solomon had at first, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> actions by which he lost the good he began with; while Faustus, in his attacks, like a man closing his eyes, or with no eyes at all, seeks no guidance from the light, but is prompted only by violent animosity. To <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and discerning readers of the sacred Scriptures evidence of the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men who are said to have had several wives is found in this, that Solomon, who by his polygamy gratified his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, instead of seeking for offspring, is expressly noted as chargeable with being a lover of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. This, as we are informed by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which accepts no man's person, led him down into the abyss of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</p>

<p>82. Having now gone over all the cases in which Faustus finds fault with the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and having attended to the merit of each, either defending men of God against the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of carnal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or, where the men were at fault, showing the excellence and the majesty of Scripture, let us again take the cases in the order of Faustus' accusations, and see the meaning of the actions recorded, what they typify, and what they foretell. This we have already done in the case of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob, of whom God said that He was their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of universal nature were the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of none besides them; not honoring them with an unmeaning title, but because He, who could alone have a full and perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the sincere and remarkable charity of these men; and because these three patriarchs united formed a notable type of the future people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in not only having free children by free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as by Sarah, and Rebecca, and Leah, and Rachel, but also bond children, as of this same Rebecca was born <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, to whom it was said, "You shall serve your brother;" <span class="stiki" id="note140928"><a href="../bible/gen027.htm#verse40">Genesis&nbsp;27:40</a></span> and in having by bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> not only bond children, as by Hagar, but also free children, as by Bilhah and Zilphah. Thus also in the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, those spiritually free not only have children born into the enjoyment of liberty, like those to whom it is said, "Be followers of me, as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note140929"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> but they have also children born into guilty bondage, as Simon was born of Philip. <span class="stiki" id="note140930"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;8:13</a></span> Again, from carnal bondmen are born not only children of guilty bondage, who imitate them, but also children of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> liberty, to whom it is said, "What they say, do; but do not after their works." <span class="stiki" id="note140931"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;23:3</a></span> Whoever rightly observes the fulfillment of this type in the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, keeps the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, by continuing to the end in union with some, and in patient endurance of others. Of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, also, we have already spoken, and have shown what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> mentions as praiseworthy in him, and what as blameworthy and the meaning of the whole narrative.</p>

<p>83. We have next to consider the prophetic significance of the action of Judah in lying with his daughter-in-law. But, for the sake of those whose understanding is feeble, we shall begin with observing, that in sacred Scripture <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> actions are sometimes prophetic not of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but of good. <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> preserves throughout its essential goodness, so that, as in the example given above, from adulterous intercourse a man-child is born, a good work of God from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by the power of nature, and not due to the misconduct of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; so in the prophetic Scriptures, where both good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> actions are recorded, the narrative being itself prophetic, foretells something good even by the record of what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the credit being due not to the evil-doer, but to the writer. Judah, when, to gratify his sinful passion, he went in to Tamar, had no intention by his licentious conduct to typify anything connected with the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, any more than Judas, who betrayed the Lord, intended to produce any result connected with the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men. So then if from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deed</a> of Judas the Lord brought the good work of our redemption by His own passion, why should not His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, of whom He Himself says "He wrote of me," for the sake of instructing us make the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action of Judah significant of something good? Under the guidance and inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has compiled a narrative of actions so as to make a continuous <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the things he designed to foretell. In foretelling good, it is of no consequence whether the typical actions are good or bad. If it is written in red ink that the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> are black, or in black ink that the Gauls are white, this circumstance does not affect the information which the writing conveys. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, if it was a painting instead of a writing, the wrong color would be a fault; so when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are represented for example or for warning much depends on whether they are good or bad. But when actions are related or recorded as types, the merit or demerit of the agents is a matter of no importance, as long as there is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> typical relation between the action and the thing signified. So in the case of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> as regards his iniquitous and mischievous intention, and even as regards his words in the sense in which he used them, that a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, assuredly they were bad; and yet there was a good meaning in his words which he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of when he said, "It is expedient that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not." So it is written of Him, "This he spoke not of himself; but being the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, he prophesied that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> should die for the people." <span class="stiki" id="note140932"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse50">John&nbsp;11:50-51</a></span> In the same way the action of Judah was bad as regards his sinful passion, but it typified a great good he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of. Of himself he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> while it was not of himself that he typified good. These introductory remarks apply not only to Judah, but also to all the other cases where in the narrative of bad actions is contained a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of good.</p>

<p>84. In Tamar, then, the daughter-in-law of Judah, we see the people of the kingdom of Judah, whose kings, answering to Tamar's husbands, were taken from this tribe. Tamar means bitterness; and the meaning is suitable, for this people gave the cup of gall to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note140933"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;27:34</a></span> The two sons of Judah represent two classes of kings who governed ill&mdash; those who did harm and those who did no good. One of these sons was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or cruel before the Lord; the other spilled the seed on the ground that Tamar might not become a mother. There are only those two kinds of useless people in the world&mdash; the injurious and those who will not give the good they have but lose it or spill it on the ground. And as injury is worse than not doing good, the evil-doer is called the elder and the other the younger. Er, the name of the elder, means a preparer of skins, which were the coats given to our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> when they were punished with expulsion from paradise. <span class="stiki" id="note140934"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse21">Genesis&nbsp;3:21</a></span> Onan, the name of the younger, means, their grief; that is, the grief of those to whom he does no good, wasting the good he has on the earth. The loss of life implied in the name of the elder is a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than the want of help implied in the name of the younger. Both being killed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> typifies the removal of the kingdom from men of this character. The meaning of the third son of Judah not being joined to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, is that for a time the kings of Judah were not of that tribe. So this third son did not become the husband of Tamar; as Tamar represents the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, which continued to exist, although the people received no king from it. Hence the name of this son, Selom, means, his dismission. None of those types apply to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and righteous men who, like David, though they lived in those times, belong properly to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which they served by their enlightened predictions. Again, in the time when Judah ceased to have a king of its own tribe, the elder <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> does not count as one of the kings typified by the husbands of Tamar; for he was a foreigner, and his union with the people was never <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil. His was the power of a stranger, given him by the Romans and by C&aelig;sar. And it was the same with his sons, the tetrarchs, one of whom, called <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, like his father, agreed with <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> at the time of the Lord's passion. <span class="stiki" id="note140935"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;23:12</a></span> So plainly were these foreigners considered as distinct from the sacred monarchy of Judah, that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves, when raging against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, exclaimed openly, "We have no king but C&aelig;sar." <span class="stiki" id="note140936"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;19:15</a></span> Nor was C&aelig;sar properly their king, except in the sense that all the world was subject to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> thus condemned themselves, only to express their rejection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to flatter C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>85. The time when the kingdom was removed from the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a> was the time appointed for the coming of Christ our Lord, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Saviour, who should come not for harm, but for great good. Thus was it prophesied, "A prince shall not fail from Judah, nor a leader from his loins, till He come for whom it is reserved: He is the desire of nations." <span class="stiki" id="note140937"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;49:10</a></span> Not only the kingdom, but all government, of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had ceased, and also, as prophesied by Daniel, the sacred anointing from which the name Christ or Anointed is derived. Then came He for whom it was reserved, the desire of nations; and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies was anointed with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above His fellows.  Christ was born in the time of the elder <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and suffered in the time of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> the tetrarch. He who thus came to the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was typified by Judah when he went to shear his sheep in Thamna, which means, failing. For then the prince had failed from Judah, with all the government and anointing of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that He might come for whom it was reserved. Judah, we are told, came with his Adullamite shepherd, whose name was Iras; and Adullamite means, a testimony in water. So it was with this testimony that the Lord came, having indeed greater testimony than that of John; <span class="stiki" id="note140939"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;5:36</a></span> but for the sake of his feeble sheep he made use of the testimony in water. The name Iras, too, means, vision of my brother. So John saw his brother, a brother in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and from the relationship of Mary and <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a>; and the same person he recognised as his Lord and his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for, as he himself says, he received of His fullness. <span class="stiki" id="note140940"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;1:6</a></span> On account of this vision, among those born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, there has arisen no greater than he; <span class="stiki" id="note140941"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;11:11</a></span> because, of all who foretold Christ, he alone saw what many righteous men and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> desired to see and saw not. He saluted Christ from the womb; <span class="stiki" id="note140942"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;1:44</a></span> he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him more certainly from seeing the dove; and therefore, as the Adullamite, he gave testimony by water. The Lord came to shear His sheep, in releasing them from painful burdens, as it is said in praise of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the Song of Songs, that her teeth are like a flock of sheep after shearing. <span class="stiki" id="note140943"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse2">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:2</a></span> </p>

<p>86. Next, we have Tamar changing her dress; for Tamar also means changing. Still, the name of bitterness must be retained&mdash; not that bitterness in which gall was given to the Lord, but that in which Peter wept bitterly. <span class="stiki" id="note140944"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse75">Matthew&nbsp;26:75</a></span> For Judah means confession; and bitterness is mingled with confession as a type of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance. It is this repentance which gives fruitfulness to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> established among all nations. For "it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead, and that repentance and the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be preached among all nations in His name, beginning at Jerusalem." <span class="stiki" id="note140945"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;24:46-47</a></span> In the dress Tamar put on there is a confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and Tamar sitting in this dress at the gate of &AElig;nan or &AElig;naim, which means fountain, is a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> called from among the nations. She ran as a hart to the springs of water, to meet with the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; and there she is made fruitful by one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> her not, as it is foretold, "A people whom I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> shall serve me."  Tamar received under her disguise a ring, a bracelet, a staff; she is sealed in her calling, adorned in her justification, raised in her glorification. For "whom He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, them He also called: and whom He called, them He also justified: and whom He justified, them He also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140947"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse30">Romans&nbsp;8:30</a></span> This was while she was still disguised, as I have said; and in the same state she conceives, and becomes fruitful in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Also the kid promised is sent to her as to a harlot. The kid represents rebuke for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and it is sent by the Adullamite already mentioned, who, as it were, uses the reproachful words, "O generation of vipers!" <span class="stiki" id="note140948"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;3:7</a></span> But this rebuke for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not reach her, for she has been changed by the bitterness of confession. Afterwards, by exhibiting the pledges of the ring and bracelet and staff, she prevails over the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in their hasty judgment of her, who are now represented by Judah himself; as at this day we hear the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> saying that we are not the people of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and have not the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. But when we exhibit the sure tokens of our calling and justification and glorification, they will immediately be confounded, and will acknowledge that we are justified rather than they. I should enter into this more particularly, taking, as it were, each limb and joint separately, as the Lord might enable me, were it not that such minute inquiry is prevented by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of bringing this work to a close, for it is already longer than is desirable.</p>

<p>87. As regards the prophetic significance of David's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a single word must suffice. The names occurring in the narrative show what it typifies. David means, strong of hand, or desirable; and what can be stronger than the Lion of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, who has conquered the world, or more desirable than He of whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, "The desire of all nations shall come?" <span class="stiki" id="note140949"><a href="../bible/hag002.htm#verse8">Haggai&nbsp;2:8</a></span> Bersabee means, well of satisfaction, or seventh well: either of these interpretations will suit our purpose. So, in the Song of Songs, the spouse, who is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is called a well of living water; <span class="stiki" id="note140950"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse15">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:15</a></span> or again, the number seven represents the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as in the number of days in Pentecost, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> came from heaven. We learn also from the book of Tobit, that Pentecost was the feast of seven weeks. <span class="stiki" id="note140951"><a href="../bible/tob002.htm#verse1">Tobit&nbsp;2:1</a></span> To forty-nine, which is seven times seven, one is added to denote unity. To this effect is the saying of the apostle: "Bearing with one another in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." <span class="stiki" id="note140952"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;4:2-3</a></span> The Church becomes a well of satisfaction by this gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the number seven denoting its spirituality; for it is in her a fountain of living water springing up unto everlasting life, and he who has it shall never thirst. <span class="stiki" id="note140953"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;4:13-14</a></span> Uriah, Bersabee's husband, must, from the meaning of his name, be understood as representing the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. It is in union to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> that all are bound whom the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God sets free, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without spot or wrinkle may be married to her <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Saviour. Uriah means, my light of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and Hittite means, cut off, referring either to his not abiding in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when he was cut off on account of his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> from the celestial light which he had of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to his transforming himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light, because after losing his real strength by his fall, he still dares to say, My light is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The literal David, then, was guilty of a heinous crime, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> condemned in the rebuke addressed to David, and which David atoned for by his repentance. On the other hand, He who is the desire of all nations loved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> when washing herself on the roof, that is, when cleansing herself from the pollution of the world, and in spiritual <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> mounting above her house of clay, and trampling upon it; and after commencing an acquaintance, He puts to death the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, whom He first entirely removes from her, and joins her to Himself in perpetual union. While we <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we must not overlook the prophetical significance; and while we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as is His due, that David who in His mercy has freed us from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, we may also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the David who by the humility of his repentance healed the wound made by his transgression.</p>

<p>88. Little need be said of Solomon, who is spoken of in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> in terms of the strongest disapproval and condemnation, while nothing is said of his repentance and restoration to the divine favor. Nor can I find in his lamentable fall even a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> connection with anything good. Perhaps the strange <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> he lusted after may be thought to represent the Churches chosen from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. This idea might have been admissible, if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> had left their gods for Solomon's sake to worship his God. But as he for their sakes offended his God and worshipped their gods, it seems impossible to think of any good meaning. Doubtless, something is typified, but it is something bad, as in the case already explained of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife and daughters. We see in Solomon a notable pre-eminence and a notable fall. Now, this good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which we see in him at different periods, first good and then <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are in our day found together in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. What is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in Solomon represents, I think, the good members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and what was bad in him represents the bad members. Both are in one man, as the bad and the good are in the chaff and grain of one floor, or in the tares and wheat of one field. A closer inquiry into what is said of Solomon in Scripture might disclose, either to me or to others of greater learning and greater worth, some more probable interpretation. But as we are now engaged on a different subject, we must not allow this matter to break the connection of our discourse.</p>

<p>89. As regards the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Hosea, it is unnecessary for me to explain the meaning of the command, or of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> conduct, when God said to him, "Go and take unto you a wife of whoredoms and produce children of whoredoms," for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> itself informs us of the origin and purpose of this direction. It proceeds thus: "For the land has committed great whoredom, departing from the Lord. So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son. And the Lord said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a>, and will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to cease the kingdom of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the valley of Jezreel. And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name No-mercy: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; but I will utterly take them away. But I will have mercy upon the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a>, and will save them by the Lord their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. Now when she had weaned No-mercy, she conceived, and bare a son. Then said <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Call his name Not-my-people: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God. Yet the number of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured for multitude; and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them, You are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, You are the sons of the living God. Then shall the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and the children of Judah be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel. Say ye unto your brethren, My people; and to your sister, She has found mercy."  Since the typical meaning of the command and of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> conduct is thus explained in the same book by the Lord Himself, and since the writings of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> declare the fulfillment of this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, every one must accept the explanation thus given of the command and of the action of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> explanation. Thus it is said by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, "That He might make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared unto <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, even us, whom He has called, not of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> only, but also of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. As He says also in Hosea, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, You are not my people, there shall they be called the children of the living God." <span class="stiki" id="note140955"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;9:23-26</a></span> Here <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> applies the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. So also Peter, writing to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, without naming the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, borrows his expressions when he says, "But you are a chosen generation, a royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, a peculiar people; that you might show forth the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvellous light; which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy." <span class="stiki" id="note140956"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:9-10</a></span> From this it is plain that the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, "And the number of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured for multitude," and the words immediately following, "And it shall be that in the place where it was said unto them, You are not my people, there they shall be called the children of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," do not apply to that <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> which is after the flesh, but to that of which the apostle says to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, "You therefore are the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and heirs according to the promise." <span class="stiki" id="note140957"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse29">Galatians&nbsp;3:29</a></span> But, as many <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> after the flesh have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and will yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; for of these were the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and all the thousands in Jerusalem of the company of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, as also the churches of which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaks, when he says to the Galatians, "I was unknown by face to the churches of Jud&aelig;a which were in Christ;" <span class="stiki" id="note140958"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;1:22</a></span> and again, he explains the passage in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, where the Lord is called the cornerstone,  as referring to His uniting in Himself the two walls of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and uncircumcision, "that He might make in Himself of two one new man, so making peace; and that He might reconcile both unto God in one body by the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, having slain the enmity thereby: and that He might come and preach peace to them that are far off, and to them that are near," that is, to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; "for He is our peace, who has made of both one;" <span class="stiki" id="note140960"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse11">Ephesians&nbsp;2:11-22</a></span> to the same purpose we find the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> speaking of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as the children of Judah, and of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> as children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, where he says, "The children of Judah and the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be gathered together, and shall make to themselves one head, and shall go up from the land." Therefore, to speak against a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> thus confirmed by actual events, is to speak against the writings of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> as well as those of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and not only to speak against writings, but to impugn in the most reckless manner the evidence clear as noonday of established facts. In the case of the narrative of Judah, it is perhaps not so easy to recognize, under the disguise of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> called Tamar, the harlot representing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gathered from among the corruption of Gentile <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>; but here, where Scripture explains itself, and where the explanation is confirmed by the writings of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, instead of dwelling longer on this, we may proceed at once to inquire into the meaning of the very things to which Faustus objects in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>90. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> killing the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> in defending one of his brethren reminds us naturally of the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, our assailant in this land of strangers, by our defender the Lord Christ. And as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> hid the dead body in the sand, even so the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, though slain, remains concealed in those who are not firmly settled. The Lord, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, builds the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on a rock; and those who hear His word and do it, He compares to a wise man who builds his house upon a rock, and who does not yield or give way before <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; and those who hear and do not, He compares to a foolish man who builds on the sand, and when his house is tried its ruin is great. <span class="stiki" id="note140961"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;7:24-27</a></span> </p>

<p>91. Of the prophetic significance of the spoiling of the Egyptians, which was done by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> at the command of the Lord his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who commands nothing but what is most just, I remember to have set down what occurred to me at the time in my book entitled On <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Doctrine;  to the effect that the gold and silver and garments of the Egyptians typified certain branches of learning which may be profitably learned or taught among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. This may be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> explanation; or we may suppose that the vessels of gold and silver represent the precious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the garments the bodies, of those from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who join themselves to the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that along with them they may be freed from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> of this world. Whatever the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> interpretation may be, the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> student of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> will feel certain that in the command, in the action, and in the narrative there is a purpose and a symbolic meaning.</p>

<p>92. It would take too long to go through all the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. It is enough to refer to what has already been said, as sufficient for the purpose in this reply to Faustus of the prophetic and symbolic character of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Amalek.  There is also the charge of cruelty made against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by the enemies of Scriptures, or by those who have never read anything. Faustus does not make any specific charge, but speaks of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> as commanding and doing many cruel things. But, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the things they are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of bringing forward and of misrepresenting, I have already taken a particular case and have defended it, so that any <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> who are willing to be corrected, and all other <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and irreligious people, may see that there is no ground for their accusations. We must now inquire into the prophetic significance of the command, that many of those who, while <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was absent, made an idol for themselves should be slain without regard to relationship. It is easy to see that the slaughter of these men represents the warfare against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principles which led the people into the same <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Against such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> we are commanded to wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in the words of the psalm, "Be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not."  And a similar command is given by the apostle, when he says, "Mortify your members which are on earth fornication, uncleanness, luxury, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> concupiscence, and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140965"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> </p>

<p>93. It requires closer examination to see the meaning of the first action of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in burning the calf in fire, and grinding it to powder, and sprinkling it in the water for the people to drink. The tables given to him, written with the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, by the agency of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, he may have broken, because he judged the people unworthy of having them read to them; and he may have burned the calf, and ground it, and scattered it so as to be carried away by the water, in order to let nothing of it remain among the people. But why should he have made them drink it? Every one must feel anxious to discover the typical significance of this action. Pursuing the inquiry, we may find that in the calf there was an embodiment of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as there is in men of all nations who have the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> as their head or leader in their impious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. The calf is gold, because there is a semblance of wisdom in the institution of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> worship. Of this the apostle says, "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor were thankful; but they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise they became foolish, and changed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the incorruptible God into the likeness of corruptible man, and of birds, and of four-footed beasts, and of creeping things." <span class="stiki" id="note140966"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;1:21-23</a></span> From this so-called wisdom came the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">golden calf</a>, which was one of the forms of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> among the chief men and professed sages of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The calf, then, represents every body or society of Gentile idolaters. This impious society the Lord Christ burns with that fire of which He says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, "I have come to send fire on the earth;" <span class="stiki" id="note140967"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span> for, as there is nothing hid from His heat,  when the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him they lose the form of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in the fire of divine influence. Then all the body is ground, that is, after the dissolution of the combination in the membership of iniquity comes humiliation under the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Then the dust is sprinkled in the water, that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, that is, the preachers of the gospel, may in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> admit those formerly idolaters into their own body, that is, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. To Peter, who was one of those <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, it was said of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, "Kill, and eat." <span class="stiki" id="note140969"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;10:13</a></span> To kill and eat is much the same as to grind and drink. So this calf, by the fire of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and the keen penetration of the word, and the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, was swallowed up by the people, instead of their being swallowed up by it.</p>

<p>94. Thus, when the very passages on which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> found their objections to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are studied and examined, the more obscure they are the more wonderful are the secrets which we discover in reply to our questions; so that the mouths of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> are completely stopped, and the evidence of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> so stifles them that they cannot even utter a sound. The unhappy men who will not receive into their hearts the sweetness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must feel its force as a gag in their mouths. All those passages speak of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The head now ascended into heaven along with the body still suffering on earth is the full development of the whole purpose of the authors of Scripture, which is well called Sacred Scripture. Every part of the narrative in the prophetical books should be viewed as having a figurative meaning, except what serves merely as a framework for the literal or figurative predictions of this king and of his people. For as in harps and other musical instruments the musical sound does not come from all parts of the instrument, but from the strings, and the rest is only for fastening and stretching the strings so as to tune them, that when they are struck by the musician they may give a pleasant sound; so in these prophetical narratives the circumstances selected by the prophetic spirit either predict some future event, or if they have no voice of their own, they serve to connect together other significant utterances.</p>

<p>95. Should the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> reject our exposition of those allegorical narratives, or even insist on understanding them only in a literal sense, to dispute about such a difference of understanding would be as useless as to dispute about a difference of taste. Only, the fact that the divine precepts have either a moral and religious character or a prophetic meaning must be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, whether intelligently or not. Moreover, the figurative interpretations must all be in the interest of morality and religion. So, if the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> or any others disagree with our interpretation, or differ from us in method or in any particular opinion, suffice it that the character of the fathers whom God commends for their conduct and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to His precepts is vindicated on a principle which all but those inveterate in their hostility will acknowledge to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and that the purity and dignity of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are maintained in reference to those passages which the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> find fault with, where certain actions are either praised or blamed, or merely narrated for us to form a judgment of them.</p>

<p>96. In fact, nothing could have been devised more likely to instruct and benefit the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> reader of sacred Scripture than that, besides describing praiseworthy characters as examples, and blameworthy characters as warnings, it should also narrate cases where good men have gone back and fallen into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whether they are restored to the right path or continue irreclaimable; and also where bad men have changed, and have attained to goodness, whether they persevere in it or relapse into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; in order that the righteous may be not lifted up in the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of security, nor the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> hardened in despair of cure. And even those passages in Scripture which contain no examples or warnings are either required for connection, so as to pass on to essential matters, or, from their very appearance of superfluity, indicate the presence of some secret <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> meaning. For in the books we speak of, so far from there being a want or a scarcity of prophetical announcements, such announcements are numerous and distinct; and now that the fulfillment has actually taken place, the testimony thus borne to the divine authority of the books is irresistibly strong, so that it is mere <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to suppose that there can be any useless or unmeaning passages in books to which all classes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of minds do homage, and which themselves predict what we see thus actually coming to pass.</p>

<p>97. If, then, any one reading of the action of David, of which he repented when the Lord rebuked and threatened him, find in the narrative an encouragement to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is Scripture to be blamed for this? Is not the man's own guilt in proportion to the abuse which he makes for his own injury or destruction of what was written for his recovery and release? David is set forth as a great example of repentance, because men who fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either proudly disregard the cure of repentance, or lose themselves in despair of obtaining <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or of meriting pardon. The example is for the benefit of the sick, not for the injury of those in health. If madmen destroy themselves, or if evil-doers destroy others, with surgical instruments, it is not the fault of surgery.</p>

<p>98. Even supposing that our fathers the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, of whose devout and religious habits so good a report is given in that Scripture which every one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, and has not lost entirely the use of his reason, must admit to have been provided by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, were as lustful and cruel as the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> and fanatically allege, they might still be shown to be superior not only to those whom the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> call the Elect, but also to their god himself. Is there in the licentious intercourse of man with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> anything so bad as the self-abasement of unclouded light by mixture with darkness? Here, is a man prompted by <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and greed to pass off his wife as his sister and sell her to her lover; but worse still and more shocking, that one should disguise his own nature to gratify criminal passion, and submit gratuitously to pollution and degradation. Why, even one who knowingly lies with his own daughters is not equally criminal with one who lets his members share in the defilement of all sensuality as gross as this, or grosser. And is not the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> god a partaker in the contamination of the most atrocious acts of uncleanness? Again, if it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as Faustus says, that Jacob went from one to another of his four wives, not desiring offspring, but resembling a he-goat in licentiousness, he would still not be sunk so low as your god, who must not only have shared in this degradation, from his being confined in the bodies of Jacob and his wives so as to be mixed up with all their movements, but also, in union with this very he-goat of Faustus' coarse comparison, must have endured all the pains of animal appetite, incurring fresh defilement at every step, as partaking in the passion of the male, the conception of the female, and the birth of the kid. And, in the same way, supposing Judah to have been guilty not only of fornication, but of incest, a share in the heats and impurities of this incestuous passion would also belong to your god. David repented of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in loving the wife of another, and in ordering the death of her husband; but when will your god repent of giving up his members to the wanton passion of the male and female chiefs of the race of darkness, and of putting to death not the husband of his mistress, but his own children, whom he confines in the members of the very <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who were his own lovers? Even if David had not repented, nor been thus restored to righteousness, he would still have been better than your god. David may have been defiled by this one act, or to the extent to which one man is capable of such defilement; but your god suffers the pollution of his members in all such actions by whomsoever committed. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Hosea, too, is accused by Faustus: and, supposing him to have taken the harlot to wife because he had a criminal affection for her, if he is licentious and she a prostitute, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, according to your own assertion, are parts and members of your god and of his nature. In plain language, the harlot herself must be your god. You cannot pretend that your god is not confined in the contaminated body, or that he is only present, while preserving entire the purity of his own nature; and you acknowledge that the members of your god are so defiled as to require a special purification. This harlot, then, for whom you venture to find fault with the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even if she had not been changed for the better by becoming a chaste wife, would still have been your god; at least you must admit her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to have been a part, however small, of your god. But one single harlot is not so bad as your god, for he on account of his mixture with the race of darkness shares in every act of prostitution; and wherever such impurities are perpetrated, he goes through the corresponding experiences of abandonment, of release, and of confinement, and this from generation to generation, till this most corrupt part reaches its final state in the mass of darkness, like an irreclaimable harlot. Such are the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and such the shameful abominations which your god could not ward off from his members, and to which he was brought irresistibly by his merciless enemy; for only by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of his own subjects, or rather his own parts, could he effect the destruction of his formidable assailant. Surely, there was nothing so bad as this in killing an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> so as to preserve uninjured a fellow-countryman. Yet Faustus finds fault with this most absurdly, while with amazing infatuation he overlooks the case of his own god. Would it not have been better for him to have carried off the gold and silver vessels of the Egyptians, than to let his members be carried off by the race of darkness? And yet the worshippers of this unfortunate god find fault with the servant of our God for carrying on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, in which he with his followers were always victorious, so that, under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> carried captive their enemies, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as your god would have done too, if he had been able. You profess to accuse <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> of doing wrong, while in fact you <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> his success. There was no cruelty in punishing with the sword those who had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> grievously against God. Indeed, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> entreated pardon for this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even offering to bear himself in their stead the divine <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But even had he been cruel instead of compassionate, he would still have been better than your god. For if any of his followers had been sent to break the force of the enemy and had been taken captive, he would never, if victorious, have condemned him when he had done no wrong, but acted in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to orders. And yet this is what your god is to do with the part of himself which is to be fastened in the mass of darkness, because it <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> orders, and advanced at the risk of its own life in defence of his kingdom against the body of the enemy. But, says the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a>, this part, after mixture and combination with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> during the course of ages, has not been <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>. But why? If the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> was <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, the guilt is real, and the punishment just. But from this it would follow that there is no nature opposed to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; otherwise it would not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> voluntarily; and so the whole system of Manich&aelig;ism falls at once. If, again, this part suffers from the power of this enemy against whom it was sent, and is subdued by a force it was unable to resist, the punishment is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and flagrantly cruel. The god who is defended on the plea of necessity is a fit object of worship to those who refuse to worship the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Still, it must be allowed that, however debasing the worship of this god may be, the worshippers are so far better than their deity, that they have an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, while he is nothing more than a fabulous invention. Proceed we now to the rest of Faustus' vagaries. </p>
