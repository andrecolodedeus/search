<h1>Contra Faustum, Book XXV</h1>

<p><strong>Faustus seeks to bring into ridicule the orthodox claim to believe in the infinity of God by caricaturing the anthropomorphic representations of the Old Testament. Augustine expresses his despair of being able to induce the Manich&aelig;ans to adopt right views of the infinitude of God so long as they continue to regard the soul and God as extended in space.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: Is God finite or <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>? He must be finite unless you are mistaken in addressing Him as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Isaac and Jacob; unless, indeed, the being thus addressed is different from the God you call <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. In the case of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Isaac and Jacob, the mark of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which separated these men from fellowship with other people, marked also the limit of God's power as extending only to them. And a being whose power is finite cannot himself be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Moreover, in this address, you do not mention even the ancients before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>, and others like them, whom you allow to have been righteous though in uncircumcision; but because they lacked this distinguishing mark, you will not call God their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and his seed. Now, if God is one and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, what need of such careful particularity in addressing Him, as if it was not enough to name <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without adding whose God He is&mdash; <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a>, namely, and Isaac's and Jacob's; as if <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> were a landmark to steer by in your invocation, to escape shipwreck among a shoal of deities? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, may very properly address this deity, as having a reason for it, because they call God the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, in contrast to the gods of uncircumcision. But why you should do the same, it is difficult to understand; for you do not pretend to have <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> sign, though you invoke his God. If we understand the matter rightly, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and their God seem to have set marks upon one another for the purpose of recognition, that they might not lose each other. So God gave them the disgusting mark of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, that, in whatever land or among whatever people they might be, they might by being <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be His. They again marked God by calling Him the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers, that, wherever He might be, though among a crowd of gods, He might, on hearing the name God of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> at once that He was addressed. So we often see, in a number of people of the same name, that no one answers till called by his surname. In the same way the shepherd or herdsman makes use of a brand to prevent his property being taken by others. In thus marking God by calling Him the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Isaac and Jacob, you show not only that He is finite, but also that you have no connection with Him, because you have not the mark of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> by which He recognizes His own. Therefore, if this is the God you worship, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of His being finite. But if you say that God is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, you must first of all give up this finite deity, and by altering your invocation, show your penitence for your past <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. We have thus <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> God to be finite, taking you on your own ground. But to determine whether the supreme and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> or not, we need only refer to the opposition between good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. If <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does not exist, then certainly God is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; otherwise He must be finite. Evil, however, undoubtedly exists; therefore God is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. It is where good stops that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> begins.</p>

<p>2. <em>Augustine</em> replied: No one that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> you would dream of asking you about the infinitude of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or of discussing the matter with you. For, before there can be any degree of spirituality in any of your conceptions, you must first have your minds cleared by simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and by some elementary <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, from the illusions of carnal and material ideas. This your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> prevents you from doing, for it invariably represents the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and God as extended in space, either finite or <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, while the idea of space is applicable only to the body. As long as this is the case, it will be better for you to leave this matter alone; for you can teach no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> regarding it, any more than in other matters; and in this you are unfit for learning, as you might do in other things, if you were not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and quarrelsome. For in such questions as how God can be finite, when no space can contain Him; how He can be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, when the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him perfectly; how He can be finite, and yet unbounded; how He can be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and yet perfect; how He can be finite, who is without measure; how He can be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, who is the measure of all things&mdash; all carnal ideas go for nothing; and if the carnality is to be removed, it must first become ashamed of itself. Accordingly, your best way of ending the matter you have brought forward of God as finite or <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, is to say no more about it till you cease going so far astray from Christ, who is the end of the law. Of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Isaac and Jacob we have already said enough to show why He who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God of all creatures wished to be familiarly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by His people under this name. On <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, too, we have already spoken in several places in answer to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> reproaches. The <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> would find nothing to ridicule in this sign if they would view it as appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be an appropriate <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the putting off of the flesh. They ought thus to consider the rite with a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> instead of a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> mind; as it is written, "To the pure all things are pure." But, considering the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the following words, "To the unclean and unbelieving nothing is pure, but even their mind and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> are defiled," <span class="stiki" id="note140998"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse15">Titus&nbsp;1:15</a></span> we must remind our witty opponents, that if <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is indecent, as they say it is, they should rather weep than laugh at it; for their god is exposed to restraint and contamination in conjunction both with the skin which is cut and with the blood which is shed.</p>
