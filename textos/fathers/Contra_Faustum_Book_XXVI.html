<h1>Contra Faustum, Book XXVI</h1>

<p><strong>Faustus insists that Jesus might have died though not born, by the exercise of divine power, yet he rejects birth and death alike. Augustine maintains that there are some things that even God cannot do, one of which is to die. He refutes the docetism of the Manich&aelig;ans.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: You ask, If Jesus was not born, how did He die? Well this is a probability, such as one makes use of in want of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. We will, however, answer the question by examples taken from what you generally <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. If they are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, they will prove our case; if they are false, they will help you no more than they will us. You say then, How could Jesus die, if He were not man? In return, I ask you, How did Elias not die, though he was a man? Could a mortal encroach upon the limits of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and could not Christ add to His <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> whatever experience of death was required? If Elias, contrary to nature, lives for ever, why not allow that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, with no greater contrariety to nature, could remain in death for three days? Besides that, it is not only Elias, but <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and to have been taken up with their bodies to heaven. Accordingly, if it is a good argument that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was a man because He died, it is an equally good argument that Elias was not a man because he did not die. But as it is false that Elias was not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, notwithstanding his supposed <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, so it is false that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, though He is considered to have died. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, if you will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it, that the Hebrews were in a mistake regarding both the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of Elias. For it is equally untrue that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died and that Elias did not die. But you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> whatever you please; and for the rest, you appeal to nature. And, allowing this appeal, nature is against both the death of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the mortal. And if we refer to the power of effecting their purpose as possessed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and by man, it seems more possible for Jesus to die than for Elias not to die; for the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is greater than that of Elias. But if you exalt the weaker to heaven, though nature is against it, and, forgetting his condition as a mortal, endow him with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> felicity, why should I not admit that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> could die if He pleased, even though I were to grant His death to have been real, and not a mere semblance? For, as from the outset of His taking the likeness of man He underwent in appearance all the experiences of humanity, it was quite consistent that He should complete the system by appearing to die.</p>

<p>2. Moreover, it is to be remembered that this reference to what nature grants as possible, should be made in connection with all the history of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and not only with His death. According to nature, it is impossible that a man blind from his birth should see the light; and yet Jesus appears to have performed a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of this kind, so that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves exclaimed that from the beginning of the world it was not seen that one opened the eyes of a man born blind. <span class="stiki" id="note140999"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm">John&nbsp;ix</a></span> So also healing a withered hand, giving the power of utterance and expression to those born dumb, restoring animation to the dead, with the recovery of their bodily frame after dissolution had begun, produce a feeling of amazement, and must seem utterly incredible in view of what is naturally possible and impossible. And yet, as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all the things to have been done by the same person; for we regard not the law of nature, but the powerful operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. There is a story, too, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> having been cast from the brow of a hill, and having escaped unhurt. If, then, when thrown down from a height He did not die, simply because He chose not to die, why should He not have had the power to die when He pleased? We take this way of answering you because you have a fancy for discussion, and affect to use <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> weapons not properly belonging to you. As regards our own belief, it is no more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died than that Elias is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.</p>

<p>3. <em>Augustine</em> replied: As to <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> and Elias and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, our belief is determined not by Faustus' suppositions, but by the declarations of Scripture, resting as they do on foundations of the strongest and surest evidence. People in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as you are, are unfit to decide what is natural, and what contrary to nature. We admit that what is contrary to the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> experience is commonly spoken of as contrary to nature. Thus the apostle uses the words, "If you are cut out of the wild olive, and engrafted contrary to nature in the good olive." <span class="stiki" id="note141000"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;11:24</a></span> Contrary to nature is here used in the sense of contrary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> experience of the course of nature; as that a wild olive engrafted in a good olive should bring forth the fatness of the olive instead of wild berries. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Author and Creator of all natures, does nothing contrary to nature; for whatever is done by Him who appoints all natural order and measure and proportion must be natural in every case. And man himself acts contrary to nature only when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and then by punishment he is brought back to nature again. The natural order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> requires either that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should not be committed or that it should not go unpunished. In either case, the natural order is preserved, if not by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, at least by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> pains the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and brings grief on the mind of the sinner, by the loss of the light of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, even should no physical sufferings follow, which are inflicted for correction, or are reserved for the incorrigible. There is, however, no impropriety in saying that God does a thing contrary to nature, when it is contrary to what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of nature. For we give the name nature to the usual common course of nature; and whatever God does contrary to this, we call a prodigy, or a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. But against the supreme law of nature, which is beyond the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> both of the ungodly and of weak <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, God never acts, any more than He acts against Himself. As regards spiritual and rational beings, to which class the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> belongs, the more they partake of this unchangeable law and light, the more clearly they see what is possible, and what impossible; and again, the greater their distance from it, the less their perception of the future, and the more frequent their surprise at strange occurrences.</p>

<p>4. Thus of what happened to Elias we are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; but still we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the truthful declarations of Scripture regarding him. Of one thing we are certain, that what God willed happened, and that except by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> nothing can happen to any one. So, if I am told that it is possible that the flesh of a certain man shall be changed into a celestial body, I allow the possibility, but I cannot tell whether it will be done; and the reason of my <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is, that I am not acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the matter. That it will be done if it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, is perfectly clear and indubitable. Again, if I am told that something would happen if God did not prevent it from happening, I reply confidently that what is to happen is the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not the event which might otherwise have happened. For God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> His own future action, and therefore He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also the effect of that action in preventing the happening of what would otherwise have happened; and, beyond all question, what God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> is more certain than what man thinks. Hence it is as impossible for what is future not to happen, as for what is past not to have happened; for it can never be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that anything should, in the same sense, be both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and false. Therefore all that is properly future cannot but happen; what does not happen never was future; even as all things which are properly in the past did indubitably take place.</p>

<p>5. Accordingly, to say, if God is almighty, let Him make what has been done to be undone, is in fact to say, if God is almighty, let Him make a thing to be in the same sense both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and false. God can put an end to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of anything, when the thing to be put an end to has a present <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; as when He puts an end by death to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of any one who has been brought into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in birth; for in this case there is an actual <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> which may be put a stop to. But when a thing does not exist, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> cannot be put a stop to. Now, what is past no longer exists and whatever has an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> which can be put an end to cannot be past. What is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> past is no longer present; and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of its past <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is in our judgment, not in the thing itself which no longer exists. The proposition asserting anything to be past is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> when the thing no longer exists. God cannot make such a proposition false, because He cannot contradict the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in this case, or the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment, is first of all in our own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, when we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and give expression to it. But should it disappear from our minds by our forgetting it, it would still remain as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It will always be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the past thing which is no longer present had an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of its past <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> after it has stopped is the same as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of its future <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> before it began to be. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> cannot be contradicted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom abides the supreme and unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and whose illumination is the source of all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be found in any mind or understanding. Now God is not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> in the sense of being able to die; nor does this inability prevent His being <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. True omnipotence belongs to Him who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> exists, and who alone is the source of all <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, both spiritual and corporeal. The Creator makes what use He pleases of all His creatures; and His pleasure is in harmony with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and unchangeable <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, by which, as by His own nature, He, Himself unchangeable, brings to pass the changes of all changeable things according to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of their natures or of their actions. No one, therefore, would be so foolish as to deny that Elias being a creature of God could be changed either for the worse or for the better; or that by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> God he could be changed in a manner unusual among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. So we can have no reason for doubting what on the high authority of Scripture is related of him, unless we limit the power of God to things which we are familiar with.</p>

<p>6. Faustus' argument is, If Elias who was a man could escape death, why might not Christ have the power of dying, since He was more than man? This is the same as to say, If <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be changed for the better, why should not the divine nature be changed for the worse?&mdash; a weak argument, seeing that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is changeable, while the divine nature is not. Such a method of inference would lead to the glaring absurdity, that if God can bestow <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on man, He must also have the power of consigning Himself to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> misery. Faustus will reply that his argument refers only to three days of death for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as compared with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life for man. Well, if you understood the three days of death in the sense of the death of the flesh which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> took as a part of our mortal nature, you would be quite correct; for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the gospel makes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that the death of Christ for three days was for the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life of men. But in arguing that there is no impropriety in asserting a death of three days of the divine nature itself, without any assumption of mortality, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be endowed with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, you display the folly of one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> neither God nor the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And indeed, since you make part of your god to be fastened to the mass of darkness for ever, how can you escape the absurd conclusion already mentioned, that God consigns Himself to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> misery? You will then require to prove that part of light is light, while part of God is not God. To give you in a word, without argument, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as regards Elias having been caught up to heaven from the earth, though only a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and as regards Christ being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> dying on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, our belief in both cases is grounded on the declaration of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>,  which it is <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and impiety to disbelieve. What is said of Elias you pretend to deny, for you will pretend anything. Regarding Christ, although even you do not go the length of saying that He could not die, though He could be born, still you deny His birth from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and assert His death on the cross to have been feigned, which is equivalent to denying it too, except as a mockery for the delusion of men; and you allow so much merely to obtain indulgence for your own falsehoods from the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in these fictions.</p>

<p>7. The question which Faustus makes it appear that he is asked by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, If Jesus was not born, how could He die? Could be asked only by one who overlooked the fact that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> died, though he was not born. Who will venture to say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> could not, if He had pleased, have made for Himself a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body in the same way as He did for Adam; for all things were made by Him? <span class="stiki" id="note141002"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> or who will deny that He who is the Almighty Son of the Almighty could, if He had chosen, have taken a body from a heavenly substance, or from air or vapor, and have so changed it into the precise character of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, as that He might have lived as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and have died in it? Or, once more, if He had chosen to take a body of none of the material substances which He had made, but to create for Himself from nothing real flesh, as all things were created by Him from nothing, none of us will oppose this by saying that He could not have done it. The reason of our believing Him to have been born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, is not that He could not otherwise have appeared among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body, but because it is so written in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, which we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in order to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, or to be saved. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, then, that Christ was born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, because it is so written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He died on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, because it is so written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that both His birth and death were real, because the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is no fiction. Why He chose to suffer all these things in a body taken from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is a matter <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only to Himself. Perhaps He took this way of giving importance and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to both the sexes which He had created, taking the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and being born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; or there may have been some other reason, we cannot tell. But this may be confidently affirmed, that what took place was exactly as we are told in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narrative, and that what the wisdom of God determined upon was exactly what ought to have happened. We place the authority of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> above all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> discussions; and we admire the counsel of divine wisdom more than any counsel of any creature.</p>

<p>8. Faustus calls upon us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him, and says, The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, if you will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it, that the Hebrews were in a mistake regarding both the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of Elias. And a little after he adds, As from the outset of His taking the likeness of man He underwent in appearance all the experiences of humanity, it was quite consistent that He should seal the dispensation by appearing to die. How can this <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> liar, who declares that Christ feigned death, expect to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? Did Christ utter <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> when He said, "It behooves the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> to be killed, and to rise the third day?" <span class="stiki" id="note141003"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;24:7</a></span> And do you tell us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what you say, as if you utter no falsehoods? In that case, Peter was more truthful than Christ when he said to Him, "Be it far from You, Lord; this shall not be unto You;" for which it was said to him, "Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141004"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;16:22-23</a></span> This rebuke was not lost upon Peter, for, after his correction and full preparation, he preached even to his own death the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But if Peter deserved to be called <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> for thinking that Christ would not die, what should you be called, when you not only deny that Christ died, but assert that He feigned death? You give, as a reason for Christ's appearing to die, that He underwent in appearance all the experiences of humanity. But that He feigned all the experiences of humanity is only your opinion in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. In reality, when the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> slept, <span class="stiki" id="note141005"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;8:24</a></span> that He was hungry, <span class="stiki" id="note141006"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;4:2</a></span> that He was thirsty, <span class="stiki" id="note141007"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;19:28</a></span> that He was sorrowful, <span class="stiki" id="note141008"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;26:37</a></span> or glad, and so on&mdash;these things are all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the senseof not being feigned, but actual experiences; only that they were undergone, not from a mere natural necessity, but in the exercise of a controlling will, and of divine power. In the case of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, sorrow, sleeping, being hungry and thirsty, are often involuntary; in Christ they were acts of His own will. So also men are born without any act of their own will, and suffer against their will; while Christ was born and suffered by His own will. Still, the things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and the accurate narrative of them is intended to instruct whoever believes in Christ's gospel in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not to delude him with falsehoods.</p>
