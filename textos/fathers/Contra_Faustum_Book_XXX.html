<h1>Contra Faustum, Book XXX</h1>

<p><strong>Faustus repels the insinuation that the prophecy of Paul with reference to those that should forbid to marry, abstain from meats, etc., applies to the Manich&aelig;ans more than to the Catholic ascetics, who are held in the highest esteem in the Church. Augustine justifies this application of the prophecy, and shows the difference between Manich&aelig;an and Christian asceticism.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: You apply to us the words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: "Some shall depart from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, giving heed to lying spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> seared as with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, abstaining from meats, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has created to be received with thanksgiving by <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141017"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:1-3</a></span> I refuse to admit that the apostle said this, unless you first acknowledge that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> taught doctrines of devils, and were the interpreters of a lying and malignant spirit; since they enjoin with great emphasis abstinence from swine's flesh and other meats, which they call unclean. This case must first be settled; and you must consider long and carefully how their teaching is to be viewed: whether they said these things from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. As regards these matters, either <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> must be condemned along with us; or we must be acquitted along with them. You are <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> in condemning us, as you do now, as followers of the doctrine of devils, because we require the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> class to abstain from animal food; for we limit the prohibition to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, while you hold that your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself, who forbade all classes of men to eat the flesh of swine, and hares, and conies, besides all varieties of cuttle-fish, and all fish wanting scales, said this not in a lying spirit, nor in the doctrine of devils, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Even supposing, then, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said these words, you can convince me only by condemning <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and so, though you will not do it for reason or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you will contradict <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> for the sake of your belly.</p>

<p>2. Besides, you have in your Book of Daniel the account of the three youths, which you will find it difficult to reconcile with the opinion that to abstain from meats is the doctrine of devils. For we are told that they abstained not only from what the law forbade, but even from what it allowed; <span class="stiki" id="note141018"><a href="../bible/dan001.htm#verse12">Daniel&nbsp;1:12</a></span> and you are wont to praise them, and count them as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; though they too followed the doctrine of devils, if this is to be taken as the apostle's opinion. And Daniel himself declares that he fasted for three weeks, not eating flesh or drinking wine, while he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for his people. <span class="stiki" id="note141019"><a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse2">Daniel&nbsp;10:2-3</a></span> How is it that he boasts of this doctrine of devils, and glories in the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of a lying spirit?</p>

<p>3. Again, what are we to think of you, or of the better class of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> among you, some of whom abstain from swine's flesh, some from the flesh of quadrupeds, and some from all animal food, while all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> admires them for it, and regards them with profound veneration, as only not gods? You obstinately refuse to consider that if the words quoted from the apostle are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and genuine, these people too are misled by doctrines of devils. And there is another observance which no one will venture to explain away or to deny, for it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all, and is practised yearly with particular attention in the congregation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> all over the world&mdash; I mean the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">fast of forty days</a>, in the due observance of which a man must abstain from all the things which, according to this verse, were created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that we might receive them, while at the same time he calls this abstinence a doctrine of devils. So, my dear friends, shall we say that you too, during this fast, while celebrating the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> passion, live after the manner of devils, and are deluded by a seducing spirit, and speak lies in hypocrisy, and have your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> seared with a hot iron? If this does not apply to you, neither does it apply to us. What is to be thought of this verse, or its author; or to whom does it apply, since it agrees neither with the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, nor with the institutions of the New? As regards the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is from your own practice; and though the Old requires abstinence only from certain things, still it requires abstinence. On the other hand, this opinion of yours makes all abstinence from animal food a doctrine of devils. If this is your belief, once more I say it, you must condemn <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and reject the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and pass the same sentence on yourselves; for, as they always abstained from certain kinds of food, so you sometimes abstain from all food.</p>

<p>4. But if you think that in making a distinction in food, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> established a divine ordinance, and not a doctrine of devils; if Daniel in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> observed a fast of three weeks; if the youths Ananias, Azarias, and Mishael, under divine guidance, chose to live on cabbage or pulse; if, again, those among you who abstain, do it not at the instigation of devils; if your abstinence from wine and flesh for forty days is not superstitious, but by divine command&mdash;consider, I beseech you, if it is not perfect <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to suppose these words to be <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> that abstinence from food and forbidding to marry are doctrines of devils. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> cannot have said that to dedicate <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to Christ is a doctrine of devils. But you read the words, and inconsiderately, as usual, apply them to us, without seeing that this stamps your <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> too as led away by the doctrine of devils, and that you are the functionaries of the devils in your constant endeavors to induce <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to make this profession, so that in all your churches the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> nearly outnumber the married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Why do you still adhere to such practises? Why do you ensnare wretched young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, if it is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of devils, and not of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that they fulfill? But, first of all, I wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if making <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> is, in all cases, the doctrine of devils, or only the prohibition of marriage. If it is the prohibition, it does not apply to us, for we too hold it equally foolish to prevent one who wishes, as it is criminal and impious to force one who has some reluctance. But if you say that to encourage the proposal, and not to resist such a desire, is all the doctrine of devils, to say nothing of the consequence as regards you, the apostle himself will be thus brought into danger, if he must be considered as having introduced the doctrines of devils into Iconium, when Thecla, after having been <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, was by his discourse inflamed with the desire of perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.  And what shall we say of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the Master Himself, and the source of all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, who is the unwedded spouse of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who make this profession, and who, when specifying in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> three kinds of eunuchs, natural, artificial, and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, gives the palm to those who have "made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141021"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;19:12</a></span> meaning the youths of both sexes who have extirpated from their hearts the desire of marriage, and who in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> act as eunuchs of the King's palace? Is this also the doctrine of devils? Are those words, too, spoken in a seducing spirit? And if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Christ are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of devils, is not their spirit the same that speaks in God? I do not mention the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of our Lord, Peter, Andrew, Thomas, and the example of celibacy, the blessed John, who in various ways commended to young men and maidens the excellence of this profession, leaving to us, and to you too, the form for making <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. I do not mention them, because you do not admit them into the canon, and so you will not scruple impiously to impute to them doctrines of devils. But will you say the same of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, who, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, everywhere expressed the same preference for unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to the married, and gave an example of it in the case of the saintly Thecla? But if the doctrine preached by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to Thecla, and which the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> also preached, was not the doctrine of devils, how can we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> left on record his opinion, that the very exhortation to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> is the injunction and the doctrine of devils? To make <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> simply by exhortation, without forbidding to marry, is not peculiar to you. That is our principle too; and he must be not only a fool, but a madman, who thinks that a private law can forbid what the public law allows. As regards marriage, therefore, we too encourage <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to remain as they are when they are willing to do so; we do not make them <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> against their will. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the force of will and of natural appetite when opposed by public law; much more when the law is only private, and every one is at liberty to disobey it. If, then, it is no crime to make <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in this manner, we are guiltless as well as you. If it is wrong to make <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in any way, you are guilty as well as we. So that what you mean, or intend, by quoting this verse against us, it is impossible to say.</p> 

<p>5. <em>Augustine</em> replied: Listen, and you shall hear what we mean and intend by quoting this verse against you, since you say that you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. It is not that you abstain from animal food; for, as you observe, our ancient fathers abstained from some kinds of food, not, however, as condemning them, but with a typical meaning, which you do not understand, and of which I have said already in this work all that appeared necessary. Besides, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, not <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, in order to subdue the body, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be more humbled in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, abstain not only from animal food, but also from some vegetable productions, without, however, believing them to be unclean. A few do this always; and at certain seasons or days, as in Lent, almost all, more or less, according to the choice or ability of individuals. You, on the other hand, deny that the creature is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and call it unclean, saying that animals are made by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> of the worst impurities in the substance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and so you reject them with horror, as being the most cruel and loathsome places of confinement of your god. You, as a concession, allow your followers, as distinct from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to eat animal food; as the apostle allows, in certain cases, not marriage in the general sense, but the indulgence of passion in marriage. <span class="stiki" id="note141022"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:5-6</a></span> It is only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is thus made allowance for. This is the feeling you have toward all animal food; you have learned it from your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and you teach it to your followers. You make allowance for your followers, because, as I said before, they supply you with necessaries; but you grant them indulgence without saying that it is not sinful. For yourselves, you shun contact with this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and impurity; and hence our reason for quoting this verse against you is found in the words of the apostle which follow those with which you end the quotation. Perhaps it was for this reason that you left out the words, and then say that you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what we mean or intend by the quotation; for it suited you better to omit the account of our intention than to express it. For, after speaking of abstaining from meats, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has created to be received with thanksgiving by <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, the apostle goes on, "And by them who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for every creature of God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141023"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:3-5</a></span> This you deny; for your idea, and motive, and belief in abstaining from such food is, that they are not typically, but naturally, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and impure. In this assuredly you <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the Creator; and in this is the doctrine of devils. You need not be surprised that, so long before the event, this prediction regarding you was made by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>6. So, again, if your exhortations to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> resembled the teaching of the apostle, "He who gives in marriage does well, and he who gives not in marriage does better;" <span class="stiki" id="note141024"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse38">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:38</a></span> if you taught that marriage is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> better, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> teaches which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Christ's Church, you would not have been described in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit's</a> prediction as forbidding to marry. What a man forbids he makes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but a good thing may be placed second to a better thing without being forbidden. Moreover, the only <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> kind of marriage, or marriage entered into for its proper and legitimate purpose, is precisely that you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> most. So, though you may not forbid sexual intercourse, you forbid marriage; for the peculiarity of marriage is, that it is not merely for the gratification of passion, but, as is written in the contract, for the procreation of children. And, though you allow many of your followers to retain their connection with you in spite of their refusal, or their inability, to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> you, you cannot deny that you make the prohibition. The prohibition is part of your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>, while the toleration is only for the interests of the society. And here we see the reason, which I have delayed till now to mention, for your making not the birth but only the death of Christ feigned and illusory. Death being the separation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of your god, from the body which belongs to his enemies, for it is the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, you uphold and approve of it; and thus, according to your creed, it was meet that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though He did not die, should commend death by appearing to die. In birth, again, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> your god to be bound instead of released; and so you will not allow that Christ was born even in this illusory fashion. You would have thought better of Mary had she ceased to be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> without being a mother, than as being a mother without ceasing to be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. You see, then, that there is a great difference between exhorting to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> as the better of two <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and forbidding to marry by denouncing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> purpose of marriage; between abstaining from food as a symbolic observance, or for the mortification of the body, and abstaining from food which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has created for the reason that God did not create it. In one case, we have the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; in the other, the doctrine of lying devils.</p>
