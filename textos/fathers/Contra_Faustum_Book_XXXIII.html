<h1>Contra Faustum, Book XXXIII</h1>

<p><strong>Faustus does not think it would be a great honor to sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, whose moral characters as set forth in the Old Testament he detests. He justifies his subjective criticism of Scripture. Augustine sums up the argument, claims the victory, and exhorts the Manich&aelig;ans to abandon their opposition to the Old Testament notwithstanding the difficulties that it presents, and to recognize the authority of the Catholic Church.</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>Faustus</em> said: You quote from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the words, "Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141073"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;8:11</a></span> and ask why we do not acknowledge the patriarchs. Now, we should be the last to grudge to any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should have compassion on him, and bring him out of perdition to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. At the same time, we should acknowledge in such a case the clemency shown in this act of compassion, and not the merit of the person whose life is undeniably blameworthy. Thus, in the case of the Jewish fathers, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, who are mentioned by Christ in this verse, supposing it to be genuine, although they led <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> lives, as we may learn from their descendant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, or whoever was the author of the history called Genesis, which describes their conduct as having been most shocking and detestable; we are ready to allow that they may, after all, be in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, in the place which they neither <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in, nor hoped for, as is plain enough from their books. But then it must be kept in mind that, as you yourselves confess, if they did attain to what is spoken of in this verse, it was something very different from the nether dungeons of woe to which their own deserts consigned them, and that their deliverance was the work of our Lord Christ, and the result of His mystic passion. Who would grudge to the thief on the cross that deliverance was granted to him by the same Lord, and that Christ said that on that very day he should be with Him in the paradise of His Father? <span class="stiki" id="note141074"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;23:43</a></span> Who is so hard-hearted as to disapprove of this act of benevolence? Still, it does not follow that, because Jesus pardoned a thief, we must approve of the habits and practices of thieves; any more than of the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and harlots, whose faults Jesus pardoned, declaring that they would go into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> before those who behaved proudly. <span class="stiki" id="note141075"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;21:31</a></span> For, when He acquitted the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> accused by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as sinful, and as having been caught in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, He told her to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more. <span class="stiki" id="note141076"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;8:3-11</a></span> If, then, He has done something of the same kind in the case of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, all the praise is His; for such actions towards <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are becoming in Him who makes His sun to rise upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and upon the good, and sends rain on the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note141077"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> One thing perplexes me in your doctrine: why you limit your statements to the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and are not of opinion that the Gentile patriarchs had also a share in this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of our Redeemer; especially as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Church consists of their children more than of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob. You will say that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> worshipped <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> the Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that therefore Jesus had regard only to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. It would seem from this that the worship of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> is the sure way to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and that the Son must come to the aid of the worshipper of the Father. That is as you please. For my part, I am ready to join you in the belief that the fathers reached heaven, not by any merit of their own, but by that divine mercy which is stronger than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>2. However, there is a difficulty in deciding as regards this verse too, whether the words were really spoken to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for there is a discrepancy in the narratives. For while two <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, Matthew and Luke, both alike tell of the centurion whose servant was sick, and to whom these words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> are supposed to have applied, that He had not seen so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, no, not in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as in this man, though a Gentile and a Pagan, because he said that he was not worthy that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> should come under his roof, but wished Him only to speak the word, and his servant should be healed; Matthew alone adds that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went on to say, "Verily I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall sit down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; but the children of the kingdom shall be cast into outer darkness." By the many who should come are meant the Pagans, on account of the centurion, in whom, although he was a Gentile, so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was found; and the children of the kingdom are the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in whom there was no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> found. Luke, again, though he too mentions the occurrence in his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> as part of the narrative of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, says nothing of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob. If it is said that he omitted it because it had been already said by Matthew, why does he tell the story at all of the centurion and his servant, since that, too, has the advantage of being recorded at length in Matthew's ingenious narrative? But the passage is corrupt. For, in describing the centurion's application to Jesus, Matthew says that he came himself to ask for a cure; while Luke says he did not, but sent elders of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and that they, in case Jesus should despise the centurion as a Gentile (for they will have Jesus to be a thorough Jew), set about persuading Him, by saying that he was worthy for whom He should do this, because he loved their nation, and had built them a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>;  here again taking for granted that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was concerned in a pagan centurion having thought it proper to build a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The words in question are, indeed, found in Luke also, perhaps because on reflection he thought they might be genuine; but they are found in another place, and in a connection altogether different. The passage is where Jesus says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, "Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many shall come seeking to enter in, and shall not be able. When once the Master of the house has entered in, and has shut to the door, you shall begin to stand without, and to knock, saying Lord, open to us. And He shall answer and say, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you not. Then you shall begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in Your presence, and You have taught in our streets and <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>; but He shall say unto you, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whence you are; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, entering into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, and you yourselves cast out. And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141079"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse24">Luke&nbsp;13:24-29</a></span> The part where it is said that many shall be shut out of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, who have only borne the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, without doing His works, is not left out by Matthew; but he makes no mention here of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob. In the same way, Luke mentions the centurion and his servant, without alluding in that connection to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob. Since it is uncertain when the words were spoken, we are at liberty to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether they were spoken at all.</p>

<p>3. It is not without reason that we bring a critical judgment to the study of Scriptures where there are such discrepancies and contradictions. By thus examining everything, and comparing one passage with another, we determine which contains Christ's actual words, and what may or may not be genuine. For your predecessors have made many interpolations in the words of our Lord, which thus appear under His name, while they disagree with His doctrine. Besides, as we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> again and again, the writings are not the production of Christ or of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but a compilation of rumors and beliefs, made, long after their departure, by some obscure semi-<a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, not in harmony even with one another, and published by them under the name of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, or of those considered the followers of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, so as to give the appearance of apostolic authority to all these blunders and falsehoods. But whatever you make of that, as regards this verse, I repeat that I do not insist on rejecting it. It is enough for my position, that, as I said before, and as you are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confess, before the coming of our Lord all the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> lay in infernal darkness for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Even though they may have been restored to light and liberty by Christ, that has nothing to do with the hateful character of their lives. We <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> and eschew not their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but their characters; not as they are now, when they are purified, but as they were, when impure. So, whatever you think of this verse, it does not affect us: for if it is genuine, it only illustrates Christ's goodness and compassion; and if it is spurious, those who wrote it are to blame. Our <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is as safe as it always is.</p>

<p>4. <em>Augustine</em> replied: Poor safety, indeed! When you contradict yourself by hating the patriarchs as impure, at the same time that you grieve for your impure god. You allow that, since the advent of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, the patriarchs have had purity restored, and have enjoyed the rest of the blessed; while your god, even after the Saviour's advent, still lies in darkness, is still sunk in the ocean of iniquity, still wallows in the mire of all uncleanness. These men, therefore, were not only better than your god in their lives, but also happier in their death. Where was the abode of the just who departed from this life before Christ's coming in the flesh, and whether their condition also was improved by the passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whom they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> as to come, and to suffer, and to rise again, and had, moreover, foretold this in suitable language under the guidance of the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, is to be discovered from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, if any clear discovery in this matter is possible; we are not called on to adopt the crude notions of all and sundry, still less the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> opinions of men who have gone astray into such egregious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. There is a vain attempt here on the part of Faustus to introduce by a side-door the idea that we may obtain something after this life besides the due reward of our conduct in this life. It will be better for you to abandon your <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> while you are still alive, and to embrace and hold the truths of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Otherwise the expectations of the unrighteous will be sadly disappointed when God begins to fulfill His threatenings to the unrighteous.</p>

<p>5. I have already given what I considered a sufficient answer to Faustus' <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of the lives of the patriarchs. That they were punished at their death, or that they were justified after the Lord's passion, is not what we learn from His commendation of them, when He admonished the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that, if they were <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children, they should do the works of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and said that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> desired to see His day, and was glad when he saw it; <span class="stiki" id="note141080"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;8:39,&nbsp;56</a></span> and that it was into his bosom, that is, some deep recess of blissful repose, that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> carried the poor sufferer who was despised by the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> rich man. <span class="stiki" id="note141081"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;16:23</a></span> And what are we to make of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>? Is there any idea of justification after death in his praise of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, when he says that before he was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that it was counted to him for righteousness? <span class="stiki" id="note141082"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;4:3</a></span> And so much importance does he attach to this, that the single ground which he specifies for our becoming <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children, though not descended from him in the flesh, is, that we follow the footsteps of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>6. You are so hardened in your <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> against the testimonies of Scripture, that nothing can be made of you; for whenever anything is quoted against you, you have the boldness to say that it is written not by the apostle, but by some pretender under his name. The doctrine of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> which you preach is so opposed to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine, that you could not continue, as professing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, to maintain it, unless you denied the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the apostolic writings. How can you thus do injury to your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>? Where will you find any authority, if not in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and apostolic writings? How can we be sure of the authorship of any book, if we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the apostolic origin of those books which are attributed to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves founded, and which occupies so conspicuous a place in all lands, and if at the same time we acknowledge as the undoubted production of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> what is brought forward by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose authors, from whom they derive their name, lived long after the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? And do we not see in profane literature that there are well-known authors under whose names many things have been published after their time which have been rejected, either from inconsistency with their ascertained writings, or from their not having been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the lifetime of the authors, so as to be banded down with the confirmatory statement of the authors themselves, or of their friends? To give a single example, were not some books published lately under the name of the distinguished physician Hippocrates, which were not received as authoritative by physicians? And this decision remained unaltered in spite of some similarity in style and matter: for, when compared to the genuine writings of Hippocrates, these books were found to be inferior; besides that they were not recognized as his at the time when his authorship of his genuine productions was ascertained. Those books, again, from a comparison with which the productions of questionable origin were rejected, are with certainty attributed to Hippocrates; and any one who denies their authorship is answered only by ridicule, simply because there is a succession of testimonies to the books from the time of Hippocrates to the present day, which makes it unreasonable either now or hereafter to have any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on the subject. How do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the authorship of the works of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, Aristotle, Cicero, Varro, and other similar writers, but by the unbroken chain of evidence? So also with the numerous commentaries on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> books, which have no canonical authority, and yet show a desire of usefulness and a spirit of inquiry. How is the authorship ascertained in each case, except by the author's having brought his work into public notice as much as possible in his own lifetime, and, by the transmission of the information from one to another in continuous order, the belief becoming more certain as it becomes more general, up to our own day; so that, when we are questioned as to the authorship of any book, we have no difficulty in answering? But why speak of old books? Take the books now before us: should any one, after some years, deny that this book was written by me, or that Faustus' was written by him, where is evidence for the fact to be found but in the information possessed by some at the present time, and transmitted by them through successive generations even to distant times? From all this it follows, that no one who has not yielded to the malicious and deceitful suggestions of lying devils, can be so blinded by passion as to deny the ability of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>&mdash; a community of brethren as numerous as they were faithful&mdash; to transmit their writings unaltered to posterity, as the original seats of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> have been occupied by a continuous succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the present day, especially when we are accustomed to see this happen in the case of ordinary writings both in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and out of it.</p>

<p>7. But Faustus finds contradictions in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. Say, rather, that Faustus reads the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> in a wrong spirit, that he is too foolish to understand, and too blind to see. If you were animated with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> instead of being misled by party spirit, you might easily, by examining these passages, discover a wonderful and most instructive harmony among the writers. Who, in reading two narratives of the same event, would think of charging one or both of the authors with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, because one omits what the other mentions, or one tells concisely, but with substantial  agreement, what the other relates in detail, so as to indicate not only what was done, but also how it was done? This is what Faustus does in his attempt to impeach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>; as if Luke's omitting some saying of Christ recorded in Matthew implied a denial on the part of Luke of Matthew's statement. There is no real difficulty in the case; and to make a difficulty shows want of thought, or of the ability to think. There is, indeed, a point in the narrative of the centurion which is discussed among <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and on which objections are raised by unbelievers of no great learning, who prove their quarrelsomeness, when, after being instructed, they do not give up their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. The point is, that Matthew says that the centurion came to Jesus "beseeching Him, and saying;" while Luke says that he sent to Jesus the elders of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> with this same request, that He would heal his servant who was sick; and that when He came near the house he sent others, through whom he said that he was not worthy that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> should come into his house, and that he was not worthy to come himself to Jesus. How, then, do we read in Matthew, "He came to Him, beseeching Him, and saying, My servant lies at home sick of the palsy, and grievously tormented?"  The explanation is, that Matthew's narrative is correct, but brief, mentioning the centurion's coming to Jesus, without saying whether he came himself or by others, or whether the words about his servant were spoken by himself or through others. But is it not common to speak of a person as coming near to a thing, although he may not reach it? And even the word <em>reach</em>, which is the strongest form of expression, is frequently used in cases where the person spoken of acts through others, as when we say he took his case to court, he reached the presence of the judge; or, again, he reached the presence of some man in power, although it may probably have been through his friends, and the person may not have seen him whose presence he is said to have reached. And from the word for <em>to reach</em> we give the name of Perventors to those who by ambitious arts gain access, either personally or through friends, to the, so to speak, inaccessible minds of the great. Are we, then, in reading to forget the common usage of speech? Or must the sacred Scripture have a language of its own? The cavils of forward critics are thus met by a reference to the usual forms of speech.</p>

<p>8. Those who examine this matter not in a disputatious but in a calm believing spirit are invited to come to Jesus, not outwardly but in heart, not in bodily presence but in the power of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as the centurion did, and then they will better understand Matthew's narrative. To such it is said in the Psalm "Come unto Him, and be enlightened; and your faces shall not be ashamed."  Hence we learn that the centurion, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was so highly spoken of, came to Christ more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> than the people who carried his message. We find an analogous case in the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with the issue of blood, who was healed by touching the hem of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> garment, when Christ said, "Some one has touched me." The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> wondered what Christ meant by saying, "Who has touched me?" "Some one has touched me," when the crowd was thronging Him. In fact, they made this reply: "The crowd throngs You, and sayest Thou, Who has touched me?" <span class="stiki" id="note141085"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;8:43,&nbsp;46</a></span> Now, as the people thronged Christ while the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> touched Him, so the messengers were sent to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but the centurion really came to Him. In Matthew we have a not infrequent form of expression, and at the same time a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> import; while in Luke there is a simple narrative of the whole event, such as to draw our attention to the manner in which Matthew has recorded it. I wish one of those people who found their silly objections to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> on such trifling difficulties would himself tell a story twice over, honestly giving a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> account of what happened, and that his words were written down and read over to him. We should then see whether he would not say more or less at one time than at another; and whether the order would not be changed, not only of words, but of things; and whether he would not put some opinion of his own into the mouth of another, because, though he never heard him say it, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it perfectly well to be in his mind; and whether he would not sometimes put in a few words what he had before related at length. In these and other ways, which might perhaps be reduced to rule, the narratives of the same thing by two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or two narratives by the same person, might differ in many things without being opposed, might be unlike without being contradictory. Thus are undone all the bandages with which poor <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> stifle themselves to keep in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and to keep out all that might lead to their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>9. Now that all Faustus' <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> have been refuted, those at least on the subjects here treated of at large and explained fully as the Lord has enabled me, I close with a word of counsel to you who are implicated in those shocking and damnable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, that, if you acknowledge the supreme authority of Scripture, you should recognise that authority which from the time of Christ Himself, through the ministry of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and through a regular succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the seats of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, has been preserved to our own day throughout the whole world, with a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all. There the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> too has its difficulties solved, and its predictions fulfilled. If you ask for demonstration, consider first what you are, how unfit for comprehending the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not to speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; I mean an intelligent comprehension, such as you profess to desire, or to have once desired, and not the notions of a credulous fancy. Admitting this incompetency, which must continue while you remain as you are, you may at least be referred to the natural conviction of every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, unless it is corrupted by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, of the perfect unchangeableness and incorruptibility of the nature and substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Admit this, or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it, and you will no longer be <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, so that in course of time you may become <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</p>
