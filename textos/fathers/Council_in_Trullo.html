<h1>Council in Trullo</h1>

<h2>Canon 1</h2>

<p>That order is best of all which makes every word and act begin and end in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore that <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> may be clearly set forth by us and that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of which Christ is the foundation may be continually increased and advanced, and that it may be exalted above the cedars of Lebanon; now therefore we, by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> at the beginning of our decrees, define that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> set forth by the God-chosen Apostles who themselves had both seen and were ministers of the Word, shall be preserved without any innovation, unchanged and inviolate.</p>

<p>Moreover the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the three hundred and eighteen <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed fathers who were assembled at Nice under Constantine our Emperor, against the impious <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and the gentile diversity of deity or rather (to speak accurately) multitude of gods taught by him, who by the unanimous acknowledgment of the faithful revealed and declared to us the consubstantiality of the Three Persons comprehended in the Divine Nature, not suffering this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to lie hidden under the bushel of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but openly teaching the faithful to adore with one worship the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, confuting and scattering to the winds the opinion of different grades, and demolishing and overturning the puerile toyings fabricated out of sand by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> against <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>.</p>

<p>Likewise also we confirm that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was set forth by the one hundred and fifty fathers who in the time of Theodosius the Elder, our Emperor, assembled in this imperial city, accepting their decisions with regard to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in assertion of his godhead, and expelling the profane Macedonius (together with all previous enemies of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>) as one who dared to judge Him to be a servant who is Lord, and who wished to divide, like a robber, the inseparable unity, so that there might be no perfect <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>And together with this odious and detestable contender against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we condemn <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the same iniquity, who impiously belched forth that the Lord assumed a body unendowed with a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  thence also inferring that his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> wrought for us was imperfect.</p>

<p>Moreover what things were set forth by the two hundred God-bearing fathers in the city of Ephesus in the days of Theodosius our Emperor, the son of Arcadius; these doctrines we assent to as the unbroken strength of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, teaching that Christ the incarnate <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is one; and declaring that she who bare him without <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed was the immaculate Ever-Virgin, glorifying her as literally and in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. We condemn as foreign to the divine scheme the absurd division of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, who teaches that the one Christ consists of a man separately and of the Godhead separately and renews the Jewish impiety.</p>

<p>Moreover we confirm that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which at Chalcedon, the Metropolis, was set forth in accordance with <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> by the six hundred and thirty God-approved fathers in the time of Marcian, who was our Emperor, which handed down with a great and mighty voice, even unto the ends of the earth, that the one Christ, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, is of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, and must be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>  in these two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, and which cast forth from the sacred precincts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a black pestilence to be avoided, Eutyches, babbling stupidly and inanely, and teaching that the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F30;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>) was perfected in thought only. And together with him also <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and Dioscorus of whom the former was the defender and champion of the division, the latter of the confusion [of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in the one Christ], both of whom fell away from the divergence of their impiety to a common depth of perdition and denial of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Also we recognize as inspired by the Spirit the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> voices of the one hundred and sixty-five God-bearing fathers who assembled in this imperial city in the time of our <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian</a> of blessed memory, and we teach them to those who come after us; for these synodically <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> and execrated <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> (the teacher of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>), and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and Didymus, and Evagrius, all of whom reintroduced feigned Greek myths, and brought back again the circlings of certain bodies and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and deranged turnings [or transmigrations] to the wanderings or dreamings of their minds, and impiously insulting the resurrection of the dead. Moreover [they condemned] what things were written by Theodoret against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> and against the Twelve Chapters of blessed Cyril, and that letter which is said to have been written by Ibas.</p>

<p>Also we agree to guard untouched the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Sixth Holy Synod, which first assembled in this imperial city in the time of Constantine, our Emperor, of blessed memory, which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> received still greater confirmation from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor ratified with his own signet that which was written for the security of future generations. This council taught that we should openly profess our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that in the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there are two natural wills or volitions and two natural operations; and condemned by a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> sentence those who adulterated the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine and taught the people that in the one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> there is but one will and one operation; to wit, Theodore of Pharan, Cyrus of Alexandria, Honorius of Rome, Sergius, Pyrrhus, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Peter, who were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this God-preserved city; Macarius, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; Stephen, who was his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and the insane Polychronius, depriving them henceforth from the communion of the body of Christ our God.</p>

<p>And, to say so once for all, we decree that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall stand firm and remain unsullied until the end of the world as well as the writings divinely handed down and the teachings of all those who have beautified and adorned the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> and were lights in the world, having embraced the word of life. And we reject and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those whom they rejected and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, as being enemies of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and as insane ragers against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as lifters up of iniquity.</p>

<p>But if any one at all shall not observe and embrace the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> decrees, and teach and preach in accordance therewith, but shall attempt to set himself in opposition thereto, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, according to the decree already promulgated by the approved <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Fathers, and let him be cast out and stricken off as an alien from the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. For our decrees add nothing to the things previously defined, nor do they take anything away, nor have we any such power.</p>

<h2>Canon 2</h2>

<p>It has also seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Council, that the eighty-five canons, received and ratified by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Fathers before us, and also handed down to us in the name of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Apostles should from this time forth remain firm and unshaken for the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and the healing of disorders. And in these canons we are bidden to receive the Constitutions of the Holy Apostles [written] by Clement. But formerly through the agency of those who erred from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> certain adulterous matter was introduced, clean contrary to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, for the polluting of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which obscures the elegance and beauty of the divine decrees in their present form. We therefore reject these Constitutions so as the better to make sure of the edification and security of the most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> flock; by no means admitting the offspring of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and cleaving to the pure and perfect doctrine of the Apostles. But we set our seal likewise upon all the other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> canons set forth by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Fathers, that is, by the 318 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> God-bearing Fathers assembled at Nice, and those at Ancyra, further those at Neoc&aelig;sarea and likewise those at Gangra, and besides, those at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>: those too at <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> in Phrygia: and likewise the 150 who assembled in this heaven-protected royal city: and the 200 who assembled the first time in the metropolis of the Ephesians, and the 630 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Fathers at Chalcedon. In like manner those of Sardica, and those of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>: those also who again assembled in this heaven-protected royal city under its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Nectarius and Theophilus Archbishop of Alexandria. Likewise too the Canons [i.e. the decretal letters] of Dionysius, formerly Archbishop of the great city of Alexandria; and of Peter, Archbishop of Alexandria and Martyr; of Gregory the Wonder-worker, Bishop of Neoc&aelig;sarea; of Athanasius, Archbishop of Alexandria; of Basil, Archbishop of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia; of Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa; of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Theologus</a>; of Amphilochius of Iconium; of Timothy, Archbishop of Alexandria; of Theophilus, Archbishop of the same great city of Alexandria; of Cyril, Archbishop of the same Alexandria; of Gennadius, Patriarch of this heaven-protected royal city. Moreover the Canon set forth by Cyprian, Archbishop of the country of the Africans and Martyr, and by the Synod under him, which has been kept only in the country of the aforesaid Bishops, according to the custom delivered down to them. And that no one be allowed to transgress or disregard the aforesaid canons, or to receive others beside them, supposititiously set forth by certain who have attempted to make a traffic of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But should any one be convicted of innovating upon, or attempting to overturn, any of the afore-mentioned canons, he shall be subject to receive the penalty which that canon imposes, and to be cured by it of his transgression.</p>

<h2>Canon 3</h2>

<p>Since our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Emperor has addressed this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical council, in order that it might provide for the purity of those who are in the list of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and who transmit divine things to others, and that they may be blameless ministrants, and worthy of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is both Offering and High Priest, a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> apprehended by the intelligence: and that it might cleanse away the pollutions wherewith these have been branded by unlawful marriages: now whereas they of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Roman Church purpose to keep the rule of exact perfection, but those who are under the throne of this heaven-protected and royal city keep that of kindness and consideration, so blending both together as our fathers have done, and as the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God requires, that neither gentleness fall into licence, nor severity into harshness; especially as the fault of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> has reached no small number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, we decree, that those who are involved in a second marriage, and have been slaves to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> up to the fifteenth of the past month of January, in the past fourth Indiction, the 6109th year, and have not resolved to repent of it, be subjected to canonical deposition: but that they who are involved in this disorder of a second marriage, but before our decree have acknowledged what is fitting, and have cut off their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and have put far from them this strange and illegitimate connection, or they whose wives by second marriage are already dead, or who have turned to repentance of their own accord, having learned continence, and having quickly forgotten their former iniquities, whether they be <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, these we have determined should cease from all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> ministrations or exercise, being under punishment for a certain time, but should retain the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of their seat and station, being satisfied with their seat before the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> and begging with tears from the Lord that the transgression of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> be pardoned them: for unfitting it were that he should bless another who has to tend his own wounds. But those who have been married to one wife, if she was a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and likewise those who after their ordination have unlawfully entered into one marriage that is, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and subdeacons, being debarred for some short time from sacred ministration, and censured, shall be restored again to their proper rank, never advancing to any further rank, their unlawful marriage being openly dissolved. This we decree to hold good only in the case of those that are involved in the aforesaid faults up to the fifteenth (as was said) of the month of January, of the fourth Indiction, decreeing from the present time, and renewing the Canon which declares, that he who has been joined in two marriages after his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or has had a concubine, cannot be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or at all on the sacerdotal list; in like manner, that he who has taken a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> person, or a harlot, or a servant, or an actress, cannot be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or at all on the sacerdotal list.</p>

<h2>Canon 4</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacon</a>, lector, cantor, or door-keeper has had intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, as one who has corrupted a spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 5</h2>

<p>Let none of those who are on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> list possess any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> or maid servant, beyond those who are enumerated in the canon as being <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> free from suspicion, preserving himself hereby from being implicated in any blame. But if anyone transgresses our decree let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>. And let eunuchs also observe the same rule, that by foresight they may be free of censure. But those who transgress, let them be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, if indeed they are <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; but if <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> let them be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 6</h2>

<p>Since it is declared in the apostolic canons that of those who are advanced to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> unmarried, only lectors and <a href="../cathen/03306a.htm">cantors</a> are able to marry; we also, maintaining this, determine that henceforth it is in nowise lawful for any <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> after his ordination to contract matrimony but if he shall have dared to do so, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>. And if any of those who enter the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, wishes to be joined to a wife in lawful marriage before he is ordained <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, let it be done.</p>

<h2>Canon 7</h2>

<p>Since we have learned that in some churches <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> hold <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices, and that hereby some of them with arrogancy and license sit daringly before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>: we have determined that a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, even if in an office of dignity, that is to say, in whatever <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office he may be, is not to have his seat before a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, except he is acting as representative of his own patriarch or metropolitan in another city under another superior, for then he shall be honoured as filling his place. But if anyone, possessed with a tyrannical audacity, shall have dared to do such a thing, let him be ejected from his peculiar rank and be last of all of the order in whose list he is in his own church; our Lord admonishing us that we are not to delight in taking the chief seats, according to the doctrine which is found in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Evangelist Luke, as put forth by our Lord and God himself. For to those who were called he taught this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>: <q>When you are bidden by anyone to a marriage sit not down in the highest room lest a more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> man than you shall have been bidden by him; and he who bade you and him come and say to you: Give this man place, and you begin with shame to take the lowest room. But when you are bidden, sit down in the lowest place, so that when he who bade you comes he may say to you, Friend go up higher: then you shall have worship in the presence of them that sit with you. For whosoever exalts himself shall be abased, and he that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself shall be exalted.</q> But the same thing also shall be observed in the remaining sacred orders; seeing that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that spiritual things are to be preferred to worldly dignity.</p>

<h2>Canon 8</h2>

<p>Since we desire that in every point the things which have been decreed by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers may also be established and confirmed, we hereby renew the canon which orders that synods of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of each province be held every year where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the metropolis shall deem best. But since on account of the incursions of barbarians and certain other incidental causes, those who preside over the churches cannot hold synods twice a year, it seems right that by all means once a year&mdash; on account of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> questions which are likely to arise&mdash; a synod of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be holden in every province, between the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and October, as has been said above, in the place which the Metropolitan shall have deemed most fitting. And let such <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as do not attend, when they are at home in their own cities and are in good health, and free from all unavoidable and necessary business, be fraternally reproved.</p>

<h2>Canon 9</h2>

<p>Let no <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> be permitted to keep a <q>public house.</q> For if it be not permitted to enter a tavern, much more is it forbidden to serve others in it and to carry on a trade which is unlawful for him. But if he shall have done any such thing, either let him desist or be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 10</h2>

<p>A <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a></span>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who receives <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, or what is called <em>hecatost&aelig;</em>, let him desist or be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 11</h2>

<p>Let no one in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order nor any <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> eat the unleavened bread of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nor have any familiar intercourse with them, nor summon them in illness, nor receive medicines from them, nor bathe with them; but if anyone shall take in hand to do so, if he is a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, but if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 12</h2>

<p>Moreover this also has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that in Africa and Libya and in other places the most God-beloved <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in those parts do not refuse to live with their wives, even after consecration, thereby giving scandal and offense to the people. Since, therefore, it is our particular care that all things tend to the good of the flock placed in our hands and committed to us&mdash;it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that henceforth nothing of the kind shall in any way occur. And we say this, not to abolish and overthrow what things were established of old by Apostolic authority, but as caring for the health of the people and their advance to better things, and lest the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> state should suffer any reproach. For the divine Apostle says: <q>Do all to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, give none offense, neither to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nor to the Greeks, nor to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, even as I please all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in all things, not seeking my own profit but the profit of many, that they may be saved. Be imitators of me even as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> But if any shall have been observed to do such a thing, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 13</h2>

<p>Since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it to be handed down as a rule of the Roman Church that those who are deemed worthy to be advanced to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> or <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbyterate</a> should promise no longer to cohabit with their wives, we, preserving the ancient rule and apostolic perfection and order, will that the lawful marriages of men who are in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders be from this time forward firm, by no means dissolving their union with their wives nor depriving them of their mutual intercourse at a convenient time. Wherefore, if anyone shall have been found worthy to be ordained <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, he is by no means to be prohibited from admittance to such a rank, even if he shall live with a lawful wife. Nor shall it be demanded of him at the time of his ordination that he promise to abstain from lawful intercourse with his wife: lest we should affect injuriously marriage constituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and blessed by his presence, as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says: <q>What God has joined together let no man put asunder;</q> and the Apostle says, <q>Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and the bed undefiled;</q> and again, <q>Are you bound to a wife? Seek not to be loosed.</q> But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, as they who assembled at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> (with a care for the honest life of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>) said, that subdeacons, who handle the Holy Mysteries, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> should abstain from their consorts according to their own course [of ministration]. So that what has been handed down through the Apostles and preserved by ancient custom, we too likewise maintain, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that there is a time for all things and especially for <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For it is meet that they who assist at the divine altar should be absolutely continent when they are handling <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, in order that they may be able to obtain from God what they ask in sincerity.</p>

<p>If therefore anyone shall have dared, contrary to the Apostolic Canons, to deprive any of those who are in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> of cohabitation and intercourse with his lawful wife, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>. In like manner also if any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> on pretence of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> has dismissed his wife, let him be excluded from communion; and if he persevere in this let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 14</h2>

<p>Let the canon of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> God-bearing Fathers be confirmed in this particular also; that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> be not ordained before he is thirty years of age, even if he be a very worthy man, but let him be kept back. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and began to teach when he was thirty. In like manner let no <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> be ordained before he is twenty-five, nor a <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> before she is forty.</p>

<h2>Canon 15</h2>

<p>A <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a></span> is not to be ordained under twenty years of age. And if any one in any grade of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> shall have been ordained contrary to the prescribed time let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 16</h2>

<p>Since the book of the Acts tells us that seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were appointed by the Apostles, and the synod of Neoc&aelig;sarea in the canons which it put forth determined that there ought to be canonically only seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, even if the city be very large, in accordance with the book of the Acts; we, having fitted the mind of the fathers to the Apostles' words, find that they spoke not of those men who ministered at the Mysteries but in the administration which pertains to the serving of tables. For the book of the Acts reads as follows: <q>In those days, when the number of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> was multiplied, there arose a murmuring dissension of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> were neglected in the daily ministrations. And the Twelve called the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with them and said, It is not meet for us to leave the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and serve tables. Look out therefore, brethren, from among you seven men of good report full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. But we will give ourselves continually unto <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and unto the ministry of the word. And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen a man full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselyte</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>: whom they set before the Apostles.</q></p>

<p>John Chrysostom, a <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a>, interpreting these words, proceeds thus: <q>It is a remarkable fact that the multitude was not divided in its choice of the men, and that the Apostles were not rejected by them. But we must learn what sort of rank they had, and what ordination they received. Was it that of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>? But this office did not yet exist in the churches. But was it the dispensation of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>? But there was not as yet any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but only Apostles, whence I think it is clear and manifest that neither of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> nor of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> was there then the name.</q> </p>

<p>But on this account therefore we also announce that the aforesaid seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> are not to be understood as <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> who served at the Mysteries, according to the teaching before set forth, but that they were those to whom a dispensation was entrusted for the common benefit of those that were gathered together, who to us in this also were a type of philanthropy and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> towards those who are in need.</p>

<h2>Canon 17</h2>

<p>Since <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of different churches have left their own churches in which they were ordained and betaken themselves to other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and without the consent of their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> have been settled in other churches, and thus they have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> themselves to be insolent and disobedient; we decree that from the month of January of the past IVth Indiction no <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, of whatsoever grade he be, shall have power, without letters dimissory of his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to be registered in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> list of another church. Whoever in future shall not have observed this rule, but shall have brought disgrace upon himself as well as on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who ordained him, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> together with him who also received him.</p>

<h2>Canon 18</h2>

<p>Those <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who in consequence of a barbaric incursion or on account of any other circumstance have gone abroad, we order to return again to their churches after the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> has passed away, or when the incursion of the barbarians is at an end. Nor are they to leave them for long without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. If anyone shall not have returned according to the direction of this present canon&mdash; let him be cut off until he shall return to his own church. And the same shall be the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who received him.</p>

<h2>Canon 19</h2>

<p>It behooves those who preside over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, every day but especially on Lord's days, to teach all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people words of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and of right religion, gathering out of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture meditations and determinations of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and not going beyond the limits now fixed, nor varying from the tradition of the God-bearing fathers. And if any controversy in regard to Scripture shall have been raised, let them not interpret it otherwise than as the lights and doctors of the church in their writings have expounded it, and in those let them <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> rather than in composing things out of their own heads, lest through their lack of skill  they may have departed from what was fitting. For through the doctrine of the aforesaid fathers, the people coming to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and desirable, as well as what is useless and to be rejected, will remodel their life for the better, and not be led by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but applying their minds to the doctrine, they will take heed that no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> befall them and work out their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of impending punishment.</p>

<h2>Canon 20</h2>

<p>It shall not be lawful for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to teach publicly in any city which does not belong to him. If any shall have been observed doing this, let him cease from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, but let him discharge the office of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 21</h2>

<p>Those who have become guilty of crimes against the canons, and on this account subject to complete and perpetual deposition, are degraded to the condition of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. If, however, keeping conversion continually before their eyes, they willingly deplore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on account of which they fell from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and made themselves aliens therefrom, they may still cut their hair after the manner of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. But if they are not willing to submit themselves to this canon, they must wear their hair as <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, as being those who have preferred the communion of the world to the celestial life.</p>

<h2>Canon 22</h2>

<p>Those who are ordained for money, whether <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or of any rank whatever, and not by examination and choice of life, we order to be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> as well as those also who ordained them.</p>

<h2>Canon 23</h2>

<p>That no one, whether <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, when giving the immaculate Communion, shall exact from him who communicates fees of any kind. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not to be sold, nor do we give the sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> for money; but to those who are worthy of the gift it is to be communicated in all simplicity. But if any of those enrolled among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> make demands on those he communicates let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, as an imitator of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of Simon.</p>

<h2>Canon 24</h2>

<p>No one who is on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> catalogue nor any <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is allowed to take part in horse-races or to assist at theatrical representations. But if any <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> be called to a marriage, as soon as the games begin let him rise up and go out, for so it is ordered by the doctrine of our fathers. And if any one shall be convicted of such an offense let him cease therefrom or be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 25</h2>

<p>Moreover we renew the canon which orders that country (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03B3;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F70;&#x03C2;</span>) parishes and those which are in the provinces (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03C7;&#x03C9;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C2;</span>) shall remain subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had possession of them; especially if for thirty years they had administered them without opposition. But if within thirty years there had been or should be any controversy on the point, it is lawful for those who think themselves injured to refer the matter to the provincial synod.</p>

<h2>Canon 26</h2>

<p>If a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> has through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> contracted an illegal marriage, while he still retains the right to his place, as we have defined in the sacred canons, yet he must abstain from all sacerdotal work. For it is sufficient if to such an one indulgence is granted. For he is unfit to bless another who needs to take care of his own wounds, for blessing is the imparting of sanctification. But how can he impart this to another who does not possess it himself through a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>? Neither then in public nor in private can he bless nor distribute to others the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, [nor perform any other ministry]; but being content with his seat of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> let him lament to the Lord that his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> may be remitted. For it is manifest that the nefarious marriage must be dissolved, neither can the man have any intercourse with her on account of whom he is deprived of the execution of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 27</h2>

<p>None of those who are in the catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> shall wear clothes unsuited to them, either while still living in town or when on a journey: but they shall wear such clothes as are assigned to those who belong to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. And if any one shall violate this canon, he shall be cut off for one week.</p>

<h2>Canon 28</h2>

<p>Since we understand that in several churches grapes are brought to the altar, according to a custom which has long prevailed, and the ministers joined this with the unbloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the oblation, and distributed both to the people at the same time, we decree that no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall do this for the future, but shall administer the oblation alone to the people for the quickening of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and for the remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But with regard to the offering of grapes as first fruits, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> may bless them apart [from the offering of the oblation] and distribute them to such as seek them as an act of thanksgiving to him who is the Giver of the fruits by which our bodies are increased and fed according to his divine decree. And if any <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> shall violate this decree let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 29</h2>

<p>A canon of the Synod of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the altar are not to be performed but by men who are <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, except on one day in the year on which the Supper of the Lord is celebrated. At that time, on account perhaps of certain occasions in those places useful to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers themselves made use of this dispensation. But since nothing leads us to abandon exact observance, we decree that the Apostolic and Patristic tradition shall be followed; and define that it is not right to break the fast on the fifth feria of the last week of Lent, and thus to do dishonour to the whole of Lent.</p>

<h2>Canon 30</h2>

<p>Willing to do all things for the edification of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we have determined to take care even of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are in barbarian churches. Wherefore if they think that they ought to exceed the Apostolic Canon concerning the not putting away of a wife on the pretext of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and religion, and to do beyond that which is commanded, and therefore abstain by agreement with their wives from cohabitation, we decree they ought no longer to live with them in any way, so that hereby they may afford us a perfect demonstration of their promise. But we have conceded this to them on no other ground than their narrowness, and foreign and unsettled manners.</p>

<h2>Canon 31</h2>

<p>Clerics who in <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> which are in houses offer the Holy Mysteries or <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, we decree ought to do this with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place. Wherefore if any <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> shall not have so done, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 32</h2>

<p>Since it has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that in the region of Armenia they offer wine only on the Holy Table, those who celebrate the unbloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> not mixing water with it, adducing, as authority thereof, John Chrysostom, a doctor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who says in his interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to St. Matthew:</p>

<p><q>And wherefore did he not drink water after he was risen again, but wine? To pluck up by the roots another <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. For since there are certain who use water in the Mysteries to show that both when he delivered the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> he had given wine and that when he had risen and was setting before them a mere meal without mysteries,  he used wine, 'of the fruit,' says he, 'of the vine.' But a vine produces wine, not water.</q>  And from this they think the doctor overthrows the admixture of water in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. Now, lest on the point from this time forward they be held in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, we open out the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> opinion of the Father. For since there was an ancient and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Hydroparastat&aelig; (i.e., of those who offered water), who instead of wine used water in their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, this divine, confuting the detestable teaching of such a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and showing that it is directly opposed to Apostolic tradition, asserted that which has just been quoted. For to his own church, where the pastoral administration had been given him, he ordered that water mixed with wine should be used at the unbloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, so as to show forth the mingling of the blood and water which for the life of the whole world and for the redemption of its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, was poured forth from the precious side of Christ our Redeemer; and moreover in every church where spiritual light has shined this divinely given order is observed.</p>

<p>For also James, the brother, according to the flesh, of Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom the throne of the church of Jerusalem first was entrusted, and Basil, the Archbishop of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of C&aelig;sarea, whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> has spread through all the world, when they delivered to us directions for the mystical <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> in writing, declared that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> chalice is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the Divine Liturgy with water and wine. And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers who assembled at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> provided in these express terms: <q>That in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Mysteries nothing besides the body and blood of the Lord be offered, as the Lord himself laid down, that is bread and wine mixed with water.</q> Therefore if any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> shall not perform the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> action according to what has been handed down by the Apostles, and shall not offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> with wine mixed with water, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, as imperfectly showing forth the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> and innovating on the things which have been handed down.</p>

<h2>Canon 33</h2>

<p>Since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, in the region of the Armenians, only those are appointed to the clerical orders who are of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> descent (following in this Jewish customs); and some of those who are even untonsured are appointed to succeed <a href="../cathen/03306a.htm">cantors</a> and readers of the divine law, we decree that henceforth it shall not be lawful for those who wish to bring any one into the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, to pay regard to the descent of him who is to be ordained; but let them examine whether they are worthy (according to the decrees set forth in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> canons) to be placed on the list of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, so that they may be ecclesiastically promoted, whether they are of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> descent or not; moreover, let them not permit any one at all to read in the <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a>, according to the order of those enrolled in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, unless such an one have received the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and the canonical benediction of his own pastor; but if any one shall have been observed to act contrary to these directions, let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 34</h2>

<p>But in future, since the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> canon openly sets this forth, that the crime of conspiracy or secret society is forbidden by external <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, but much more ought it to be prohibited in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; we also hasten to observe that if any <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> are found either conspiring or entering secret societies, or devising anything against <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or clergymen, they shall be altogether deprived of their rank.</p>

<h2>Canon 35</h2>

<p>It shall be lawful for no Metropolitan on the death of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his province to appropriate or sell the private property of the deceased, or that of the widowed church: but these are to be in the custody of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the diocese over which he presided until the election of another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, unless in the said church there are no clergymen left. For then the Metropolitan shall protect the property without diminution, handing over everything to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> when he is appointed.</p>

<h2>Canon 36</h2>

<p>Renewing the enactments by the 150 Fathers assembled at the God-protected and imperial city, and those of the 630 who met at Chalcedon; we decree that the see of Constantinople shall have equal privileges with the see of Old Rome, and shall be highly regarded in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters as that is, and shall be second after it. After Constantinople shall be ranked the See of Alexandria, then that of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and afterwards the See of Jerusalem.</p>

<h2>Canon 37</h2>

<p>Since at different times there have been invasions of barbarians, and therefore very many cities have been subjected to the infidels, so that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a city may not be able, after he has been ordained, to take possession of his see, and to be settled in it in sacerdotal order, and so to perform and manage for it the ordinations and all things which by custom appertain to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>: we, preserving <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and veneration for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and in no wise wishing to employ the Gentile injury to the ruin of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rights, have decreed that those who have been ordained thus, and on account of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> have not been settled in their sees, without any prejudice from this thing may be kept [in good standing] and that they may canonically perform the ordination of the different <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and use the authority of their office according to the defined limits, and that whatever administration proceeds from them may be valid and legitimate. For the exercise of his office shall not be circumscribed by a season of necessity when the exact observance of law is circumscribed.</p>

<h2>Canon 38</h2>

<p>The canon which was made by the Fathers we also observe, which thus decreed: If any city be renewed by imperial authority, or shall have been renewed, let the order of things <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> follow the civil and public models.</p>

<h2>Canon 39</h2>

<p>Since our brother and fellow-worker, John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the island of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, together with his people in the province of the Hellespont, both on account of barbarian incursions, and that they may be freed from servitude of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and may be subject alone to the sceptres of most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rule, have emigrated from the said island, by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of the philanthropic <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the labour of our Christ-loving and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Empress; we determine that the privileges which were conceded by the divine fathers who first at Ephesus assembled, are to be preserved without any innovations, viz.: that new <a href="../cathen/08580b.htm">Justinianopolis</a> shall have the rights of Constantinople and whoever is constituted the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and most religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> thereof shall take precedence of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of the Hellespont, and be elected [?] by his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> according to ancient custom. For the customs which obtain in each church our divine Fathers also took pains should be maintained, the existing <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a> being subject to the metropolitan of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/08580b.htm">Justinianopolis</a>, for the imitation of all the rest of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are under the aforesaid beloved of God metropolitan John, by whom, as custom demands, even the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the very city of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a> shall be ordained.</p>

<h2>Canon 40</h2>

<p>Since to cleave to God by retiring from the noise and turmoil of life is very beneficial, it behooves us not without examination to admit before the proper time those who choose the monastic life, but to observe respecting them the limit handed down by our fathers, in order that we may then admit a profession of the life according to God as for ever firm, and the result of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and judgment after years of discretion have been reached. He therefore who is about to submit to the yoke of monastic life should not be less than ten years of age, the examination of the matter depending on the decision of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whether he considers a longer time more conducive for his entrance and establishment in the monastic life. For although the great Basil in his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> canons decreed that she who willingly offers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and embraces <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, if she has completed her seventeenth year, is to be entered in the order of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>: nevertheless, having followed the example respecting <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, analogy and proportion being considered, we have admitted at the said time those who have chosen the monastic life. For it is written in the divine Apostle that a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> is to be elected in the church at sixty years old: but the sacred canons have decreed that a <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> shall be ordained at forty, since they saw that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> had gone forth more powerful and robust and was advancing still further, and they saw the firmness and stability of the faithful in observing the divine commandments. Wherefore we also, since we most rightly comprehend the matter, appoint the benediction of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to him who is about to enter the struggle according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as impressing speedily a certain seal upon him, hereupon introducing him to the not-long-to-be-hesitated-over and declined, or rather inciting him even to the choice and determination of good.</p>

<h2>Canon 41</h2>

<p>Those who in town or in villages wish to go away into cloisters, and take heed for themselves apart, before they enter a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and practise the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite's</a> life,  should for the space of three years in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God submit to the Superior of the house, and fulfil <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> in all things, as is right, thus showing forth their choice of this life and that they embrace it willingly and with their whole hearts; they are then to be examined by the superior (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x1F73;&#x03B4;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) of the place; and then to bear bravely outside the cloister one year more, so that their purpose may be fully manifested. For by this they will show fully and perfectly that they are not catching at vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but that they are pursuing the life of solitude because of its inherent beauty and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. After the completion of such a period, if they remain in the same intention in their choice of the life, they are to be enclosed, and no longer is it lawful for them to go out of such a house when they so desire, unless they be induced to do so for the common advantage, or other pressing necessity urging on to death; and then only with the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that place.</p>

<p>And those who, without the above-mentioned causes, venture forth of their convents, are first of all to be shut up in the said convent even against their wills, and then are to cure themselves with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and other afflictions, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how it is written that <q>no one who has put his hand to the plough and has looked back, is fit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Canon 42</h2>

<p>Those who are called Eremites and are clothed in black robes, and with long hair go about cities and associate with the worldly both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and bring odium upon their profession&mdash; we decree that if they will receive the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and wear their hair cut short, they may be shut up in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and numbered among the brothers; but if they do not choose to do this, they are to be expelled from the cities and forced to live in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C1;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C2;</span>) from whence also they derive their name.</p>

<h2>Canon 43</h2>

<p>It is lawful for every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to choose the life of religious discipline, and setting aside the troublous surgings of the affairs of this life to enter a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and to be shaven in the fashion of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, without regard to what faults he may have previously committed. For God our Saviour says: <q>Whose comes to me, I will in no wise cast out.</q></p>

<p>As therefore the monastic method of life engraves upon us as on a tablet the life of penitence, we receive  whoever approaches it  sincerely; nor is any custom to be allowed to hinder him from fulfilling his intention.</p>

<h2>Canon 44</h2>

<p>A <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a></span> convicted of fornication, or who takes a wife for the communion of matrimony and for society, is to be subjected to the penalties of fornicators, according to the canons.</p>

<h2>Canon 45</h2>

<p>Whereas we understand that in some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> those who are about to be clothed with the sacred habit are first adorned in silks and garments of all kinds, and also with gold and jewels, by those who bring them there, and that they thus approach the altar and are there stripped of such a display of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and that immediately thereafter the blessing of their habit takes place, and they are clothed with the black robe; we decree that henceforth this shall not be done. For it is not lawful for her who has already of her own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> put away every delight of life, and has embraced that method of life which is according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and has confirmed it with strong and stable reasons, and so has come to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, to recall to memory the things which they had already forgotten, things of this world which perishes and passes away. For thus they raise in themselves doubts, and are disturbed in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, like the tossing waves, turning hither and there. Moreover, they should not give bodily evidence of heaviness of heart by weeping, but if a few tears drop from their eyes, as is like enough to be the case, they may be supposed by those who see them to have flowed <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x1F74; &#x03BC;&#x1FB6;&#x03BB;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> on account of their affection (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>, affectionem) for the <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> struggle rather than (<span class="greek">&#x1F22;</span>) because they are quitting the world and worldly things.</p>

<h2>Canon 46</h2>

<p>Those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who choose the <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> life and are settled in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> may by no means go forth of them. If, however, any inexorable necessity compels them, let them do so with the blessing and permission of her who is mother superior; and even then they must not go forth alone, but with some old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who are eminent in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and at the command of the lady superior. But it is not at all permitted that they should stop outside.</p>

<p>And men also who follow the monastic life let them on urgent necessity go forth with the blessing of him to whom the rule is entrusted.</p>

<p>Wherefore, those who transgress that which is now decreed by us, whether they be men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, are to be subjected to suitable punishments.</p>

<h2>Canon 47</h2>

<p>No <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> may sleep in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, nor any man in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. For it behooves the faithful to be without offense and to give no scandal, and to order their lives decorously and honestly and acceptably to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if any one shall have done this, whether he be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 48</h2>

<p>The wife of him who is advanced to the Episcopal dignity, shall be separated from her husband by their mutual consent, and after his ordination and consecration to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> she shall enter a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> situated at a distance from the abode of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and there let her enjoy the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> provision. And if she is deemed worthy she may be advanced to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 49</h2>

<p>Renewing also the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> canon, we decree that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which have been once <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the Episcopal will, are always to remain <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the things which belong to them are to be preserved to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and they cannot any more be secular abodes nor be given by any one to seculars. But if anything of this kind has been done already, we declare it to be null; and those who hereafter attempt to do so are to be subjected to canonical penalties.</p>

<h2>Canon 50</h2>

<p>No one at all, whether <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, is from this time forward to play at dice. And if any one hereafter shall be found doing so, if he be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> he is to be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 51</h2>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical synod altogether forbids those who are called <q>players,</q> and their <q>spectacles,</q> as well as the exhibition of hunts, and the theatrical dances. If any one despises the present canon, and gives himself to any of the things which are forbidden, if he be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> he shall be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, but if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 52</h2>

<p>On all days of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fast of Lent, except on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, the Lord's day and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day of the Annunciation, the Liturgy of the Presanctified is to be said.</p>

<h2>Canon 53</h2>

<p>Whereas the spiritual relationship is greater than fleshly affinity; and since it has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that in some places certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who become sponsors to children in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> salvation-bearing <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, afterwards contract matrimony with their mothers (being <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>), we decree that for the future nothing of this sort is to be done. But if any, after the present canon, shall be observed to do this, they must, in the first place, desist from this unlawful marriage, and then be subjected to the penalties of fornicators.</p>

<h2>Canon 54</h2>

<p>The divine scriptures plainly teach us as follows, <q>You shall not approach to any that is near of kin to you to uncover their nakedness.</q> Basil, the bearer-of-<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has enumerated in his canons some marriages which are prohibited and has passed over the greater part in silence, and in both these ways has done us good service. For by avoiding a number of disgraceful names (lest by such words he should pollute his discourse) he included impurities under general terms, by which course he showed to us in a general way the marriages which are forbidden. But since by such silence, and because of the difficulty of understanding what marriages are prohibited, the matter has become confused; it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to us to set it forth a little more clearly, decreeing that from this time forth he who shall marry the daughter of his father's brother; or a father or son with a mother and daughter; or a father and son with two girls who are sisters; or a mother and daughter with two brothers; or two brothers with two sisters, fall under the canon of seven years, provided they openly separate from this unlawful union.</p>

<h2>Canon 55</h2>

<p>Since we understand that in the city of the Romans, in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fast of Lent they fast on the Saturdays, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> observance which is traditional, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod that also in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Romans the canon shall immovably stands fast which says: <q>If any <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> shall be found to fast on a Sunday or Saturday (except on one occasion only) he is to be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; and if he is a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> he shall be cut off.</q></p>

<h2>Canon 56</h2>

<p>We have likewise learned that in the regions of Armenia and in other places certain people eat eggs and cheese on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> and Lord's days of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> lent. It seems good therefore that the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of God which is in all the world should follow one rule and keep the fast perfectly, and as they abstain from everything which is killed, so also should they from eggs and cheese, which are the fruit and produce of those animals from which we abstain. But if any shall not observe this law, if they be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, let them be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; but if <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, let them be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 57</h2>

<p>It is not right to offer honey and milk on the altar.</p>

<h2>Canon 58</h2>

<p>None of those who are in the order of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> may distribute the Divine Mysteries to himself if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> be present. But whoso shall dare to do such a thing, as acting contrary to what has been determined shall be cut off for a week and thenceforth let him learn not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think.</p>

<h2>Canon 59</h2>

<p>Baptism is by no means to be administered in an oratory which is within a house; but they who are about to be held worthy of the spotless illumination are to go to a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and there to enjoy this gift. But if any one shall be convicted of not observing what we have determined, if he be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 60</h2>

<p>Since the Apostle exclaims that he who cleaves to the Lord is one spirit, it is clear that he who is intimate with his [i.e. the Lord's] enemy becomes one by his affinity with him. Therefore, those who pretend they are possessed by a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and by their depravity of manners feign to manifest their form and appearance; it seems good by all means that they should be punished and that they should be subjected to afflictions and hardships of the same kind as those to which they who are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> demoniacally possessed are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> subjected with the intent of delivering them from the [work or rather] energy of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 61</h2>

<p>Those who give themselves up to soothsayers or to those who are called hecatontarchs or to any such, in order that they may learn from them what things  they wish to have revealed to them, let all such, according to the decrees lately made by the Fathers concerning them, be subjected to the canon of six years. And to this [penalty] they also should be subjected who carry about  she-bears or animals of the kind for the diversion and injury of the simple; as well as those who tell fortunes and fates, and genealogy, and a multitude of words of this kind from the nonsense of deceit and imposture. Also those who are called expellers of clouds, enchanters, amulet-givers, and soothsayers.</p>

<h2>Canon 62</h2>

<p>The so-called Calends, and what are called Bota and Brumalia, and the full assembly which takes place on the first of March, we wish to be abolished from the life of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. And also the public dances of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, which may do much harm and mischief. Moreover we drive away from the life of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the dances given in the names of those <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> called gods by the Greeks whether of men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and which are performed after an ancient and un-<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> fashion; decreeing that no man from this time forth shall be dressed as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, nor any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the garb suitable to men. Nor shall he assume comic, satyric, or tragic masks; nor may men invoke the name of the execrable Bacchus when they squeeze out the wine in the presses; nor when pouring out wine into jars [to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a laugh ], practising in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and vanity the things which proceed from the deceit of insanity. Therefore those who in the future attempt any of these things which are written, having obtained a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them, if they be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> we order them to be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, and if <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> to be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 63</h2>

<p>We forbid to be publicly read in Church, histories of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> which have been <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> put together by the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in order to dishonour the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Christ and induce unbelief among those who hear them, but we order that such books be given to the flames. But those who accept them or apply their mind to them as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 64</h2>

<p>It does not befit a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> to dispute or teach publicly, thus claiming for himself authority to teach, but he should yield to the order appointed by the Lord, and to open his ears to those who have received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to teach, and be taught by them divine things; for in one Church God has made <q>different members,</q> according to the word of the Apostle: and <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory the Theologian</a>, wisely interpreting this passage, commends the order in vogue with them saying:  <q>This order brethren we revere, this we guard. Let this one be the ear; that one the tongue, the hand or any other member. Let this one teach, but let that one learn.</q> And a little further on: <q>Learning in docility and abounding in cheerfulness, and ministering with alacrity, we shall not all be the tongue which is the more active member, not all of us Apostles, not all <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, nor shall we all interpret.</q> And again: <q>Why do you make yourself a shepherd when you are a sheep? Why become the head when you are a foot? Why do you try to be a commander when you are enrolled in the number of the soldiers?</q> And elsewhere: <q>Wisdom orders, Be not swift in words; nor compare yourself with the rich, being poor; nor seek to be wiser than the wise.</q> But if any one be found weakening the present canon, he is to be cut off for forty days.</p>

<h2>Canon 65</h2>

<p>The fires which are lighted on the new moons by some before their shops and houses, upon which (according to a certain ancient custom) they are wont foolishly and crazily to leap, we order henceforth to cease. Therefore, whosoever shall do such a thing, if he be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; but if he be a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, let him be cut off. For it is written in the <a href="../bible/2ki000.htm">Fourth Book of the Kings</a> <q>And Manasses built an altar to the whole <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">host</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, in the two courts of the Lord, and made his sons to pass through the fire, he used lots and augurs and divinations by birds and made ventriloquists [or pythons ] and multiplied <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, that he might do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the Lord and provoke him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Canon 66</h2>

<p>From the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day of the Resurrection of Christ our God until the next Lord's day, for a whole week, in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches the faithful ought to be free from labour, rejoicing in Christ with psalms and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and spiritual songs; and celebrating the feast, and applying their minds to the reading of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, and delighting in the Holy Mysteries; for thus shall we be exalted with Christ and together with him be raised up. Therefore, on the aforesaid days there must not be any horse races or any public spectacle.</p>

<h2>Canon 67</h2>

<p>The <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> commands us to abstain from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication. Those therefore who on account of a dainty stomach prepare by any art for food the blood of any animal, and so eat it, we punish suitably. If anyone henceforth venture to eat in any way the blood of an animal, if he be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 68</h2>

<p>It is unlawful for anyone to corrupt or cut up a book of the Old or <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> or of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and approved preachers and teachers, or to give them up to the traders in books or to those who are called perfumers, or to hand it over for destruction to any other like <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: unless to be sure it has been rendered useless either by bookworms, or by water, or in some other way. He who henceforth shall be observed to do such a thing shall be cut off for one year. Likewise also he who buys such books (unless he keeps them for his own use, or gives them to another for his benefit to be preserved) and has attempted to corrupt them, let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 69</h2>

<p>It is not permitted to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> to enter the sanctuary (Holy Altar, Gk.), though, in accordance with a certain ancient tradition, the imperial power and authority is by no means prohibited from this when he wishes to offer his gifts to the Creator.</p>

<h2>Canon 70</h2>

<p>Women are not permitted to speak at the time of the Divine Liturgy; but, according to the word of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Apostle, <q>let them be silent. For it is not permitted to them to speak, but to be in subjection, as the law also says. But if they wish to learn anything let them ask their own husbands at home.</q></p>

<h2>Canon 71</h2>

<p>Those who are taught the civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> must not adopt the customs of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, nor be induced to go to the theatre, nor to keep what are called <em>Cylestras</em>, nor to wear clothing contrary to the general custom; and this holds good when they begin their training, when they reach its end, and, in short, all the time of its duration. If any one from this time shall dare to do contrary to this canon he is to be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 72</h2>

<p>An <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> man is not permitted to marry an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, nor an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to be joined to an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> man. But if anything of this kind appear to have been done by any [we require them] to consider the marriage null, and that the marriage be dissolved. For it is not fitting to mingle together what should not be mingled, nor is it right that the sheep be joined with the wolf, nor the lot of sinners with the portion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But if any one shall transgress the things which we have decreed let him be cut off. But if any who up to this time are unbelievers and are not yet numbered in the flock of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> have contracted lawful marriage between themselves, and if then, one choosing the right and coming to the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the other remaining still detained by the bond of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and not willing to behold with steady eye the divine rays, the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is pleased to cohabit with the believing man, or the unbelieving man with the believing <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, let them not be separated, according to the divine Apostle, <q>for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife by her husband.</q></p>

<h2>Canon 73</h2>

<p>Since the life-giving cross has shown to us Salvation, we should be careful that we render due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to that by which we were saved from the ancient fall. Wherefore, in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in word, in feeling giving veneration (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x1F7B;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>) to it, we command that the figure of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, which some have placed on the floor, be entirely removed therefrom, lest the trophy of the victory won for us be desecrated by the trampling under foot of those who walk over it. Therefore those who from this present represent on the pavement the sign of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, we decree are to be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 74</h2>

<p>It is not permitted to hold what are called Agap&aelig;, that is <a href="../cathen/01200b.htm">love-feasts</a>, in the Lord's houses or churches, nor to eat within the house, nor to spread couches. If any dare to do so let him cease therefrom or be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 75</h2>

<p>We will that those whose office it is to sing in the churches do not use undisciplined vociferations, nor force nature to shouting, nor adopt any of those modes which are incongruous and unsuitable for the church: but that they offer the psalmody to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the observer of secrets, with great attention and compunction. For the Sacred Oracle taught that the Sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were to be <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>. </p>

<h2>Canon 76</h2>

<p>It is not right that those who are responsible for reverence to churches should place within the sacred bounds an eating place, nor offer food there, nor make other sales. For God our Saviour teaching us when he was tabernacling in the flesh commanded not to make his Father's house a house of merchandize. He also poured out the small coins of the money-changers, and drove out all those who made common the temple. If, therefore, anyone shall be taken in the aforesaid fault let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 77</h2>

<p>It is not right that those who are dedicated to religion, whether <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetics</a>,  should wash in the bath with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, nor should any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> do so. For this is severely condemned by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. But if any one is caught in this thing, if he is a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 78</h2>

<p>It behooves those who are illuminated to learn the Creed by heart and to recite it to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> on the Fifth Feria of the Week.</p>

<h2>Canon 79</h2>

<p>As we confess the divine birth of the Virgin to be without any childbed, since it came to pass without seed, and as we preach this to the entire flock, so we subject to correction those who through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> do anything which is inconsistent therewith. Wherefore since some on the day after the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Nativity of Christ our God are seen cooking <span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B4;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x1FD6;&#x03BD;</span>, and distributing it to each other, on pretext of doing <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <em>puerperia</em> of the spotless Virgin Maternity, we decree that henceforth nothing of the kind be done by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. For this is not honouring the Virgin (who above thought and speech bare in the flesh the incomprehensible Word) when we define  and describe, from ordinary things and from such as occur with ourselves, her ineffable parturition. If therefore anyone henceforth be discovered doing any such thing, if he be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, but if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 80</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or any of those who are enumerated in the list of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, has no very grave necessity nor difficult business so as to keep him from church for a very long time, but being in town does not go to church on three consecutive Sundays&mdash; three weeks&mdash; if he is a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, but if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 81</h2>

<p>Whereas we have heard that in some places in the hymn Trisagion there is added after <q>Holy and Immortal,</q> <q>Who was crucified for us, have mercy upon us,</q> and since this as being alien to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was by the ancient and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers cast out of the hymn, as also the violent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who inserted these new words were cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; we also, confirming the things which were formerly piously established by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who after this present decree allow in church this or any other addition to the most sacred hymn; but if indeed he who has transgressed is of the sacerdotal order, we command that he be deprived of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity, but if he be a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 82</h2>

<p>In some pictures of the venerable icons, a lamb is painted to which the Precursor points his finger, which is received as a type of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, indicating beforehand through the Law, our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lamb, Christ our God. Embracing therefore the ancient types and shadows as <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and patterns given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we prefer <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> receiving it as the fulfilment of the Law. In order therefore that <q>that which is perfect</q> may be delineated to the eyes of all, at least in coloured expression, we decree that the figure in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of the Lamb who takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world, Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be henceforth exhibited in images, instead of the ancient lamb, so that all may understand by means of it the depths of the humiliation of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and that we may recall to our memory his conversation in the flesh, his passion and salutary death, and his redemption which was wrought for the whole world.</p>

<h2>Canon 83</h2>

<p>No one may give the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> to the bodies of the dead; for it is written <q>Take and eat.</q> But the bodies of the dead can neither <q>take</q> nor <q>eat.</q></p>

<h2>Canon 84</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Following</span> the canonical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Fathers, we decree concerning infants, as often as they are found without trusty witnesses who say that they are undoubtedly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and as often as they are themselves unable on account of their age to answer satisfactorily in respect to the initiatory <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> given to them; that they ought without any offense to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, lest such a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> might deprive them of the sanctification of such a purification.</p>

<h2>Canon 85</h2>

<p>We have received from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established. Therefore we decree that slaves who are manumitted by their masters in the presence of three witnesses shall enjoy that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; for they being present at the time will add strength and stability to the liberty given, and they will bring it to pass that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will be kept in those things which they now <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> were done in their presence.</p>

<h2>Canon 86</h2>

<p>Those who to the destruction of their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> procure and bring up harlots, if they be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, they are to be [cut off and] deposed, if <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> to be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 87</h2>

<p>She who has left her husband is an adulteress if she has come to another, according to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and divine Basil, who has gathered this most excellently from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah: <q>If a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has become another man's, her husband shall not return to her, but being defiled she shall remain defiled;</q> and again, <q>He who has an adulteress is senseless and impious.</q> If therefore she appears to have departed from her husband without reason, he is deserving of pardon and she of punishment. And pardon shall be given to him that he may be in communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But he who leaves the wife lawfully given him, and shall take another is guilty of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> by the sentence of the Lord. And it has been decreed by our Fathers that they who are such must be <q>weepers</q> for a year, <q>hearers</q> for two years, <q>prostrators</q> for three years, and in the seventh year to stand with the faithful and thus be counted worthy of the Oblation [if with tears they do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>].</p>

<h2>Canon 88</h2>

<p>No one may drive any beast into a church except perchance a traveller, urged thereto by the greatest necessity, in default of a shed or resting-place, may have turned aside into said church. For unless the beast had been taken inside, it would have perished, and he, by the loss of his beast of burden, and thus without means of continuing his journey, would be in peril of death. And we are taught that the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was made for man: wherefore also the safety and comfort of man are by all means to be placed first. But should anyone be detected without any necessity such as we have just mentioned, leading his beast into a church, if he be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, and if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 89</h2>

<p>The faithful spending the days of the Salutatory Passion in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and compunction of heart, ought to fast until the midnight of the Great <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>: since the divine Evangelists, Matthew and Luke, have shown us how late at night it was [that the resurrection took place], the one by using the words <span class="greek">&#x1F40;&#x03A8;&#x1F72; &#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03B2;&#x03B2;&#x1F71;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span>, and the other by the words <span class="greek">&#x1F44;&#x03C1;&#x03B8;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C5; &#x03B2;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> .</p>

<h2>Canon 90</h2>

<p>We have received from our divine Fathers the canon law that in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> resurrection, we are not to kneel on Sundays. Lest therefore we should ignore the fullness of this observance we make it plain to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> that after the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have gone to the Altar for Vespers on Saturdays (according to the prevailing custom) no one shall kneel in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> until the evening of Sunday, at which time after the entrance for compline, again with bended knees we offer our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. For taking the night after the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, which was the forerunner of our Lord's resurrection, we begin from it to sing in the spirit <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, leading our feast out of darkness into light, and thus during an entire day and night, we celebrate the Resurrection.</p>

<h2>Canon 91</h2>

<p>Those who give drugs for procuring <a href="../cathen/01046b.htm">abortion</a>, and those who receive poisons to kill the f&oelig;tus, are subjected to the penalty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 92</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod decrees that those who in the name of marriage carry off <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and those who in any way assist the ravishers, if they be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, they shall lose their rank, but if they be <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> they shall be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 93</h2>

<p>If the wife of a man who has gone away and does not appear, cohabit with another before she is assured of the death of the first, she is an adulteress. The wives of soldiers who have married husbands who do not appear are in the same case; as are also they who on account of the wanderings of their husbands do not wait for their return. But the circumstance here has some excuse, in that the suspicion of his death becomes very great. But she who in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> has married a man who at the time was deserted by his wife, and then is dismissed because his first wife returns to him, has indeed committed fornication, but through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; therefore she is not prevented from marrying, but it is better if she remain as she is. If a soldier shall return after a long time, and find his wife on account of his long absence has been united to another man, if he so wishes, he may receive his own wife [back again], pardon being extended in consideration of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> both to her and to the man who took her home in second marriage.</p>

<h2>Canon 94</h2>

<p>The canon subjects to penalties those who take <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> oaths, and we decree to them excommunication.</p>

<h2>Canon 95</h2>

<p>Those who from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> come over to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and to the number of those who should be saved, we receive according to the following order and custom. <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, Macedonians, Novatians, who call themselves Cathari, Aristeri, and Testareskaidecatit&aelig;, or Tetradit&aelig;, and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarians</a>, we receive on their presentation of certificates and on their <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which does not hold as does the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostolic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>: then first of all we anoint them with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> chrism on their foreheads, eyes, nostrils, mouth and ears; and as we seal them we say&mdash; <q>The seal of the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q></p>

<p>But concerning the Paulianists it has been determined by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that they shall by all means be rebaptized. The Eunomeans also, who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with one immersion; and the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, who here are called Phrygians; and the Sabellians, who consider the Son to be the same as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and are guilty in certain other grave matters, and all the other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>&mdash; for there are many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> here, especially those who come from the region of the Galatians&mdash; all of their number who are desirous of coming to the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we receive as <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. And on the first day we make them <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, on the second Catechumens, then on the third day we <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcise</a> them, at the same time also breathing thrice upon their faces and ears; and thus we initiate them, and we make them spend time in church and hear the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; and then we <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> and Marcionites and all of similar <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> must give certificates and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> each his own <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and also <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, Eutyches, Dioscorus, Severus, and the other chiefs of such <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and those who think with them, and all the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>; and so they become partakers of the <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">holy Communion</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 96</h2>

<p>Those who by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> have put on Christ have professed that they will copy his manner of life which he led in the flesh. Those therefore who adorn and arrange their hair to the detriment of those who see them, that is by cunningly devised intertwinings, and by this means put a bait in the way of unstable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, we take in hand to cure paternally with a suitable punishment: training them and teaching them to live soberly, in order that having laid aside the deceit and vanity of material things, they may give their minds continually to a life which is blessed and free from mischief, and have their conversation in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, pure, [and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ]; and thus come as near as possible to God through their purity of life; and adorn the inner man rather than the outer, and that with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and good and blameless manners, so that they leave in themselves no remains of the left-handedness of the adversary. But if any shall act contrary to the present canon let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 97</h2>

<p>Those who have commerce with a wife or in any other manner without regard thereto make sacred places common, and treat them with contempt and thus remain in them, we order all such to be expelled, even from the dwellings of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> which are in the venerable temples. And if any one shall not observe these directions, if he be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, but if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 98</h2>

<p>He who brings to the intercourse of marriage a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to another man who is still alive, is to lie under the charge of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 99</h2>

<p>We have further learned that, in the regions of the Armenians, certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> boil joints of meat within the sanctuary and offer portions to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, distributing it after the Jewish fashion. Wherefore, that we may keep the church undefiled, we decree that it is not lawful for any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to seize the separate portions of flesh meat from those who offer them, but they are to be content with what he that offers pleases to give them; and further we decree that such offering be made outside the church. And if any one does not thus, let him be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 100</h2>

<p><q>Let your eyes behold the thing which is right,</q> orders Wisdom, <q>and keep your heart with all care.</q> For the bodily senses easily bring their own impressions into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore we order that henceforth there shall in no way be made pictures, whether they are in paintings or in what way so ever, which attract the eye and corrupt the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and incite it to the enkindling of base pleasures. And if any one shall attempt to do this he is to be cut off.</p>

<h2>Canon 101</h2>

<p>The great and divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> with loud voice calls man created in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the body and temple of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Excelling, therefore, every sensible creature, he who by the saving Passion has attained to the celestial dignity, eating and drinking Christ, is fitted in all respects for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, sanctifying his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body by the participation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>. Wherefore, if any one wishes to be a participator of the immaculate Body in the time of the Synaxis, and to offer himself for the communion, let him draw near, arranging his hands in the form of a cross, and so let him receive the communion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But such as, instead of their hands, make vessels of gold or other materials for the reception of the divine gift, and by these receive the immaculate communion, we by no means allow to come, as preferring inanimate and inferior matter to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if any one shall be found imparting the immaculate Communion to those who bring vessels of this kind, let him be cut off as well as the one who brings them.</p>

<h2>Canon 102</h2>

<p>It behooves those who have received from God the power to loose and bind, to consider the quality of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the readiness of the sinner for conversion, and to apply medicine suitable for the disease, lest if he is injudicious in each of these respects he should fail in regard to the healing of the sick man. For the disease of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not simple, but various and multiform, and it germinates many mischievous offshoots, from which much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is diffused, and it proceeds further until it is checked by the power of the physician. Wherefore he who professes the science of spiritual medicine ought first of all to consider the disposition of him who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and to see whether he tends to health or (on the contrary) provokes to himself disease by his own behaviour, and to look how he can care for his manner of life during the interval. And if he does not resist the physician, and if the ulcer of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is increased by the application of the imposed medicaments, then let him mete out mercy to him according as he is worthy of it. For the whole account is between God and him to whom the pastoral rule has been delivered, to lead back the wandering sheep and to cure that which is wounded by the serpent; and that he may neither cast them down into the precipices of despair, nor loosen the bridle towards dissolution or contempt of life; but in some way or other, either by means of sternness and astringency, or by greater softness and mild medicines, to resist this sickness and exert himself for the healing of the ulcer, now examining the fruits of his repentance and wisely managing the man who is called to higher illumination. For we ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> two things, to wit, the things which belong to strictness and those which belong to custom, and to follow the traditional form in the case of those who are not fitted for the highest things, as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Basil teaches us.</p>
