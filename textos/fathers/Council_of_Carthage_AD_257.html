<h1>Council of Carthage (A.D. 257)</h1>

<p><strong>The Synod held at Carthage over which presided the Great and Holy Martyr Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage.</strong></p>

<p>When very many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were met together at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> on the Calends of September from the province of Africa, Numidia and Mauritania, with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> (the greater part of the people being likewise present) and when the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> letters of Jubaianus to Cyprian had been read, and Cyprian's answers to Jubaianus, concerning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> baptisms, as well as what the same Jubaianus afterwards wrote to Cyprian,</p>

<p>Cyprian said: You have heard, my dearly beloved colleagues, what our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Jubaianus has written to me, taking counsel of my littleness concerning the illicit and profane baptisms of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and the answer which I made him; being of the same opinion as we have been on former occasions, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and sanctified with the Church's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Moreover there has been read to you also the other letter of Jubaianus, in which answering for his sincere and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> devotion to our letter, not only he agrees therewith but offered thanks that he has been so instructed by it. It only remains therefore that we, each one of us, one by one, say what our mind is in this matter, without condemning any one or removing any one from the right of communion who does not agree with us.</p>

<p>For no one [of us ] has set himself up [to be] <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> [of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>],  or attempted with tyrannical dread to force his colleagues to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to him, since every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has, for the license of liberty and power, his own will, and as he cannot be judged by another, so neither can he judge another. But we await the judgment of our universal Lord, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who one and alone has the power, both of advancing us in the governance of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and of judging of our actions [in that position].</p>

<p>[<em>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> then one by one declared against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a></em>.  <em>Last of all</em> (col. 796)]:</p>

<p>Cyprian, the Confessor and Martyr of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, said: The letter which was written to Jubaianus, my colleague, most fully set forth my opinion, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who, according to the evangelical and apostolic <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, are called adversaries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> and anti-Christs, when they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the one (<em>unico</em>) <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that they may become instead of adversaries friends, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> instead of Antichrists.</p>
