<h1>Council of Carthage (A.D. 419)</h1>

<p><strong>Commonly Called The Code of Canons of the African Church.</strong></p>

<h2>Introductory Note</h2>

<p><q>Councils were nowhere more frequently called in the Primitive Times than in Africa. In the year 418-19, all canons formerly made in sixteen councils held at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, one at Milevis, one at Hippo, that were approved of, were read, and received a new sanction from a great number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, then met in synod at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. This Collection is the Code of the African Church, which was always in greatest repute in all Churches next after the Code of the Universal Church. This code was of very great authority in the old English Churches, for many of the Excerptions of Egbert were transcribed from it. And though the Code of the Universal Church ends with the canons of Chalcedon,  yet these African Canons are inserted into the Ancient Code both of the Eastern and Western Churches. These canons though ratified and approved by a synod, yet seem to have been divided or numbered by some private and unlearned hand, and have probably met with very unskilful transcribers, by which means some of them are much confounded and obscured, as to their sense and coherence. They are by Dionysius Exiguus and others entitled <em>The Canons of the Synod of Africa</em>. And though all were not originally made at one time, yet they were all confirmed by one synod of African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who, after they had recited the Creed and the twenty canons of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, proceeded to make new canons, and re-enforce old ones.</q></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> was formerly the head of the whole of Africa, as St. Augustine tells us in his Epistle CLXII. From this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it happened that a great number of councils were held there, gathered from all the provinces of Africa. Especially while Aurelius as Archbishop was occupying the throne were these meetings of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> frequently holden; and by these, for the establishing of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline in Africa, many canons were enacted. At last, after the consulate of Honorius (XII.) and Theodosius (VIII.), Augustuses, on the eighth day before the Calends of June, that is to say, on May 25, in the year of our Lord 419, another Council was held in the same city at which all the canons previously adopted were considered, and the greater part of them were again confirmed by the authority of the synod. These canons, thus confirmed by this council, merited to be called from that day to this <q>The Code of Canons of the African Church.</q> These canons were not at first adopted in Greek but in Latin, and they were confirmed in the same language. This Dionysius Exiguus distinctly testifies to in his preface to the <q>Code of Ecclesiastical Canons,</q> in which they are included. It is uncertain when the canons of this Carthaginian synod were done into Greek. This only is certain, that they had been translated into Greek before the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Council in Trullo</a> by which, in its Second Canon, they were received into the Greek Nomocanon, and were confirmed by the authority of this synod; so that from that time these canons stand in the Eastern Church on an equality with all the rest.</p>

<p>An extremely interesting point arises as to what was the authority of the collection as a collection, and how this collection was made? There seems no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the collection substantially as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it was the code accepted by the Council of Trullo, the canons of which received a quasi-ecumenical authority from the subsequent general imprimatur given them by the Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second of Nice.

<p>Here is a list of the various councils which made the enactments, with their dates.</p>

<p>The numbering of the African councils differs very widely between the different writers, and Cave reckons nine between 401 and 608, and thirty-five Carthaginian between 215 and 533.  Very useful tables, showing the conclusions of Fuchs, are found at the end of Bruns, <em>Canones Apostolorum et Conciliorum Veterum Selecti</em>.</p>

<h2>An Ancient Introduction</h2>

<p>(<em>Found in Dionysius Exiguus</em>, Codex Can. <em>Migne</em>, Pat. Lat., Tom. lxvii., col. 182.)</p>

<p>After the consulate of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> emperors, Honorus for the twelfth time and Theodosius for the eighth time, Augustuses, on the VIII. before the Calends of June at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, in the Secretarium of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of Faustus, when Pope Aurelius had sat down, together with Valentine of the primatial see of the province of Numidia, and Faustinus of the Potentine Church, of the Italian province Picenum, a legate of the Roman Church, and also with legates of the different African provinces, that is to say, of the two Numidias, of Byzacena, of Mauritania C&aelig;sariensis, as well as of Tripoli, and with Vincent Colositanus, Fortunatian, and other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the proconsular province, in all two hundred and seventeen, also with Philip and Asellus, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and legates of the Roman Church, and while the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were standing by, Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said, etc., <em>ut infra</em>.</p>

<h2>The Canons</h2>

<p>Aurelius the Bishop said:  You, most blessed brethren, remember that after the day fixed for the synod we discussed many things while we were waiting for our brethren who now have been sent as delegates and have arrived at the present synod, which must be placed in the acts. Wherefore let us render thanks to our Lord for the gathering together of so great an assembly. It remains that the acts of the Nicene Synod which we now have, and have been determined by the fathers, as well as those things enacted by our predecessors here, who confirmed that same Synod, or which according to the same form have been usefully enacted by all grades of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, from the highest even to the lowest, should be brought forward. The whole Council said: Let them be brought forward.</p>

<p>Daniel the Notary read: The profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or statutes of the Nicene Synod are as follows.</p>

<p>And while he was speaking, Faustinus, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the people of Potentia, of the Italian province of Picenum, a legate of the Roman Church said: There have been entrusted to us by the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> certain things in writings, and certain other things as in ordinances to be treated of with your blessedness as we have called to memory in the acts above, that is to say, concerning the canons made at Nice, that their decrees and customs be observed; for some things are observed out of decree and canon, but some from custom. Concerning these things therefore in the first place let us make enquiry, if it please your blessedness; and afterwards let the other ordinances which have been adopted or proposed be confirmed; so that you may be able to show by your rescripts to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and that you may declare to the same venerable Pope, that we have diligently remembered these things; although the headings of action taken had been already inserted in the acts.  In this matter we should act, as I have said above, as shall please your beloved blessedness. Let, therefore the commonitorium come into the midst, that you may be able to recognize what is contained in it, so that an answer can be given to each point.</p>

<p>Aurelius said: Let the commonitorium be brought forward, which our brethren and fellow-ministers lately placed in the acts, and let the rest of the things done or to be done, follow in order.</p>

<p>Daniel the Notary read the Commonitorium. To our brother Faustinus and to our sons, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> Philip and Asellus, Zosimus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. You well remember that we committed to you certain businesses, and now [we bid you] carry out all things as if we ourselves were there (for), indeed, our presence is there with you; especially since you have this our commandment, and the words of the canons which for greater certainty we have inserted in this our commonitory. For thus said our brethren in the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> when they made these decrees concerning the appeals of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><q>But it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had been accused, etc.</q> [<em>Here follows</em> verbatim <em>Canon v. of Sardica</em>.]</p>

<p> <em>Ancient epitome: If <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> shall have deposed a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and if he appeal to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman bishop</a>, he should be benignantly heard, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman bishop</a> writing or ordering.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>And when this had been read, Alypius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Tagastine Church, and legate of the province of Numidia, said: On this matter there has been some legislation in former sessions of our council, and we profess that we shall ever observe what was decreed by the Nicene Council; yet I remember that when we examined the Greek copies of this Nicene Synod, we did not find these the words quoted&mdash; Why this was the case, I am sure I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For this reason we beg your reverence, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope Aurelius, that, as the authentic record of the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> are said to be preserved in the city of Constantinople, you would deign to send messengers with letters from your Holiness, and not only to our most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, but also to the venerable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Alexandria and <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, who shall send to us the decrees of that council with the authentification of their signatures, so that hereafter all ambiguity should be taken away, for we failed to find the words cited by our brother Faustinus; notwithstanding this however we promise to be ruled by them for a short time, as I have already said, until reliable copies come to hand. Moreover the venerable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Roman Church, Boniface, should be asked likewise to be good enough to send messengers to the aforementioned churches, who should have the same copies according to his rescript, but the copies of the aforementioned Nicene Council which we have, we place in these Acts.</p>

<p>Faustinus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, legate of the Roman Church, said: Let not your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> do dishonour to the Roman Church, either in this matter or in any other, by saying the canons are doubtful, as our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Alypius has vouchsafed to say: but do you deign to write these things to our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most blessed pope, so that he seeking out the genuine canons, can treat with your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> on all matters decreed. But it suffices that the most blessed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> should make enquiry just as your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> proposes doing on your part, that there may not seem to have arisen any contention between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, but that you may the rather be enabled to deliberate with fraternal charity, when he has been heard from, what is best should be observed.</p>

<p>Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said: In addition to what is set down in the acts, we, by the letters from our insignificance, must more fully inform our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Boniface of everything which we have considered. Therefore if our plan pleases all, let us be informed of this by the mouth of all. And the whole council said: It seems good to us.</p>

<p>Novatus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, legate of Mauritania Sitifensis, said: We now call to mind that there is contained in this commonitory something about <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, how they should be tried by their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or by those adjoining, a provision which we find nothing of in the Nicene Council. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> let your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> order this part to be read.</p>

<p>Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said: Let the place asked for be read. Daniel the notary read as follows: Concerning the appeals of clergymen, that is of those of inferior rank, there is a sure answer of this very synod, concerning which thing what you should do, we think should be inserted, as follows:</p>

<p><q>Hosius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said: I should not conceal what has come into my mind up to this time. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> perchance has been quickly angered (a thing what should not happen) and has acted quickly or sharply against a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of his, and has wished to drive him out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, provision should be made that the innocent be not condemned, or be deprived of communion: he that has been ejected should have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of appeal to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the bordering <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, that his case should be heard, and it should be carried on all the more diligently because to him who asks a hearing it should not be denied. And the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who either <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> rejected him, should patiently allow the affair to be discussed, so that his sentence be either approved or else emended, etc.</q></p>

<p>And when this had been read, Augustine, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Hippo of the province of Numidia, said: We promise that this shall be observed by us, provided that upon more careful examination it be found to be of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>. Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said. If this also is pleasing to the charity of you all, give it the confirmation of your vote. The whole Council said: Everything that has been ordained by the Nicene Council pleases us all. Jocundus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Suffitula, legate of the province of Byzacena, said: What was decreed by the Nicene Council cannot in any particular be violated.</p>

<p>Faustinus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, legate of the Roman Church, said: So far as has developed by the confession of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> as well as of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Alypius, and of our brother Jocundus, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that some of the points have been made weak and others confirmed, which should not be the case, since even the very canons themselves have been brought into question. Therefore, that there may be harmony between us and your blessedness, let your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> deign to refer the matter to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and venerable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Roman Church, that he may be able to consider whether what St. Augustine vouchsafed to enact, should be conceded or not, I mean in the matter of appeals of the inferior grade. If therefore there still is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, on this head it is right that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the most blessed see be informed, if this can be found in the canons which have been approved.</p>

<p>Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said: As we have suggested to your charity, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> allow the copies of the statutes of the Nicene Council to be read and inserted in the acts, as well as those things what have been most healthfully defined in this city by our predecessors, according to the rule of that council, and those which now have been ordained by us. And the whole council said: The copies of the Creed, and the statutes of the Nicene Synod which formerly were brought to our council through C&aelig;cilean of blessed memory, the predecessor of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> (who was present at it), as well as the copies of the decrees made by the Fathers in this city following them, or which now we have decreed by our common consultation, shall remain inserted in these <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> acts, so that (as has been already said) your blessedness may vouchsafe to write to those most venerable men of the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>, and of that of Alexandria, and also of that of Constantinople, that they would send most accurate copies of the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> under the authentification of their signatures, by which, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the matter having become evident, those chapters which in the commonitory our brother who is present, and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Faustinus, as well as our fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> Philip and Asellus brought with them, if they be found therein, may be confirmed by us; or if they be not found, we will hold a synod and consider the matter further. Daniel the notary read the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> and its statutes to the African Council.</p>

<p>The statutes also of the Nicene Council in twenty heads were likewise read, as are found written before. Then what things were promulgated in the African Synods, were inserted in the present acts.</p>

<h3>Canon 1.</h3>

<p><strong>That the statutes of the Nicene Council are to be scrupulously observed</strong></p>

<p>Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said: Such are the statutes of the Nicene Council, which our fathers at that time brought back with them: and preserving this form, let these things which follow, adopted and confirmed by us, be kept firm.</p>

<h3>Canon 2.</h3>

<p><strong>Of Preaching the Trinity</strong></p>

<p>The whole Council said: By the favour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by a unanimous confession the Church's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which through us is handed down should be confessed in this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> assembly before anything else; then the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order of each is to be built up and strengthened by the consent of all. That the minds of our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> lately elevated may be strengthened, those things should be propounded which we have certainly received from our fathers, as the unity of the Trinity, which we retain <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in our senses, of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which has no difference, as we say,  so we shall instruct the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover by all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> lately promoted it was said: So we openly confess, so we hold, so we teach, following the Evangelic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and your teaching.</p>

<h3>Canon 3.</h3>

<p><strong>Of Continence</strong></p>

<p>Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said: When at the past council the matter on continency and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> was considered, those three grades, which by a sort of bond are joined to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> by their consecration, to wit <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, so it seemed that it was becoming that the sacred rulers and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of God as well as the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, or those who served at the divine <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, should be continent altogether, by which they would be able with singleness of heart to ask what they sought from the Lord: so that what the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> taught and antiquity kept, that we might also keep.</p>

<h3>Canon 4.</h3>

<p><strong>Of the different orders that should abstain from their wives</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Faustinus</span>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Potentine Church, in the province of Picenum, a legate of the Roman Church, said: It seems good that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or whoever perform the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, should be keepers of modesty and should abstain from their wives.</p>

<p>By all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> it was said: It is right that all who serve the altar should keep <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">pudicity</a> from all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 5.</h3>

<p><strong>Of Avarice</strong></p>

<p>Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: The cupidity of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> (which, let no one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, is the mother of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things), is to be henceforth prohibited, lest anyone should usurp another's limits, or for gain should pass beyond the limits fixed by the fathers, nor shall it be at all lawful for any of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to receive <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> of any kind. And those new edicts (<em>suggestiones</em>) which are obscure and generally ambiguous, after they have been examined by us, will have their value fixed (<em>formam accipiunt</em>); but with regard to those upon which the Divine Scripture has already most plainly given judgment, it is unnecessary that further sentence should be pronounced, but what is already laid down is to be carried out. And what is reprehensible in <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> is worthy of still more severe censure in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The whole synod said: No one has gone contrary to what is said in the Prophets and in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> with impunity.</p>

<h3>Canon 6.</h3>

<p><strong>That the chrism should not be made by presbyters</strong></p>

<p>Fortunatus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: In former councils we remember that it was decreed that the chrism or the reconciliation of penitents, as also the consecration of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> be not done by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>: but should anyone be discovered to have done this, what ought we to decree with regard to him?</p>

<p>Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said: Your worthiness has heard the suggestion of our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Fortunatus; What answer will you give?</p>

<p>And all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> replied: Neither the making of the chrism, nor the consecration of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, is to be done by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, nor is it permitted to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> to reconcile anyone in the public mass (<em>in publica missa</em>), this is the pleasure of all of us.</p>

<h3>Canon 7.</h3>

<p><strong>Concerning those who are reconciled in peril of death</strong></p>

<p>Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said: If anyone had fallen into peril of death during the absence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and had sought to reconcile himself to the divine altars, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> should consult the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and so reconcile the sick man at his bidding, which thing we should strengthen with healthy counsel. By all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> it was said: Whatever your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has taught us to be necessary, that is our pleasure.</p>

<h3>Canon 8.</h3>

<p><strong>Of those who make accusation against an elder; and that no criminal is to be suffered to bring a charge against a bishop</strong></p>

<p>Numidius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Maxula, said: Moreover, there are very many, not of good life, who think that their elders or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be the butt for accusation; ought such to be easily admitted or no? Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said: Is it the pleasure of your charity that he who is ensnared by various wickednesses should have no voice of accusation against these?</p>

<p>All the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said: If he is criminous, his accusation is not to be received.</p>

<h3>Canon 9.</h3>

<p><strong>Of those who on account of their deeds are justly cast forth from the congregation of the Church</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Augustine</span> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the legate of the Numidian province, said: Deign to enact that if any perchance have been rightly on account of their crimes cast forth from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and shall have been received into communion by some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, such shall be considered as guilty of an equal crime with them who flee away from the judgment of their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. And all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said: This is the pleasure of all of us.</p>

<h3>Canon 10.</h3>

<p><strong>Of presbyters who are corrected by their own bishops</strong></p>

<p>Alypius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a legate of the province of Numidia, said: Nor should this be passed over; if by chance any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> when corrected by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, inflamed by self-conceit or <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, has thought fit to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to God separately [from the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>] or has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it right to erect another altar, contrary to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and discipline, such should not get off with impunity. Valentine, of the primatial see of the province of Numidia, said: The propositions made by our brother Alypius are of necessity congruous to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; therefore enact what seems good to your belovedness.</p>

<h3>Canon 11.</h3>

<p><strong>If any presbyter, inflated against his bishop, makes a schism, let him be anathema</strong></p>

<p>All the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said: If any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> shall have been corrected by his superior, he should ask the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be heard by them and that through them he may be reconciled to his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>: but if he shall not have done this, but, puffed up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, (which may God forbid!) he shall have thought it proper to separate himself from the communion of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and separately shall have offered the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and made a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> with certain accomplices, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, and let him lose his place; and if the complaint which he brought against his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall [not] have been found to be well founded, an enquiry should be instituted.</p>

<h3>Canon 12.</h3>

<p><strong>If any bishop out of Synod time shall have fallen under accusation, let his cause be heard by 12 bishops</strong></p>

<p>Felix the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: I suggest, according to the statutes of the ancient councils, that if any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (which may God forbid!) shall have fallen under any accusation, and there shall have been too great necessity to wait for the summoning of a majority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, that he may not rest under accusation, let his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be heard by 12 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and let a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> be heard by six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> shall be heard by three.</p>

<h3>Canon 13.</h3>

<p><strong>That a bishop should not be ordained except by many bishops, but if there should be necessity he may be ordained by three</strong></p>

<p>Bishop Aurelius said: What says your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> on this matter? By all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> it was answered: The decrees of the ancients must be observed by us, to wit, that without the consent of the Primate of any province even many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled together should not lightly presume to ordain a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But should there be a necessity, at his bidding, three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should ordain him in any place they happen to be, and if anyone contrary to his profession and subscription shall come into any place he shall thereby deprive himself of his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 14.</h3>

<p><strong>That one of the bishops of Tripoli should come as legate, and that a presbyter might be heard there by five bishops</strong></p>

<p>It also seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from Tripoli, on account of the poverty of the province, should come as a legation, and that there a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> might be heard by five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> by three, as has been noted above, his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presiding.</p>

<h3>Canon 15.</h3>

<p> <em>Of the various orders who serve the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that if any one fall into a criminal business and refused to be tried by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> court, he ought to be in danger therefor; and that the sons of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (</em>sacerdotum <em>) are not to attend worldly shows.</em></p>

<p>Moreover it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that if any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who had a criminal charge brought against him or who had a civil <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, refused to be tried by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunal, but wished to be judged by the secular courts, even if he won his suit, nevertheless he should lose his office.</p>

<p>This is the law in a criminal suit; but in a civil suit he shall lose that for the recovery of which he instituted the proceedings, if he wishes to retain his office.</p>

<p>This also seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that if from some <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> judges an appeal was taken to other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> judges who had a superior jurisdiction, this should in no way injure the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of those from whom the appeal was taken, unless it could be shown that they had given sentence moved by <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> or some other mental bias, or that they had been in some way corrupted. But if by the consent of both parties judges had been chosen, even if they were fewer in number than is specified, no appeal can be taken.</p>

<p>And [it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>] that the sons of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should not take part in nor <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> secular spectacles. For this has always been forbidden to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, so let them abstain from them, that they may not go where cursing and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> are to be found.</p>

<h3>Canon 16.</h3>

<p><strong>That no bishop, presbyter or deacon should be a <q>conductor;</q> and that Readers should take wives; and that the clergy should abstain from usury; and at what age they or virgins should be consecrated</strong></p>

<p>Likewise it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> should not be <q>conductors</q> or <q>procurators;</q> nor seek their food by any base and vile business, for they should remember how it is written, <q>No man fighting for God cumbers himself with worldly affairs.</q></p>

<p>Also it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that Readers when they come to years of puberty, should be compelled either to take wives or else to profess continence.</p>

<p>Likewise it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that if a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> had lent money he should get it back again, but if kind (<em>speciem</em>) he should receive back the same kind as he gave.</p>

<p>And that younger than twenty-five years <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> should not be ordained, nor <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>.</p>

<p>And that readers should not salute the people.</p>

<h3>Canon 17.</h3>

<p><strong>That any province on account of its distance, may have its own Primate</strong></p>

<p>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that Mauretania Sitiphensis, as it asked, should have a Primate of its own, with the consent of the Primate of Numidia from whose synod it had been separated.  And with the consent of all the primates of the African Provinces and of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> permission was given, by reason of the great distance between them.</p>

<h3>Canon 18. (Gk. xviii. <em>The Latin caption is the canon of the Greek</em>.)</h3>

<p><strong>If any cleric is ordained he ought to be admonished to observe the constitutions</strong></p>

<p>And that neither the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> nor Baptism should be given to the bodies of the dead.</p>

<p>And that every year in every province the Metropolitans come together in synod.</p>

<h3>(Gk. Canon xix.)</h3>

<p>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that before <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were ordained, the provisions of the canons should be brought to their notice, lest, they might afterwards repent of having through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> acted contrary to law.</p>

<h3>(Gk. Canon xx.)</h3>

<p>It also seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> should not be given to the bodies of the dead. For it is written: <q>Take, Eat,</q> but the bodies of the dead can neither <q>take</q> nor <q>eat.</q> Nor let the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those who are dead.</p>

<h3>(Gk. Canon xxi.)</h3>

<p>And therefore in this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod should be confirmed in accordance with the Nicene decrees, on account of Ecclesiastical causes, which often are delayed to the injury of the people, that every year there should be a synod, to which all, who are primates of the provinces, should send <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as legates, from their own synods, two or as many as they choose; so that when the synod meets it may have full power to act.</p>

<h3>Canon 19. (Greek xxii.)</h3> 

<p><strong>That if any bishop is accused the cause should be brought before the primate of his own province</strong></p>

<p>Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: Whatever <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is accused the accuser shall bring the case before the primates of the province to which the accused belongs, and he shall not be suspended from communion by reason of the crime laid to his charge unless he fails to put in an appearance on the appointed day for arguing his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> before the chosen judges, having been duly summoned by the letters; that is, within the space of one month from the day in which he is found to have received the letters. But should he be able to prove any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> necessity which manifestly rendered it impossible for him to appear, he shall have the opportunity of arguing his case within another full month; but after the second month he shall not communicate until he is acquitted.</p>

<p>But if he is not willing to come to the annual general council, so that his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> may there be terminated, he himself shall be judged to have pronounced the sentence of his own condemnation at the time in which he does not communicate, nor shall he communicate either in his own church or diocese.</p>

<p>But his accuser, if he has not missed any of the days for pleading the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, shall not be shut out from communion; but if he has missed some of them, withdrawing himself, then the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall be restored to communion and the accuser shall be removed from communion; so, nevertheless, that the possibility of going on with the case be not taken from him, if he shall prove that his absence was caused by lack of power and not by lack of will.</p>

<p>And this is enacted, that if the accuser turn out to be himself a criminal when the case against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has come to argument, he shall not be allowed to testify unless he asserts that the causes are personal and not <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 20. (Greek xxiii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of accused presbyters or clerks</strong></p>

<p>But if <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> shall have been accused, there shall be joined together from the neighbouring places with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the diocese, the legitimate number of colleagues, whom the accused shall seek from the same; that is together with himself six in the case against a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, in that against a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> three. They shall discuss the causes, and the same form shall be kept with regard to days and postponements and removals from communion, and in the discussion of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> between the accusers and the accused.</p>

<p>But the causes of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place shall take cognizance of and determine alone.</p>

<h3>Canon 21. (Greek xxiv.)</h3>

<p><strong>That the sons of clergymen are not to be joined in marriage with heretics</strong></p>

<p>Likewise it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the sons of clergymen should not be joined in matrimony with gentiles and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 22. (Greek xxv.)</h3>

<p><strong>That bishops or other clergymen shall give nothing to those who are not Catholics</strong></p>

<p>And that to those who are not <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, even if they be blood relations, neither <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> nor clergymen shall give anything at all by way of donation of their possessions.</p>

<h3>Canon 23. (Greek xxvi.)</h3>

<p><strong>That bishops shall not go across seas</strong></p>

<p>Item, That <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> shall not go beyond seas without consulting the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the primatial see of his own province: so that from him they may be able to receive a formed or commendatory letter.</p>

<h3>Canon 24. (Greek xxvii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That nothing be read in church besides the Canonical Scripture</strong></p>

<p>Item, that besides the Canonical Scriptures nothing be read in church under the name of <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>.</p>

<p>But the Canonical Scriptures are as follows:</p>

<p>Let this be sent to our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Boniface, and to the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of those parts, that they may confirm this canon, for these are the things which we have received from our fathers to be read in church.</p>

<h3>Canon 25. (Greek xxviii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Concerning bishops and the lower orders who wait upon the most holy mysteries. It has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that these abstain from their wives</strong></p>

<p>Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: We add, most dear brethren, moreover, since we have heard of the incontinency of certain <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, even of readers, towards their wives, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that what had been enacted in various councils should be confirmed, to wit, that subdeacons who wait upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> according to former statutes,  should contain from their wives, so that they should be as though they had them not and unless they so act, let them be removed from office. But the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are not to be compelled to this, unless they be of mature age. And by the whole council it was said: What your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has said is just, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we confirm it.</p>

<h3>Canon 26. (Greek xxix.)</h3>

<p> <em>That no one should take from the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</em> </p>

<p>Likewise it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that no one should sell anything belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: that if there was no revenue, and other great necessity urged thereto, this might be brought before the Metropolitan of the province that he might deliberate with the appointed number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whether this should be done: that if such urgent necessity lay upon any church that it could not take counsel beforehand, at least let it call together the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as witnesses, taking care to refer all the necessities of his church to the council: and that if he shall not do this, he shall be held as responsible toward <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as a seller in the eye of the council, and he shall have lost thereby his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<p>It also was confirmed that if <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were convicted of any of the greater crimes on account of which it was necessary that they should be removed from the ministry, that hands should not be laid upon them as upon penitents, or as upon faithful <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, nor should it be permitted that they be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> over again and then advanced to the clerical grade.</p>

<p>Likewise it pleased the whole Council that he who shall have been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for any neglect, whether he be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or any other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, and shall have presumed while still under sentence, and his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> not yet heard, to receive communion, he shall be considered by so doing to have given sentence against himself.</p>

<p> <em>Concerning the accused or accuser</em>. </p>

<p>Likewise it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the accused, or the accusor, if (living in the same place as the accused) he fears some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be done him by the tumultuous multitude, may choose for himself a place near by, where the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> may be determined, and where there will be no difficulty in producing the witnesses.</p>

<h3>Canon 31. (Greek xxxiv.)</h3>

<p><strong>If certain clerics advanced by their own bishops are supercilious, let them not remain whence they are unwilling to come forth</strong></p>

<p>It also seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that whoever of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> would not help the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the necessities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, when he wished to lift them to a higher position in his diocese, should no longer be allowed to exercise the functions of that grade from which they were not willing to be removed.</p>

<h3>Canon 34. (Greek xxxvii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That nothing of those things enacted in the Synod of Hippo is to be corrected</strong></p>

<p>Bishop <span class="sc">Epigonius</span> said: In this summary (<em>Breviarium</em>) which was adopted at the Synod of Hippo, we think nothing should be amended, nor anything added thereto except that the day on which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> falls should be announced in Synod.</p>

<h3>Canon 35. (Greek xxxviii.)</h3>

<p>That <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> should not easily let their children pass out of their power; unless they were secure of their morals and age, that their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may pertain to them.</p>

<h3>Canon 36. (Greek xxxix.)</h3>

<p><strong>That bishops or clergymen are not to be ordained unless they have made all their family Christians</strong></p>

<p>None shall be ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> before all the inmates of their houses shall have become <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the body and blood of the Lord nothing else shall be offered than that which the Lord himself ordained, that is to say, bread and wine mixed with water. But let the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, whether honey or milk, be offered on that one most solemn day, as is wont, in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the infants. For although they are offered on the altar, let them have nevertheless their own benediction, that they may be distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the Lord's body and blood; neither let there be offered as <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> anything other than grapes and corns.</p>

<h3>Canon 39. (Greek xlii.)</h3>

<p> <em>That a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should not be called the chief of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</em> </p>

<h3>Canon 40. (Greek xliii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Concerning the non-frequenting of taverns by the clergy, except when travelling</strong></p>

<p>That the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are not to enter taverns for eating or drinking, nor unless compelled to do so by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of their journey.</p>

<h3>Canon 41. (Greek xliv.)</h3>

<p><strong>That by men who are fasting sacrifices are to be offered to God</strong></p>

<p>That the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacraments of the Altar</a> are not to be celebrated except by those who are <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, except on the one anniversary of the celebration of the Lord's Supper; for if the commemoration of some of the dead, whether <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or others, is to be made in the afternoon, let it be only with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, if those who officiate have already breakfasted.</p>

<h3>Canon 42. (Greek xiv.)</h3>

<p><strong>Concerning the not having feasts under any circumstances in churches</strong></p>

<p>That no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are to hold feasts in churches, unless perchance they are forced thereto by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of hospitality as they pass by. The people, too, as far as possible, are to be prohibited from attending such feasts.</p>

<h3>Canon 43. (Greek xlvi.)</h3>

<p><strong>Concerning penitents</strong></p>

<p>That to penitents the times of their penance shall be assigned by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> according to the difference of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> shall not reconcile a penitent without consulting the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, unless the absence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> urges him necessarily thereto. But when of any penitent the offense has been public and commonly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, so as to have scandalized the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he shall receive imposition of the hand before the altar (Lat. <q>before the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a></q>).</p>

<h3>Canon 44. (Greek xlvii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Concerning Virgins</strong></p>

<p>That <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> when they are separated from their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> by whom they have been wont to be guarded, are to be commended by the care of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is absent, to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of graver age, so that  living with them they may take care of them, lest they hurt the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by wandering about.</p>

<h3>Canon 45. (Greek xlviii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Concerning those who are sick and cannot answer for themselves</strong></p>

<p>That the sick are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> who cannot answer for themselves if their [servants] shall have spoken at their own proper peril a testimony of the good will [of the sick man].</p>

<p>(Greek Canon xlix.)</p>

<p> <em>Concerning players who are doing penance and are converted to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</em> </p>

<p>That to players and actors and other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of that kind, as also to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> when they are converted  and return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or reconciliation is not to be denied.</p>

<h3>Canon 46. (Greek l.)</h3>

<p><strong>Concerning the passions of the martyrs</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the Martyrs may be read when their anniversary days are celebrated.</p>

<h3>Canon 47. (Greek li.)</h3>

<p> <em>Concerning [the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> and</em>  <em>] the children <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>.</em></p>

<p>Concerning the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>  it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that we should hold counsel with our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> Siricius and Simplician concerning those infants alone who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>:  lest what they did not do of their own will, when they should be converted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> with a salutary determination, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> might prevent their promotion to the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar.</p>

<p>But when these things had been begun, Honoratus and Urbanus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Mauritania  Sitifensis, said: When some time ago we were sent to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, we laid aside what things had been written on this account, that we might wait for the arrival of our brethren the legates from Numidia. But because not a few days have passed in which they have been looked for and as yet they are not arrived, it is not fitting that we should delay any longer the commands we received from our brother-<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and therefore, brethren, receive our story with alacrity of mind. We have heard concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Nicene tractate: True it is that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are to be forbidden after breakfast, so that they may be offered as is right by those who are <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and this has been confirmed then and now.</p>

<h3>Canon 48. (Greek lii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of rebaptisms, reordinations, and translations of bishops</strong></p>

<p>But we suggest that we decree what was set forth by the wisdom of the plenary synod at Capua, that no rebaptisings, nor reordinations should take place, and that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should not be translated. For Cresconius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Villa Regis, left his own people and invaded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Tubinia and having been admonished down to this very day, to leave, according to the decree, the diocese he had invaded, he treated the admonition with disdain. We have heard that the sentence pronounced against him has been confirmed; but we seek, according to our decree, that you deign to grant that being driven thereto by necessity, it be free to us to address the rector of the province against him, according to the statutes of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> princes, so that whoever is not willing to acquiesce in the mild admonition of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and to amend his lawlessness, shall be immediately cast out by judicial authority. Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said: By the observance of the constituted form, let him not be judged to be a member of the synod, if he has been asked by you, dear brethren, to depart and has refused: for out of his own contempt and contumacy he has fallen to the power of the secular magistrate.  Honoratus and Urban the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said: This pleases us all, does it not? And all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> answered: It is just, it pleases us.</p>

<h3>Canon 49. (Greek liii.)</h3>

<p><strong>How many bishops there should be to ordain a bishop</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Honoratus</span> and Urban, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, said: We have issued this command, that (because lately two of our brethren, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Numidia, presumed to ordain a pontiff,) only by the concurrence of twelve <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the ordination of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> be celebrated. Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: The ancient form shall be preserved, that not less than three suffice who shall have been designated for ordaining the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Moreover, because in Tripoli, and in Arzug the barbarians are so near, for it is asserted that in Tripoli there are but five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and out of that number two may be occupied by some necessity; but it is difficult that all of the number should come together at any place whatever; ought this circumstance to be an impediment to the doing of what is of utility to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? For in this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to which your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has deigned to assemble  we frequently have ordinations and nearly every Lord's day; could I frequently summon twelve, or ten, or about that number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>? But it is an easy thing for me to join a couple of neighbours to my littleness. Wherefore your charity will agree with me that this cannot be observed.</p>

<h3>Canon 50. (Greek liv.)</h3>

<p><strong>How many bishops should be added to the number of those ordaining, if any opposition had been made to the one to be ordained</strong></p>

<p>But this should be decreed, that when we shall have met together to choose a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, if any opposition shall arise, because such things have been treated by us, the three shall not presume to purge  him who was to be ordained, but one or two more shall be asked to be added to the aforesaid number, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of those objecting shall first be discussed in the same place (<em>plebe</em>) for which he was to be ordained. And last of all the objections shall be considered; and only after he has been cleared in the public sight shall he at last be ordained. If this agrees with the mind of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, let it be confirmed by the answer of your worthiness. All the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said, We are well pleased.</p>

<h3>Canon 51. (Greek lv.)</h3>

<p><strong>That the date of Easter is to be announced by the Church of Carthage</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Honoratus</span> and Urban, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, said: Since all things treated by our commonitory are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>,  we add also what has been ordered concerning the day of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, that we be informed of the date always by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, as has been accustomed and that no short time before. Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: If it seems good to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, since we remember that we pledged ourselves sometime ago that every year we would come together for discussion, when we assemble, then let the date of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">holy Easter</a> be announced through the legates present at the Council. Honoratus and Urban, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, said: Now we seek of the present assembly that you deign to inform our province of that day by letters. Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: It is necessary it should be so.</p>

<h3>Canon 52. (Greek lvi.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of visiting provinces</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Honoratus</span> and Urban, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, said: This was commanded to us in word, that because it had been decreed in the Council of Hippo that each province should be visited in the time of the council, that you also deign that this year or next, according to the order you have drawn up, you should visit the province of Mauritania.</p>

<p>Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: Of the province of Mauritania because it is situated in the confines of Africa, we have made no decree, for they are neighbours of the barbarians; but God grant (not however that I make any rash promise of doing so), we may be able to come to your province. For you should consider, brethren, that this same thing our brethren of Tripoli and of the Arzuges region  could demand also, if occasion offered.</p>

<h3>Canon 53. (Greek lvii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That dioceses should not receive a bishop except by the consent of its own bishop</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Epigonius</span>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: In many councils it has been decreed by the sacerdotal assembly that such communities as are contained in other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and ruled by their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and which never had any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their own, should not receive rulers, that is <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, for themselves except with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> under whose jurisdiction they have been. But because some who have attained a certain domination abhor the communion of the brethren, or at least, having become depraved, claim for themselves domination with what is really tyranny, for the most part tumid and stolid <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, who lift up their heads against their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or else win the people to themselves by feasting them or by malignant persuasion, that they may by unlawful favour wish to place themselves as rulers over them; we indeed hold fast that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> desire of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> brother Aurelius, for you have often opposed these things, paying no heed to such petitioners; but on account of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts and basely conceived designs this I say, that such a community, which has always been subject in a diocese, ought not to receive a rector, nor should it ever have a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of its own. Therefore if this which I have proposed seems good to the whole most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council, let it be confirmed.</p>

<p>Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: I am not in opposition to the proposition of our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>: but I confess that this has been and shall be my practice concerning those who were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not only with regard to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, but concerning every sacerdotal assemblage. For there are many who, as has been said, conspire with the people whom they deceive, tickling their ears and blandly seducing them, men of vicious lives, or at least puffed up and separated from this meeting, who think to watch over their own people, and never come to our council for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should be discussed. I say, if it seems good, that not only should these not keep their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, but that every effort should be made to have them expelled by public authority from that church of theirs which has evilly favoured them, and that they be removed even from the chief sees. For it is right that he who cleaves to all the brethren and the whole council, should possess with full right not only his church but also the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. But they who think that the people suffice them and spurn the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brethren, shall not only lose their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, but (as I have said,) they shall be deprived by public authority of their own cures as rebels. Honoratus and Urban, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, said: The lofty provision of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> obtains the adherence of the minds of all of us, and I think that by the answer of all what you have deigned to propose will be confirmed. All the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said: Placet, placet.</p>

<h3>Canon 54. (Greek lviii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That a strange cleric is under no circumstances to be received by another</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Epigonius</span>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: This has been decreed in many councils, also just now it has been confirmed by your <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, most blessed brethren, that no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should receive a strange <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> into his diocese without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to whose jurisdiction the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> belongs. But I say that Julian, who is ungrateful for the layouts bestowed upon him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through my littleness, is so rash and audacious, that a certain man who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by me, when he was a most needy boy, commended to me by the same, and when for many years he had been fed and reared by me, it is certain that this one, as I have said, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in my church, by my own unworthy hands; this same man began to exercise the office of reader in the Mappalien diocese, and read there for nearly two years, with a most incomprehensible contempt of my littleness, the aforenamed Julian took this man, whom he declared to be a citizen of his own city Vazarita, and without consulting me ordained him <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. If, most blessed brethren, that is permissible, let it be declared to us; but if not, let such an impudent one be restrained that he may in no way mix himself in someone's communion.</p>

<p>Numidius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: If, as it seems, Julian did this without your worthiness being asked for his consent, nor even consulted, we all judge that this was done iniquitously and unworthily. Wherefore unless Julian shall correct his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and shall return the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> to your people with proper satisfaction, since what he did was contrary to the decrees of the council, let him be condemned and separated from us on account of his contumacy. Epigonius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: Our father in age, and most ancient by his promotion, that laudable man, our brother and colleague Victor wishes that this petition should be made general to all.</p>

<h3>Canon 55. (Greek lix.)</h3>

<p><strong>That it be lawful for the bishop of Carthage to ordain a cleric whenever he wishes</strong></p>

<p>Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: My brethren, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> allow me to speak. It often happens that ecclesiastics who are in need seek <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> [<em>pr&aelig;positis</em> in the Latin], or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from me: and I, bearing in mind what things have been ordained these I observe, to wit, I summon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> who is sought for, and I show him the state of affairs, how that they of a certain church ask for a certain one of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Perchance then they make no objection, but lest it happen that afterwards they might object when in this case they shall have been demanded (<em>postulati</em>) by me, who (as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>) have the care of many churches and of the ordinands. It is right therefore that I should summon a fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with two or three witnesses from our number. But if he be found <em>indevotus</em> [<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03C9;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>], what does your charity think should be done? For I, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, brethren, by the condescension of God have the care of all the churches.</p>

<p>Numidius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said:  This see always had the power of ordaining a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> according to the desire of each Church as he wills and on whose name there was agreement (<em>fuisset conventus</em>). Epigonius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: Your good nature makes small use of your powers, for you make much less use of them than you might, since, my brother, you are good and gentle to all; for you have the power, but it is far from your practice to satisfy the person of each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in prima tantummodo conventione. But if it should be thought that the rights of this see ought to be vindicated, you have the duty of supporting all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, wherefore we do not give you power, but we confirm that power you have, viz.: that you have the right at your will always to choose whom you will, to constitute  prelates over peoples and churches who shall have asked you to do so, and when you so desire. Posthumianus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: Would it be right that he who had only one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> should have that one taken away from him? Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: But there may be one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by whom many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> can be made through the divine goodness, but one fit to be made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is found with difficulty. Wherefore if any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> necessary for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> and has one only, my brother, as you have said, even that one he ought to give up for promotion. Posthumianus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: If some other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has plenty of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, should that other diocese come to my help? Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: Of course, when you have come to the help of another Church, he who has many <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> should be persuaded to make one over to you for ordination.</p>

<h3>Canon 56. (Greek lx.)</h3>

<p> <em>That <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were ordained for <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> shall not choose for themselves <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> [</em>in the Greek <em>provinces].</em></p>

<p><span class="sc">Honoratus</span> and Urban, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, said: We have heard that it has been decreed that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> should not be deemed fit to receive <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, unless with the consent of their founder: but in our province since some have been ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the diocese, by the consent of that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by whose power they were established, have even seized <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> for themselves, this should be corrected by the judgment of your charity, and prohibited for the future. Epigonius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: To every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be reserved what is right, so that from the mass of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> no part should be snatched away, so as to have its own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, without consent from the proper authority. For it shall suffice, if the consent be given, that the diocese thus set apart have its own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> only, and let him  not seize other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, for only the one cut off from the many merited the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of receiving a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it is pleasing to the charity of you all, that he who was ordained for a diocese by the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who held the mother see, should retain only the people for whom he was ordained. Since therefore I think that everything has been treated of, if all things are agreeable to your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> confirm them all by your suffrage. All the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said: We all are well pleased, and we have confirmed them with our subscription. And they signed their names.</p>

<h3>Canon 57. (Greek lxi.)</h3>

<p><strong>That persons baptized when children by the Donatists may be ordained clergymen in the Catholic Church</strong></p>

<p>Since in the former council it was decreed, as your unanimity remembers as well as I do, that those who as children were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, and not yet being able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the pernicious character of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and afterward when they had come to the use of reason, had received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, abhorred their former <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and were received, (in accordance with the ancient order) by the imposition of the hand, into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of God spread throughout the world, that to such the remembrance of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> ought to be no impediment to the reception of the clerical office. For in coming to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they thought the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church to be their own and there they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the Trinity. And that all these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are altogether <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and divine is most certain, and in them the whole hope of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is placed, although the presumptuous audacity of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, taking to itself the name of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, dares to administer them. They are but one after all, as the blessed Apostle tells us, saying: <q>One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>,</q> and it is not lawful to reiterate what once only ought to be administered. [Those therefore who have been so <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>] having <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> may be received by the imposition of the hand into the one Church, the pillar as it is called, and the one mother of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, where all these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> are received unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and everlasting life; even the same <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which obtain for those persevering in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> the heavy penalty of damnation. So that which to those who are in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> lightens to the obtaining of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, the same to them who are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> tends but to darkness and damnation. With regard then to those who, having fled from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, acknowledge the breasts of their mother the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and receive all these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and besides the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> have the testimony of a good life, there is no one who would not grant that without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may be raised to the clerical office, especially in such necessity as the present. But there are others of this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, who being already clergymen, desire to pass to us with their peoples and also with their honours, such as for the sake of office are converts to life, and that they may retain them seek for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> [i.e., enter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>]. I think that the question concerning such may be left to the graver consideration of our aforesaid  brothers, and that when they have considered by their more <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> counsel the matter referred to them, they may vouchsafe to advise us what approves itself to them with regard to this question. Only concerning those who as children were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> we decree that they consent, if it seems good, to our decision concerning the ordination of the same. All things, therefore, which we have set forth above with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, let your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> fraternity with me adjudge to be done.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Wherefore</span> the most religious Emperors should be asked  that they order the remaining <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to be taken entirely away throughout all Africa; for in many maritime places and in various possessions the iniquity of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> still flourishes: that they command them to be taken away and their temples, (such as are no ornament, being set up in fields or out of the way places) be ordered to be altogether destroyed.</p>

<h3>Canon 59. (Greek lxiii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That clerics be not compelled to give testimony in public concerning the cognizance of their own judgment</strong></p>

For upon these days, shame to say, they perform the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> leapings throughout the fields and open places, so that matronal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and the modesty of innumerable <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who have come out of devotion for the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day are assaulted by lascivious injuries, so that all approach to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion itself is almost fled from.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it must be sought that theatrical spectacles and the exhibition of other plays be removed from the Lord's day and the other most sacred days of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, especially because on the octave day of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">holy Easter</a> [i.e., <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a>] the people assemble rather at the circus than at church, and they should be transferred to some other day when they happen to fall upon a day of devotion, nor shall any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> be compelled to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> these spectacles,  especially because in the performance of things contrary to the precepts of God there should be no <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> made by anyone, but (as is right) a man should exercise the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> given him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

And all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said: This prosecution is exceedingly agreeable to us, especially as Equitius was condemned some time ago, his impudent unrest ought to be repelled everywhere more and more for the good estate and health of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Then when all things had been considered and treated of which seem to conduce to the advantage of the church, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> suggesting and admonishing us, we determined to act leniently and pacifically with the before-mentioned men, although they were cut off from the unity of the Lord's body by an unruly dissent, so that (as much as in us lies) to all those who have been caught in the net of their communion and society, it might be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> throughout all the provinces of Africa, how they have been overcome by miserable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, holding different opinions, <q>that perchance,</q> as the Apostle says, when we have corrected  them with gentleness, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should grant them repentance for the acknowledging of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that they might be snatched out of the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who are led captive of him at his will.</q></p>

<h3>Canon 67. (Greek lxx.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of the letters to be sent to the judges, that they may take note of the things done between the Donatists and the Maximianists</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Therefore</span> it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that letters should be given from our council to the African judges, from whom it would seem suitable that this should be sought, that in this matter they would aid the common mother, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that the episcopal authority may be fortified  in the cities; that is to say that by their judicial power and with diligence out of their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they enquire and record in the public acts, that all may have a firm notion of it, what has taken place in all those places in which the Maximianists, who made a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> from them, have obtained basilicas.</p>

<h3>Canon 68. (Greek lxxi.)</h3>

<p><strong>That the Donatist clergy are to be received into the Catholic Church as clergymen</strong></p>

<p>It moreover seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that letters be sent to our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and especially to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, over which our aforesaid venerable brother and colleague Anastasius, presides, that [<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x1F74;</span> in the Greek, <em>quo</em> in the Latin] he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Africa is in great need, for the peace and prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that those <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> who were clergymen and who by good advice had desired to return to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, should be treated according to the will and judgment of each <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who governs the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in that place; and, if it seem good for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peace, they be received with their honours, as it is clear was done in the former times of this same division. And that this was the case the example of the majority, yea, of nearly all the African Churches in which this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> had sprung up, testify; not that the Council which met about this matter in foreign parts should be done away, but that it may remain in force with regard to those who so will to come over to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that there be procured by them no breaking of unity. But those through whom <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity was seen to have been altogether perfected or assisted by the manifest winning of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of their brethren in the places where they live, there shall not be objected to them the decree contrary to their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> adopted by a foreign council, for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is shut off to no one, that is to say, that those ordained by the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> party, if having been corrected they have been willing to return to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are not to be  received in their grades, according to the foreign council; but they are to be excepted through whom they received the advice to return to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity.</p>

<h3>Canon 69. (Greek lxxii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That a legation be sent to the Donatists for the sake of making peace</strong></p>

<p>It further seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that when these things were done, legates should be sent from our number to those of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> whom they hold as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or to the people, for the sake of preaching peace and unity, without which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> cannot be attained; and that these legates should direct the attention of all to the fact that they have no just objection to urge against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And especially that this be made manifest to all by the municipal acts (on account of the weight of their documents) what they themselves had done in the case of the Maximianists, their own schismatics. For in this case it is shown them by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, if they will but heed it, that their separation from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is as iniquitous as they now proclaim the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the Maximianists from themselves to be. Nevertheless from the number, those whom they condemned by the authority of their plenary council, they received back with their honours, and accepted the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which they had given while condemned and cut off. And thus let them see how with stupid heart they resist the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> scattered throughout the whole world, when they do these things on the part of Donatus, neither do they say that they are contaminated by communion with those whom they so receive for the making of peace, and yet they despise us, that is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is established even in the extreme parts of the earth, as being defiled by the communion of those whom the accusers have not been able to win over to themselves. </p>

<h3>Canon 70. (Greek lxxiii.)</h3>

<p><strong>What clerics should abstain from their wives</strong></p>

<p>Moreover since incontinence has been charged against some clergymen with regard to their own wives it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> should according to the statutes already made abstain even from their own wives; and unless they do so that they should be removed from the clerical office. But the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> shall not be forced to this but the custom of each church in this matter shall be followed.</p>

<h3>Canon 71. (Greek lxxiv.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of those who leave in neglect their own people</strong></p>

<p>Moreover it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that no one should be allowed to leave his chief cathedral and go to another church built in the diocese, or to neglect the care and frequent attendance upon his own cathedral by reason of too great care for his own affairs.</p>

<h3>Canon 72. (Greek lxxv.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of the baptism of infants when there is some doubt of their being already baptized</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that whenever there were not found reliable witnesses who could testify that without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and when the children themselves were not, on account of their tender age, able to answer concerning the giving of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to them, all such children should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without scruple, lest a hesitation should deprive them of the cleansing of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. This was urged by the Moorish Legates, our brethren, since they redeem many such from the barbarians.</p>

<h3>Canon 73. (Greek lxxvi.)</h3>

<p><strong>The date of Easter and the date of the Council should be announced</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the day of the venerable <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> should be intimated to all by the subscription of formed letters; and that the same should be observed with regard to the date of the Council, according to the decree of the Council of Hippo, that is to say the X. Calends of September, and that it should be written to the primates of each province so that when they summon their councils they do not impede this day.</p>

<h3>Canon 74. (Greek lxxvii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That no bishop who is an intercessor is to hold the see where he is intercessor</strong></p>

<p>Item, it has been decreed that it is not lawful to any intercessor to retain the see to which he has been appointed as intercessor, by any popular movements and seditions; but let him take care that within a year he provide them with a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>: but if he shall neglect to do so, when the year is done, another intercessor shall be appointed.</p>

<h3>Canon 75. (Greek lxxviii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of asking from the Emperors defenders of the Churches</strong></p>

<p>On account of the afflictions of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> by whose troubles the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is worn out without any intermission, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all that the Emperors be asked to allow defenders for them against the power of the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> to be chosen under the supervision of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 76. (Greek lxxix.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of bishops who do not put in an appearance at Council</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that as often as the council is to be assembled, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are impeded neither by age, sickness, or other grave necessity, come together, and that notice be given to the primates of their several provinces, that from all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> there be made two or three squads, and of each of these squads there be elected some who shall be promptly ready on the council day: but should they not be able to attend, let them write their excuses in the tractory,  or if after the coming of the tractory certain necessities suddenly arise by chance, unless they send to their own primate an account of their impediment, they ought to be content with the communion of their own Church.</p>

<h3>Canon 77. (Greek lxxx.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of Cresconius</strong></p>

<p>Concerning Cresconius of Villa Regis this seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all, that the Primate of Numidia should be informed on this matter so that he should by his letters summon the aforementioned Cresconius in order that at the next plenary Council of Africa he should not put off making an appearance. But if he contemns the summons and does not come, let him recognize the fact that sentence should be pronounced against him.</p>

<h3>Canon 78. (Greek lxxxi.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of the Church of Hippo-Diarrhytus</strong></p>

<p>It further seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that since the destitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Hippo-Diarrhytus should no longer be neglected, and the churches there are retained by those who have declined the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> communion of Equitius, that certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> be sent from the present council, viz.: Reginus, Alypius, Augustine, Maternus, Theasius, Evodius, Placian, Urban, Valerius, Ambivius, Fortunatus, Quodvultdeus, Honoratus, Januarius, Aptus, Honoratus, Ampelius, Victorian, Evangelus and Rogation; and when those had been gathered together, and those had been corrected who with culpable pertinacity were of opinion that this flight of the same Equitius should be waited for, let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be ordained for them by the vote of all. But if these should not be willing to consider peace, let them not prevent the choosing for ordination of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, for the advantage of the church which has been so long destitute.</p>

<h3>Canon 79. (Greek lxxxii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of clerics who do not take care to have their causes argued within a year</strong></p>

<p>It was further decreed that as often as clergymen convicted and confessed  of any crime either on account of eorum, quorum verecundi&aelig; parcitur, or on account of the opprobrium to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and of the insolent glorying of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, if perchance they are willing to be present at their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and to assert their innocence, let them do so within one year of their excommunication; if in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they neglect during a year to purge their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, their voice shall not be heard afterwards.</p>

<h3>Canon 80. (Greek lxxxiii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That it is not permitted to make superiors of monasteries nor to ordain as clerics those who are received from a monastery not one's own</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that if any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> wished to advance to the clericature a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> received from a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> not under his jurisdiction, or shall have appointed him superior of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of his own, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who shall have thus acted shall be separated from the communion of others and shall rest content with the communion of his own people alone, but the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> shall continue neither as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> nor superior.</p>

<h3>Canon 81. (Greek lxxxiv.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of bishops who appoint heretics or heathens as their heirs</strong></p>

<p>Item, it was ordained that if any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should prefer to his Church strangers to blood relationship with him, or his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> as his heirs, he shall be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> even after his death, and his name shall by no means be recited among those of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor can he be excused if he die intestate, because being a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he was bound not to postpone making such a disposition of his goods as was befitting his profession.</p>

<h3>Canon 82. (Greek lxxxv.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of manumissions</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the Emperor be petitioned with regard to announcing manumissions in church.</p>

<h3>Canon 83. (Greek lxxxvi.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of false Memories of Martyrs</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the altars which have been set up here and there, in fields and by the wayside as Memories of Martyrs, in which no body nor <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have been laid up, should be overturned by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who rule over such places, if such a thing can be done. But should this be impossible on account of the popular tumult it would arouse, the people should none the less be admonished not to frequent such places, and that those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> rightly should be held bound by no <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of the place. And no memory of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> should at all be accepted, unless where there is found the body or some <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, on which is declared traditionally and by good authority to have been originally his habitation, or possession, or the scene of his passion. For altars which have been erected anywhere on account of dreams or inane <em>quasi</em>-revelations of certain people, should be in every way disapproved of.</p>

<h3>Canon 84. (Greek lxxxvii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of extirpating the remains of the idols</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to petition the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Emperors that the remains of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> not only in images, but in any places whatever or groves or trees, should altogether be taken away.</p>

<h3>Canon 85. (Greek lxxxviii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That by the bishop of Carthage, when there shall be need, letters shall be written and subscribed in the name of all the bishops</strong></p>

<p>It was said by all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: If any letters are to be composed in the name of the council it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the venerable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who presides over this See should vouchsafe to dictate and sign them in the name of all, among which also are those to the episcopal legates, who are to be sent throughout the African provinces, in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>; and it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the letters given them should contain the tenor of the mandate which they are not to go beyond. And they subscribed: I, Aurelius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> have consented to this decree and having read it have signed it. Likewise all the rest of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> subscribed.</p>

<p>. . . .</p>

<p>In this Council previous decrees are confirmed.</p>

<p>In the fifth consulate of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Emperors Arcadius and Honorius, Augusti, the VI Calends of September, in the City of Milevis, in the secretarium of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>, when Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> had taken his seat in plenary council, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> standing by, Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: Since the body of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church is one, and there is one head of all the members, it has come to pass by the divine permission and assistance given to our weakness, that we, invited out of brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, have come to this church. Wherefore I beg your charity to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that our coming to you is neither superfluous, nor unacceptable to all; and that the consent of all of us may make it manifest that we agree with the decrees already confirmed by the Council at Hippo or which were defined afterwards by a larger synod at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, these shall now be read to us in order. Then at last the agreement of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> will appear clearer than light, if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the things lawfully defined by us in former councils, you have set forth, not only by your consent to these acts, but also by your subscriptions.</p>

<p>Xantippus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the first see of Numidia said: I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what pleased all the brethren and the statutes they confirmed with their hands; we by our subscribing our names show that it pleases us also, and have confirmed them with our superscription.</p>

<p>Nicetius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the first see of Mauritania Sitifensis said: The decrees which have been read, since they do not lack reason, and have been approved by all, these also are pleasing to my littleness, and I will confirm them with my subscription.</p>

<h3>Canon 86. (Greek lxxxix.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of the order of bishops, that those ordained more recently do not dare to take precedence of those ordained before them</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Valentine</span>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: If your good patience will permit, I follow the things which were done in time past in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and which were illustrious having been confirmed by the subscriptions of the brethren, and I profess that we intend to preserve this. For this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline has always remained inviolate: therefore let none of the brethren dare to place himself before those ordained earlier than himself; but by the offices of charity this has always been shown to those ordained earlier, which always should be accepted joyfully by those ordained more recently. Let your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> give command that this order be strengthened by your interlocutions. Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: It would not be fitting that we should repeat these things, were it not for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of certain inconsiderate minds, which would induce us to making such statutes; but this is a common <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> about which our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has spoken, that each one of us should recognize the order decreed to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the more recent should defer to the earlier ordained, and they should presume to do nothing when these have not been consulted. Wherefore I say, now that I think of it, that they who think they may presume to take precedence over those ordained before them, should be coerced suitably by the great council. Xantippus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the first see of Numidia, said: All the brethren present have heard what our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Aurelius has said, what answer do we make? Datian, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: The decrees made by our ancestors should be strengthened by our assent, so that the action taken by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> in past synods should hold fast, being confirmed by the full assent of all of us. And all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said: This order has been preserved by our fathers and by our ancestors, and shall be preserved by us through the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the rights of the primacy of Numidia and of Mauritania being kept intact.</p>

<p><strong>Of the archives and matricula of Numidia</strong></p>

<p>Moreover it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who subscribed in this council that the matricula and the archives of Numidia should be at the first see and in the Metropolis, that is Constantina.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>Johnson. </p>

<p>From this canon it appears that the primacy in Africa was ambulatory, and belonged to the senior <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the province. If the primacy had been fixed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of any certain city, as in other countries, there would have been a salvo or exception for that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as there is in the 24th canon of the Synod of Bracara [Braga] in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, which orders that all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> take place according to their seniority, with a reserve to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the metropolis. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> was not included in this canon; for it is evident that he had a precedence annexed to his see, and that he was in reality a sort of patriarch. The reason why Numidia and Mauritania are particularly mentioned is, that some disputes had been started there on that subject.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 87. (Greek xc.)</h3>

<p><strong>Concerning Quodvultdeus, the bishop</strong></p>

<p>In the case of Quodvultdeus of Centuria, it pleased all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that no one should communicate with him until his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> should be brought to a conclusion, for his accuser when he sought to bring the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> before our council, upon being asked whether he was willing with him to be tried before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, at first said that he was, but on another day answered that he was not willing, and went away. Under these circumstances to deprive him of his bishoprick, before the conclusion of his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, could commend itself to no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> as a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> act.</p>

<h3>Canon 88. (Greek xci.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of Maximian, the bishop</strong></p>

<p>But in the case of Maximian of Vagai  it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that letters be sent from the council both to him and to his people; that he should vacate the bishoprick, and that they should request another to be appointed for them.</p>

<h3>Canon 89. (Greek xcii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That bishops who are ordained shall receive letters from their ordainers bearing the date and the name of the consul</strong></p>

<p>It further seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that whoever thereafter should be ordained by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> throughout the African provinces, should receive from their ordainers letters, written in their own hands, containing the name of the consul and the date, that no altercation might arise concerning which were ordained first and which afterwards.</p>

<h3>Canon 90. (Greek xciii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of those who have once read in church, that they cannot be advanced by others</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that whoever in church even once had read should not be admitted to the ministry (<em>clericatum</em>) by another church.</p>

<p>And they subscribed: I, Aurelius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, have consented to this decree, and, having read it, have signed it. Likewise also the rest of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> signed.</p>

<p> <em>There is set forth in this council what the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> did who were sent as legates across seas.</em></p>

<p>In the consulship of those most illustrious men, the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius Augustus</a>, and Rumoridus, the VIII.  Calends of September, at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of the second region, when Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had taken his seat in plenary council, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> standing by, Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: From stress of circumstances, venerable brethren, I, although so small, have been led to assemble you in council. For a while ago, as your holinesses will remember, while holding a council we sent our brothers as legates to the regions beyond seas. It is right that these should at this meeting of your holinesses narrate the course of their now finished legation, and although yesterday when we were in session concerning this matter, besides <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, we paid some prolonged attention to what they had done, nevertheless it is right that today the discussion of yesterday should be confirmed by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> action.</p>

<p> <em>Of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the African provinces who were not present at this council.</em> </p>

<p>The right order of things demands that first of all we should enquire concerning our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who were to come to this council either from Byzacena or at least from Mauritania, like as they decreed that they would be present in this council. And when Philologius, Geta, Venustianus, and Felician, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of Byzacena had presented and read their letters of legation, and Lucian and Silvanus, legates of the province of Mauritania Sitiphensis, had done the same, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Aurelius said: Let the text of these writings be placed in the acts.</p>

<p><strong>Of the Byzacene bishops</strong></p>

<p>Numidius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: We observe that our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of Byzacena and of the province of Mauritania Sitiphensis have sent legates to the council; we now seek whether the legates of Numidia have come, or at least of the province of Tripoli or of Mauritania-C&aelig;sariensis.</p>

<p><strong>Of the bishops of Mauritania Sitiphensis</strong></p>

<p>Lucian and Silvanus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, legates of the Province of Mauritania Sitiphensis said: The tractory came late to our C&aelig;sarian brethren or they would have been here; and they will certainly come, and we are confident of their attitude of mind that whatever shall be determined by this council, they without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> will assent unto.</p>

<p><strong>Of the bishops of Numidia</strong></p>

<p>Alypius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church of Tagaste said: We have come from Numidia, I and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren Augustine and Possidius, but a legation could not be sent from Numidia, because by the tumult of the recruits the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have either been prevented from coming or fully occupied by their own necessary affairs in their sees. For after I had brought to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Senex Xantippus your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness's</a> tractory, this seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the present business that a council should be appointed, to which a delegation with instructions should be sent, but when I reported to him in later letters the impediment of the recruits, of which I have just spoken, he excused them by his own rescripts. Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the aforesaid brethren and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Numidia, when they shall have received the acts of the council, will give their consent and will take pains to carry into effect whatever shall have been adopted. It is therefore necessary that by the solicitude of this see what we shall have determined be communicated to them.</p>

<p> <em>Of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Tripoli.</em></p>

<p>This is what I could learn concerning our brethren of Tripoli, that they appointed our brother Dulcicius as a legate: but because he could not come, certain of our sons coming from the aforesaid province asserted that the aforesaid had taken shipping, and that it was thought that his arrival had been delayed by storms; nevertheless also concerning these matters, if your charity is willing, this form shall be preserved, that the placets of the council be sent to them. And all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said: What your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has decreed pleases us all.</p>

<h3>Canon 91. (Greek xciv.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of holding meetings with the Donatists</strong></p>

<p>Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: What has come out in the handling of your charity, I think this should be confirmed by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> acts. For the profession of all of you shows that each one of us should call together in his city the chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> either alone and with one of his neighbour <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, so that in like manner in the different cities and places there should be meetings of them assembled by the magistrates or seniors of the places. And let this be made an edict if it seems good to all. And all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said: It seems good to all, and we all have confirmed this with our subscription. Also we desire that your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> sign the letters to be sent from the council to the judges. Aurelius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: If it seems good to your charity, let the form of summoning them be read, in order that we all may hold the same tenour of proceeding. All the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said: Let it be read. L&aelig;tus the Notary read.</p>

<h3>Canon 92. (Greek xcv.)</h3>

<p><strong>Form of convening the Donatists</strong></p>

<p>That <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that church said: What by the authority of that most ample see we shall have impetrated, we ask your gravity to have read, and that you order it to be joined to the acts and carried into effect. When the jussio had been read and joined to the acts, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,  said: Vouchsafe to listen to the mandate to be sent through your gravity to the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, and to insert it in the acts, and to carry it to them, and informs us in your acts of their answer. <q>We, sent by the authority of our <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Council, have called you together, desiring to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in your correction, bearing in mind the charity of the Lord who said: Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and moreover he admonished through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> those who say they are not our brothers, that we ought to say: You are our brethren. Therefore you ought not to despise this pacific commonitory coming of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, so that if you think we have any part of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you do not hesitate to say so: that is, when your council is gathered together, you delegate of your number certain to whom you entrust the statement of your case; so that we may be able to do this also, that there shall be delegated from our Council who with them delegated by you may discuss peacefully, at a determined place and time, whatever question there is which separates your communion from us; and that at length the old <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> may receive an end through the assistance of our Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest through the animosity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, weak <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> people should perish by <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> dissension. But if you shall accept this proposition in a fraternal spirit, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will easily shine forth, but if you are not willing to do this, your distrust will be easily <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q> And when this had been read, all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said: This pleases us well, so let it be. And they subscribed: I, Aurelius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Carthaginian Church, have consented to this decree, and having read it, have subscribed it. Likewise also the rest of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> signed.</p>

<p><strong>This synod sent a legation to the Princes against the Donatists</strong></p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> emperor Honorius Augustus, being consul for the sixth time, on the Calends of July, at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of the second region. In this council Theasius and Euodius received a legation against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. In this council was inserted the commonitorium which follows.</p>

<h3>Canon 93. (Greek xcvi.)</h3>

<p><strong>The character of the Commonitory which the legates received against the Donatists</strong></p>

<p>The Commonitorium for our brothers Theasius and Evodius, sent as legates from the Council of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> to the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and most religious princes. When by the help of the Lord they have come into the presence of the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> princes, they shall declare to them with what fullness of confidence, according to the direction of the council of the year before, the prelates of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> had been urged by the municipal authority to assemble, in order that if they really meant their professions, they might by fit <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> chosen from their number, enter into a peaceful conference with us in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> meekness, and whatever they held as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they might not hesitate to declare it frankly; so that from such conference the sincerity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position, which has been conspicuous for so long a time, might be perceived even by those who from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or obstinacy were opposing themselves to it. But deterred by their want of confidence they scarcely ventured to reply. And forsooth, because we had discharged toward them the offices which become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and peacemakers, and they had no answer to make to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they betook themselves to unreasonable acts of brute force, and treacherously oppressed many of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, to say nothing of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. And some of the churches they actually invaded, and tried to assault still others.</p>

<p>And now, it behooves the gracious clemency of their Majesties to take measures that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which has begotten them as worshippers of Christ in her womb, and has nourished them with the strong meat of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, should by their forethought, be defended, lest violent men, taking advantage of the times of religious excitement, should by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> overcome a weak people, whom by argument they were not able to pervert. It is well known how often the vile gatherings (<em>detestabilis manus</em>) of the Circumcelliones  have been forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and also condemned by many decrees of the Emperors, their majesties most religious predecessors. Against the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of these people it is not unusual nor contrary to the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> to ask for secular [<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span> in the Greek] protection, since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Apostle, as is related in the authentic Acts of the Apostles, warded off a conspiracy of certain lawless men by the help of the military.  Now then we ask that there be extended to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches, without any dissimulation, the protection of the ordinum [i.e. companies of soldiers, stationed] in each city, and of the holders of the suburban estates in the various places.  At the same time it will be necessary to ask that they give commandment that the law, set forth by their father Theodosius, of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, which imposed a fine of ten pounds of gold upon both the ordainers and the ordained among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and which was also directed against proprietors at whose houses conventicles were held, be confirmed anew; so that it may be effective with <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of this sort when <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, provoked by their wiles, shall lay complaint against them; so that through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> at least, they may cease from making schisms and from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, since they refuse to be cleansed and corrected by the thought of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment.</p>

<p>Let request be also made that the law depriving <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of the power of being able to receive or bequeath by gift or by will, be straightway renewed by their Piety, so that all right of giving or receiving may be taken away from those who, blinded by the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of obstinacy, are determined to continue in the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>.</p>

<p>With regard to those who by considerations of unity and peace are willing to correct themselves, let permission be granted to them to receive their inheritance, the law notwithstanding, even though the bequest by gift or inheritance was made while they were yet living in the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; those of course being excepted, who under the stress of legal proceedings have sought to enter the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for it may well be supposed, that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of this latter sort desired <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, not so much from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the judgment of heaven, as from the greed of earthly gain.</p>

<p>For the furtherance of all these things the help of the Powers (<em>Potestatum</em>) of each one of the provinces is needed. With regard to other matters, whatever they shall perceive is for the Church's interests, this we have resolved that the legation have full authority to do and to carry into effect. Moreover it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to us all, that letters from our assembly should be sent to the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Emperors and most Excellent Worthinesses, whereby they may be assured of the agreement of us all that the legates should be sent by us to their most blessed court.</p>

<p>Since it is a very slow business for us all to set our names to these letters, and in order that they may not be burdened with the signature of each one of us, we desire you, brother Aurelius, that your charity be good enough to sign them in the name of us all. And to this they all agreed.</p>

<p>I, Aurelius, Bishop of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> have consented to this decree and have subscribed my name. And so all the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> subscribed.</p>

<p>Letters ought likewise to be sent to the judges that, until the lord permit the legates to return to us, they give protection through the soldiers of the cities, and through the holders of the farms of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It ought also to be added concerning the dishonest Equitius, which he had shown by laying claim to the jus sacerdotum, that he be rejected from the diocese of Hippo according to the statutes of the Emperors. Letters ought also to be sent to the Bishop of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Rome in commendation of the legates, and to the other Bishops who may be where the Emperor is. To this they assented.</p>

<p>Likewise I, Aurelius, Bishop of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, have consented to this decree, and having read it, have set my name to it.</p>

<p>And all the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> likewise subscribed.</p>

<h3>Canon 94. (Greek xcvii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Summary of Chapters</strong></p>

<p>That a free delegation be sent to the council from all the provinces to Mizoneum. Legates  and letters were ordered to be sent for the purpose of directing the free legation: that became the unity had been made only at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, letters should also be given to the judges, that they might order in the other provinces and cities the work of union to be proceeded with, and the thanksgivings of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> for the whole of Africa concerning the exclusion of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> should be sent with the letters of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to Court (<em>ad Comitatum</em>).</p>

<p>The letters of Pope Innocent were read: that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> ought not readily to carry causes across seas, and this very thing was confirmed by the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves; that on account of thanksgiving and the exclusion of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, two <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> should be sent to Court.</p>

<h3>Canon 95. (Greek xcviii.)</h3>

<p><strong>An universal council to be held only when necessary</strong></p>

<p>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that there should be no more the yearly necessity of fatiguing the brethren; but as often as common <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, that is of the whole of Africa, demands, that letters shall be given on every side to that see in this matter, that a synod should be gathered in that province, where the desirability of it induces; but let the causes which are not of general interest be judged in their own provinces.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>This canon is a tacit revocation of that clause for annual synods in the 18th canon, which was made in a former council.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 96. (Greek xcix.)</h3>

<p><strong>That from judges who have been chosen, no appeals may be taken</strong></p>

<p>If an appeal be taken, let him who makes it choose the judges, and with him he also against whom the appeal is taken; and from their decision no appeal may be made.</p>

<p><strong>Concerning the delegates of the different provinces</strong></p>

<p>When all the delegates of the different provinces came together, they have been most graciously received, that is those of the Numidians, Byzacenes, Stifensian Moors, as well as C&aelig;sarians and Tripolitans.</p>

<p><strong>Concerning the executors of Churches</strong></p>

<p>It has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> moreover that the appointment of five executors should be asked for in all matters pertaining to the necessities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who shall be portioned off in the different provinces.</p>

<h3>Canon 97. (Greek c.)</h3>

<p><strong>That there be sought from the Emperor the protection of Advocates in causes ecclesiastical</strong></p>

<p>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the legates who were about leaving, viz., Vincent and Fortunatian, should in the name of all the provinces ask from the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Emperors to give a faculty for the establishment of scholastic defensors, whose shall be the care of this very kind of business: so that as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>  of the province, they who have received the faculty as defensors of the Churches in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, as often as necessity arises, may be able to enter the private apartments of the judges, so as to resist what is urged on the other side, or to make necessary explanations.</p>

<p> <em>The protest of the Mauritanian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> against Primosus.</em></p>

<p>It is evident that those of Mauritania C&aelig;sariensis gave evidence in their own writings that Primosus had been summoned by the chiefs of the Thiganensian city, that he should present himself to the plenary council according to the imperial constitutions, and, when sought for, as was right, Primosus was not found, at least so the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> reported. But since the same Mauritanians petitioned that letters be sent from the whole synod to the venerable brother, the aged Innocent, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that they should be sent, that he might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Primosus had been sought at the council and not found at all.</p>

<h3>Canon 98. (Greek cii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of the peoples which never had bishops</strong></p>

<p>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that such peoples as had never had <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their own should in no way receive such unless it had been decreed in a plenary council of each province and by the primates, and with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that diocese to which the church belonged.</p>

<h3>Canon 99. (Greek ciii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of people or dioceses returned from the Donatists</strong></p>

<p>Such communities as have returned from the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> and have had <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> may continue to have them even without any action of the councils, but such a community as had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and when he dies wish no longer to have a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of their own, but to belong to the diocese of some other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, this is not to be denied them. Also such <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as before the promulgation of the imperial law concerning unity as brought back their people to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they ought to be allowed still to rule them: but from the time of that law of unity, all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and if perchance there be any instruments of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or things pertaining to its rights should belong to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of those places to whom the places pertained while under the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, whether they be converted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or remain unconverted <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.

<p>Johnson thus condenses and translates: Bishop Maurentius having an information against him, lying before the council, moves for a hearing; but the informers don't appear upon three calls made by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> on the day appointed. The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is referred to Senex Xantippus, Augustinus, and five more summoned by the council, the informers were to make up the number twelve.</p>

<h3>Canon 101. (Greek civ. <em>bis</em>)</h3>

<p><strong>Of making peace between the Churches of Rome and Alexandria</strong></p>

<p>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that a letter be written to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope Innocent concerning the dissension between the Churches of Rome and Alexandria, so that each Church might keep peace with the other as the Lord commanded.</p>

<h3>Canon 102. (Greek cv.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of those who put away their wives or husbands, that so they remain</strong></p>

<p>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that according to evangelical and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> discipline a man who had been put away from his wife, and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> put away from her husband should not be married to another, but so should remain, or else be reconciled the one to the other; but if they spurn this law, they shall be forced to do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, covering which case we must petition that an imperial law be promulgated.</p>

<h3>Canon 103. (Greek cvi.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of the prayers to be said at the Altar</strong></p>

<p>This also seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which had been approved in synod should be used by all, whether prefaces, commendations, or laying on of the hand, and that others contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should not be used by any means, but that those only should be said which had been collected by the learned.</p>

<h3>Canon 104. (Greek cvii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of these who ask from the Emperor that secular judges may take cognizance of their causes</strong></p>

<p>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that whoever should seek from the Emperor, that secular judges should take cognizance of his business, should be deprived of his office; if however, he had asked from the Emperor an episcopal trial, no objection should be made.</p>

<h3>Canon 105. (Greek cviii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of those who do not communicate in Africa and would go across seas</strong></p>

<p>Whoever does not communicate in Africa, and goes to communicate across seas, let him be cast out of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 106. (Greek cix.)</h3>

<p> <em>That those who are going to carry their case to court should be careful to inform either the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> or</em>  <em>the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>.</em></p>

<p>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that whoever wished to go to court, should give notice in the form which is sent to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that from thence also he should receive a formed letter to court. But if receiving only a formed letter to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and saying nothing about the necessity which he had of going to court, he willed immediately to go there, let him be cut off from communion. But if while at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of going to court suddenly arose, let him state his necessity to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a> and let him carry with him a rescript of the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman bishop</a>. But let the formed letters which are issued by primates and by certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to their own <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> have the date of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>; but if it be yet uncertain what is the date of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> of that year, let the preceding Easter's date be set down, as it is customary to date public acts after the consulship.</p>

<p>It further seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that those who were sent as delegates from this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> council should ask of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> princes whatever they saw would be useful against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> and Pagans, and their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>.</p>

<p>It also seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that all conciliar letters be signed by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> alone. And they subscribed: I, Aurelius, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, have consented to this decree, and having read it, now subscribe my name. Likewise also the rest of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> subscribed.</p>

<h3>(Greek cx.)</h3>

<p><strong>Synod against the pagans and heretics</strong></p>

<p>In the consulship of those most illustrious men Bassus and Philip, the xvith Calends of July, at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, in the secretarium of the restored <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>.*  In this council the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Fortunatian received a second appointment as legate against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Item, a council against the pagans and heretics</strong></p>

<p>In the consulship of those most illustrious men Bassus and Philip, the iii. Ides of October at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, in the Secretarium of the restored <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>*. In this council the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Restitutus and Florentius received a legation against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, at the time Severus and Macarius were slain, and on their account the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Euodius, Theasius and Victor were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 107. (Greek cx. continued.)</h3>

<p><strong>A Council concerning a bishop taking cognizance</strong></p>

<p>In the consulate of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Emperors Honorius for the VII th time and Theodosius for the IIId, Augusti, xvii. Calends of July, a synod was held at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of the second region. In this council it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that no one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should claim the right to take cognizance of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. The acts of this council I have not here written down, because it was only provincial and not general.</p>

<h3>(Greek cxi.)</h3>

<p><strong>Synod against the Donatists</strong></p>

<p>After the consulate of the most illustrious Emperors Honorius for the VIII th time and Theodosius for the IV th time, Augusti, xviii. Calends of July, at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of the second region. In this council the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Florentius, Possidius, Pr&aelig;sidius and Benenatus received legation against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, at that time at which a law was given that anyone might practice the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> worship at his own will.</p>

<h3>Canon 108. (Greek cxii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Synod against the heresy of Pelagius and Celestius</strong></p>

<p>In the consulate of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Emperors, Honorius for the XII th time and Theodosius for the VIII th, Augusti most exalted, on the Calends of May, at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> in the secretarium of the Basilica of Faustus. When Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presided over the whole council, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> standing by, it pleased all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whose names and subscriptions are indicated,  met together in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> to define&mdash; </p>

<h3>Canon 109. (Greek cxij. continued.)</h3>

<p><strong>That Adam was not created by God subject to death</strong></p>

<p>That whosoever says that Adam, the first man, was created mortal, so that whether he had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> or not, he would have died in body&mdash; that is, he would have gone forth of the body, not because his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> merited this, but by natural necessity, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 110. (Greek cxii. <em>bis</em>)</h3>

<p><strong>That infants are baptized for the remission of sins</strong></p>

<p>Likewise it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that whosoever denies that infants newly from their mother's wombs should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, or says that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is for remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but that they derive from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> no original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which needs to be removed by the laver of regeneration, from whence the conclusion follows, that in them the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is to be understood as false and not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p>For no otherwise can be understood what the Apostle says, <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has come into the world, and death through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in that all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>,</q> than the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> everywhere diffused has always understood it. For on account of this rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<em>regulam fidei</em>) even infants, who could have committed as yet no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> themselves, therefore are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in order that what in them is the result of generation may be cleansed by regeneration.</p>

<div class="stiki"><p>The following, says Surius, is found in this place in a very ancient codex. It does not occur in the Greek, nor in Dionysius. Bruns relegates it to a foot-note.</p></div>

<p>[Also it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that if anyone should say that the saying of the Lord, <q>In my Father's house are many mansions</q> is to be understood as meaning that in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> there will be a certain middle place, or some place somewhere, in which infants live in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> who have gone forth from this life without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, without which they cannot enter the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. For after our Lord has said: <q>Unless a man be born again of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> he shall not enter the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>,</q> what <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he who has not merited to be coheir with Christ shall become a sharer with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: for he who fails of the right hand without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> shall receive the left hand portion.]</p>

<h3>Canon 111. (Greek cxiij.)</h3>

<p><strong>That the grace of God not only gives remission of sins, but also affords aid that we sin no more</strong></p>

<p>Likewise it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that whoever should say that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which a man is justified through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, avails only for the remission of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and not for assistance against committing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the future, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 112. (Greek cxiij. continued.)</h3>

<p><strong>That the grace of Christ gives not only the knowledge of our duty, but also inspires us with a desire that we may be able to accomplish what we know</strong></p>

<p>Also, whoever shall say that the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord helps us only in not sinning by revealing to us and opening to our understanding the commandments, so that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what to seek, what we ought to avoid, and also that we should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to do so, but that through it we are not helped so that we are able to do what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> we should do, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. For when the Apostle says: <q>Wisdom puffs up, but charity edifies</q> it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> were we to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we have the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ for that which puffs us up, but have it not for that which edifies, since in each case it is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what we ought to do, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to do it; so that wisdom cannot puff us up while charity is edifying us. For as of God it is written, <q>Who teaches man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> so also it is written, <q>Love is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<h3>Canon 113. (Greek cxiiii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That without the grace of God we can do no good thing</strong></p>

<p>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that whosoever should say that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of justification was given to us only that we might be able more readily by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to perform what we were ordered to do through our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>; as if though <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was not given, although not easily, yet nevertheless we could even without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> fulfil the divine commandments, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. For the Lord spoke concerning the fruits of the commandments, when he said: <q>Without me you can do nothing,</q> and not <q>Without me you could do it but with difficulty.</q></p>

<h3>Canon 114. (Greek cxv.)</h3>

<p><strong>That not only humble but also true is that voice of the Saints: <q>If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves.</q></strong></p>

<p>It also seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that as St. John the Apostle says, <q>If we shall say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we deceive ourselves and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us,</q> whosoever thinks that this should be so understood as to mean that out of humility, we ought to say that we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and not because it is really so, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. For the Apostle goes on to add, <q>But if we confess our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he is faithful and just to forgive us our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and to cleanse us from all iniquity,</q> where it is sufficiently clear that this is said not only of humility but also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>. For the Apostle might have said, <q>If we shall say we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> we shall extoll ourselves, and humility shall have no place in us;</q> but when he says, <q>we deceive ourselves and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us</q> he sufficiently intimates that he who affirmed that he had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would speak not that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> but that which is false.</p>

<h3>Canon 115. (Greek cxvi.)</h3>

<p><strong>That in the Lord's Prayer the Saints say for themselves: <q>Forgive us our trespasses</q></strong></p>

<p>It has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that whoever should say that when in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> say, <q>forgive us our trespasses,</q> they say this not for themselves, because they have no need of this petition, but for the rest who are sinners of the people; and that therefore no one of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> can say, <q>Forgive me my trespasses,</q> but <q>Forgive us our trespasses;</q> so that the just is understood to seek this for others rather than for himself; let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just was the Apostle James, when he said, <q>For in many things we offend all.</q> For why was it added <q>all,</q> unless that this sentence might agree also with the psalm, where we read, <q>Enter not into judgment with your servant, O Lord, for in your sight shall no man living be justified;</q> and in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the most wise Solomon: <q>There is no man that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not;</q> and in the book of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Job: <q>He seals in the hand of every man, that every man may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his own infirmity;</q> wherefore even the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just Daniel when in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> said several times: <q>We have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, we have done iniquity,</q> and other things which there <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and humbly he confessed; nor let it be thought (as some have thought) that this was said not of his own but rather of the people's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for he said further on: <q>When I shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and confess my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of my people to the Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> he did not wish to say our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but he said the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his people and his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, since he as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> foresaw that those who were to come would thus misunderstand his words.</p>

<h3>Canon 116. (Greek cxvii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That the Saints say with accuracy, <q>Forgive us our trespasses</q></strong></p>

<p>Likewise also it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that whoever wished that these words of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a>, when we say, <q>Forgive us our trespasses</q> are said by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> out of humility and not in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> let them be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. For who would make a lying <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, not to men but to God? Who would say with his lips that he wished his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven him, but in his heart that he had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be forgiven.</p>

<h3>Canon 117. (Greek cxviii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of peoples converted from the Donatists</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since it was so decreed some years ago by a plenary council, that whatever churches were erected in a diocese before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were made concerning <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> when they became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, should pertain to the sees of those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> through whom their return to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity was brought about; but after the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> whatever churches communicated were to belong there where they belonged when they were <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. But because many controversies afterward arose and are still springing up between <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, which were not then at all in prospect, now it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to this council, that wherever there was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and a <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> party, pertaining to different sees, at whatever time unity has been or shall be made, whether before or after the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, the churches shall belong to that see to which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church which was already there belonged.</p>

<h3>Canon 118. (Greek cxix.)</h3>

<p><strong>How bishops as well Catholic as those who have been converted from the Donatists are to divide between themselves the dioceses</strong></p>

<p>So, too, it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has been converted from the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, that equally there should be divided what shall have been so found where there were two parties; that is, that some places should pertain to one and some to the other; and let the division be made by him who has been the longest time in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, and let the younger choose. But should there be only one place let it belong to him who is found to be the nearer. But should the distance be equal to each of the two cathedrals let it belong to the one the people may choose. But should the old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> wish their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and if the same be the case with the converted <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, let the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the greater number prevail, but should the parties be equal, let it belong to him who has been longest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But if so many places be found in which there were both parties, that an equal division is impossible, as for example, if they are unequal in number, after those places have been distributed which have an equal number, the place that remains over shall be disposed of as is provided above in the case where there is but one place to be treated.</p>

<h3>Canon 119. (Greek cxx.)</h3>

<p><strong>That if a bishop shall possess a diocese which he has snatched from heresy for three years, no one may take it from him</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that if anyone after the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> should convert any place to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity and retain it for three years without opposition, it should not be taken away from him afterwards. If however there was during those three years a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who could claim it and was silent, he shall lose the opportunity. But if there was no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, no prejudice shall happen to the see,  but it shall be lawful when the place that had none shall receive a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to make the claim within three years of that day. Item, if a <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall be converted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party, the time that has elapsed shall not count against him, but from the day of his conversion for three years he shall have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of making a claim on the places which belonged to his See.</p>

<h3>Canon 120. (Greek cxxi.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of those who intrude upon peoples which they think belong to them, without the consent of those by whom they are held</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that whatever <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> seek the peoples whom they consider to pertain to their see, not by bringing their causes before the episcopal judges, but rush in while another is holding the place, all such, (whether said people are willing to receive them or no) shall lose their case. And whoever have done this, if the contention between the two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is not yet finished but still going on, let him depart who intruded without the decree of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> judges; nor let anyone flatter himself that he will retain [what he has seized] if he shall obtain letters from the primate, but whether he has such letters or has them not, it is suitable that he who holds and receives his letters should make it appear then that he has held the church pertaining to him peaceably. But if he has referred any question, let the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be decided by the episcopal judges, whether those whom the primates have appointed for them, or the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom they have chosen by common consent.</p>

<h3>Canon 121. (Greek cxxii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of those who neglect the peoples belonging to them</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that whoever neglect to bring the places belonging to their see into <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity should be admonished by the neighbouring diligent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, that they delay no longer to do this; but if within six months from the day of the convention they do nothing, let them pertain to him who can win them: but with this proviso however, that if he to whom it seemed they naturally belonged can prove that this neglect was intentional and more efficacious in winning them than the greater apparent diligence of others; when the episcopal judges shall be convinced that this is the case, they shall restore the places to his see. If the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> between whom the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> lies are of different provinces, let the Primate in whose province the place is situated about which there is the dispute, appoint judges; but if by mutual consent they have chosen as judges the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, let one or three be chosen: so that if they choose three they may follow the sentence of all or of two.</p>

<h3>Canon 122. (Greek cxxiii.)</h3>

<p><strong>The sentence of the elected judges ought not to be spurned</strong></p>

<p>From the judges chosen by common consent of the parties, no appeal can be taken; and whoever shall be found to have carried such an appeal and contumaciously to be unwilling to submit to the judges, when this has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to the primate, let him give letters, that no one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should communicate with him until he yield.</p>

<h3>Canon 123. (Greek cxxiv.)</h3>

<p><strong>That if a bishop neglects his diocese he is to be deprived of communion</strong></p>

<p>If in the mother cathedrals a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should have been negligent against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, let a meeting be held of the neighbouring diligent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and let his negligence be pointed out to him, so that he can have no excuse. But if within six months after this meeting, if an execution was in his own province, and he had taken no care to convert them to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, no one shall communicate with him till he does his duty. But if no executor shall have come to the places, then the fault shall not be laid to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 124. (Greek cxxv.)</h3>

<p><strong>Of bishops who shall lie with regard to Donatists' communions</strong></p>

<p>If it shall be proven that any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has lied concerning the communion of those [who had been <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>], and had said that they had communicated when he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it was an established fact that they had not done so, let him lose his bishoprick.</p>

<h3>Canon 125. (Greek cxxvi.)</h3>

<p><strong>That presbyters and clerics are not to appeal except to African Synods</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, or other of the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who are to be tried, if they question the decision of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> having been invited by them with the consent of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, shall hear them and determine whatever separates them. But should they think an appeal should be carried from them, let them not carry the appeal except to African councils or to the primates of their provinces. But whoso shall think of carrying an appeal across seas he shall be admitted to communion by no one in Africa.</p>

<h3>Canon 126. (Greek cxxvii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That Virgins, even when minors, should be given the veil</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that whatever <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the dangers of virginal purity, when either a powerful suitor or some ravisher is feared, or if she shall be pricked with some scruple of death that she might die unveiled, at the demand either of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> or of those to whose care she has been entrusted, shall give the veil to a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, or shall have given it while she was under twenty-five years of age, the council which has appointed that number of years shall not oppose him.</p>

<h3>Canon 127. (Greek cxxviii.)</h3>

<p><strong>That bishops be not detained too long in council, let them choose three judges from themselves of the singular provinces</strong></p>

<p>Item, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, lest all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are assembled at a council be kept too long, that the whole synod should choose three judges of the several provinces; and they elected for the province of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> Vincent, Fortunatian, and Clarus; for the province of Numidia Alypius, Augustine, and Restitutus; for the province of Byzacena, with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Senex Donatian the Primate, Cresconius, Jocundus, and &AElig;milian; for Mauritania Sitephensis Severian, Asiaticus, and Donatus; for the Tripolitan province Plautius, who alone was sent as legate according to custom; all these were to take cognizance of all things with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> senex Aurelius, from whom the whole council sought that he should subscribe all things done by the council whether acts or letters. And they subscribed: I, Aurelius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> consent to this decree and having read it sign my name. Likewise also signed they all.</p>

<div class="stiki"><p>Two Sancti Senes mentioned, who we are sure were both primates. See can. 100 (104).</p></div>

<p><strong>Item, at this council there was present a legation from the Roman Church</strong></p>

<p>After the consulate of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> emperors Honorius for the XII th. time and Theodosius for the VIII th., Augusti, on the III. Calends of June, at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, in the Secretarium of the restored <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>, when Aurelius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> together with Faustinus of the church of Potentia in the Italian province of Picenum, a legate of the Roman Church, Vincent of Calvita  (Culositanus), Fortunatian of Naples, Marianus Uzipparensis,  Adeodatus of Simidica, Pentadius of Carpi, Rufinian of Muzuba, Pr&aelig;textatus of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, Quodvultdeus of Veri (Verensis), Candidus of Abbirita, Gallonian of Utica, legates of the proconsular province; Alypius of Tagaste, Augustine of Hippo Regia and Posidonius of Calama, legates of the province of Numidia; Maximian of Aqu&aelig;, Jocundus of Sufetula, and Hilary of Horrea-Cascilia, legates of the province of Byzacena; Novatus of Sitifi and Leo of Mocta, legates of the province of Mauritania Sitiphensis; Ninellus of Rusucarrum, Laurence of Icosium and Numerian of Rusgunium, legates of the Province of Mauritania C&aelig;sariensis, the judges chosen by the plenary council, had taken their seats, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> standing by, and when, after certain things had been accomplished, many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> complained that it was not possible for them to wait for the completion of the rest of the business to be treated of, and that they must hasten to their own churches; it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the whole council, that by all some should be chosen from each province who should remain to finish up what was left to be done. And it came about that those were present whose subscriptions testify that they were present.</p>

<h3>Canon 128. (Greek cxxix.)</h3>

<p><strong>That those out of communion should not be allowed to bring accusation</strong></p>

<p>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all, as it had been decreed by the former councils, concerning what <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were to be admitted to bring accusations against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; and since it had not been expressed what <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should not be admitted, therefore we define, that he cannot properly be admitted to bring an accusation, who had been already <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and was still lying under that censure, whether he that wished to be the accuser were <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>.</p>

<div class="stiki"><p>The Council of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> of 419 had at its first session on May 25th done thus much. But when it met again on the 30th of the same month, it continued the code. The introduction in regard to this new session is this introduction. The Canons then enacted were original, viz. numbers 128, 129, 130, 131, 132 and 133.</p></div>

<h3>Canon 129. (Greek cxxx.)</h3>

<p><strong>That slaves and freedmen and all infamous persons ought not to bring accusation</strong></p>

<p>To all it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that no slaves or freedmen, properly so called, be admitted to accusation nor any of those who by the public <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are debarred from bringing accusation in criminal proceedings. This also is the case with all those who have the stain of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, that is actors, and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> subject to turpitudes, also <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but even all those to whom the right of bringing accusation is denied, are not forbidden to bring accusation in their own suits.</p>

<h3>Canon 130. (Greek cxxxi.)</h3>

<p><strong>That he who has failed to prove one charge shall not be allowed to give evidence to another</strong></p>

<p>So, too, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that as often as many crimes were laid to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> by their accusers, and one of the first examined could not be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>,  they should not be allowed to go on giving evidence on the other counts.</p>

<h3>Canon 131. (Greek CXXXII.)</h3>

<p><strong>Who should be allowed to give evidence</strong></p>

<p>They who are forbidden to be admitted as accusers are not to be allowed to appear as witnesses, nor any that the accuser may bring from his own household. And none shall be admitted to give <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> under fourteen years of age.</p>

<h3>Canon 132. (Greek cxxxiii.)</h3>

<p><strong>Concerning a bishop who removes a man from communion who says he has confessed to the bishop alone his crime</strong></p>

<p>It also seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that if on any occasion a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said that someone had confessed to him alone a personal crime, and that the man now denies it; let not the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> think that any slight is laid upon him if he is not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on his own word alone, although he says he is not willing to communicate with the man so denying through a scruple of his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 133. (Greek cxxxiv.)</h3>

<p><strong>That a bishop should not rashly deprive anyone of communion</strong></p>

<p>As long as his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> will not communicate with one <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should have no communion with that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may be more careful not to charge anyone with what he cannot prove by documentary evidence to others.</p>

<h3>(Greek cxxxv.)</h3>

<p>Bishop Aurelius said: According to the statutes of this whole assembled council, and the opinion of my littleness, it seems good to make an end of all the matters of the whole of the before-manifested title, and let the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> acts receive the discussion of the present day's constitution.</p>

<p>And what things have not yet been expressed (<q>treated of</q> in the Greek) we shall write on the next day through our brethren, Bishop Faustinus and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> Philip and Asellus to our venerable brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Boniface; and they gave their assent in writing.</p>

<h3>Canon 134. (Continuation of cxxxv. in the Greek.)</h3>

<p><strong>Here begins the letter directed from the whole African Council to Boniface, bishop of the City of Rome, by Faustinus the bishop, and Philip and Asellus the presbyters, legates of the Roman Church</strong></p>

<p>To the most blessed lord, and our <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> brother Boniface, Aurelius, Valentine of the primatial See of Numidia, and others present with us to the number of 217 from the whole council in Africa.</p>

<p>Since it has pleased the Lord that our humility should write concerning those things which with us our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren, Faustinus a fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and Philip and Asellus, fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, have done, not to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Zosimus of blessed memory, from whom they brought commands and letters to us, but to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, who is  constituted in his room by divine authority, we ought briefly to set forth what has been determined upon by mutual consent; not indeed those things which are contained in the prolix volumes of the acts, in which, while charity was preserved, yet we loitered not without some little labour of altercation, deliberating those things in the acts which now pertain to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. However the more gratefully would he have received this news as he would have seen a more peaceful ending of the matter, my lord and brother, had he been still in the body! Apiarius the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, concerning whose ordination, excommunication, and appeal no small scandal arose not only at Sicca but also in the whole African Church, has been restored to communion upon his seeking pardon for all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. First our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Urban of Sicca doubtless corrected whatever in him seemed to need correction. For there should have been kept in mind the peace and quiet of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> not only in the present but also in the future, since so many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of such a kind had gone before, that it was incumbent to take care that like or even graver <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> should be prevented thereafter. It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to us that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Apiarius should be removed from the church of Sicca, retaining only the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his grade, and that he should exercise the office of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbyterate</a> wherever else he wished and could, having received a letter to this effect. This we granted without difficulty at his own petition made in a letter. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> before this case should be thus closed, among other things which we were treating of in daily discussions, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the case demanded that we should ask our brothers, Faustinus our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and Philip and Asellus our fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, to set forth what they had been enjoined to treat of with us that they might be inserted in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> acts. And they proceeded to make a verbal statement, but when we earnestly asked that they would present it rather in writing, then they produced the Commonitory. This was read to us and also set down in the acts, which they are bringing with them to you. In this they were bidden to treat of four things with us, first concerning the appeal of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the Pontiff of the Roman Church, second that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should not unbecomingly be sailing to court, thirdly concerning the treating the causes of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> by contiguous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, if they had been wrongly <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by their own, and fourthly concerning the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Urban who should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> or even sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, unless he should have corrected what seemed to need correction. Of all which things concerning the first and third, that is that it is allowed to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and that the causes of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> should be settled by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their own provinces, already last year we have taken pains to insinuate, in our letter to the same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Zosimus of venerable memory, that we were willing to observe these provisions for a little while without any injury to him, until the search for the statutes of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> had been finished. And now we ask of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> that you would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be observed by us the acts and constitutions of our fathers at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, and that you <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be exercised by you there, those things which they brought in the commonitory: that is to say, If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall have been accused, etc. [<em>Here follows Canon vii.</em> of Sardica.]</p>

<p>Item concerning <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has been quickly angered, etc. [<em>Here follows Canon xvii. of Sardica</em>.]</p>

<p>These are the things which have been inserted in the acts until the arrival of the most accurate copies of the Nicene Council, which things,  if they are contained there (as in the Commonitory, which our brethren directed to us from the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> alleged) and be even kept according to that order by you in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in no way could we be compelled either to endure such treatment as we are unwilling to mention or could suffer what is unbearable:  but we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, through the mercy of our Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> presides over the Roman Church, we shall not have to suffer that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> (<em>istum typhum passuri</em>). And there will be kept toward us, what should be kept with brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to us who are making no dispute. You will also perceive according to the wisdom and the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which the most Highest has given you, what should be observed,  if perchance the canons of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> are other [than you suppose]. For although we have read very many copies, yet never have we read in the Latin copies that there were any such decrees as are contained in the commonitory before mentioned. So too, because we can find them in no Greek text here, we have desired that there should be brought to us from the Eastern Churches copies of the decrees, for it is said that there correct copies of the decrees are to be found. For which end we beg your reverence, that you would deign yourself also to write to the pontiffs of these parts, that is of the churches of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Alexandria, and Constantinople,  and to any others also if it shall please your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, that thence there may come to us the same canons decreed by the Fathers in the city of Nice, and thus you would confer by the help of the Lord this most great benefit upon all the churches of the West. For who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the copies of the Nicene Council gathered in the Greek empire are most accurate, which although brought together from so diverse and from such noble Greek churches are found to agree when compared together? And until this be done, the provisions laid down to us in the Commonitory aforesaid, concerning the appeals of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the pontiff of the Roman Church and concerning the causes of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> which should be terminated by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their own provinces, we are willing to allow to be observed until the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> arrives and we trust your blessedness will help us in this according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The rest of the matters treated and defined in our synod, since the aforesaid brethren, our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Faustinus, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> Philip and Asellus are carrying the acts with them, if you deign to receive them, will make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. And they signed.  Our Lord keep you to us for many years, most blessed brother. Alypius, Augustine, Possidius, Marinus and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (217) also signed.</p>

<p> <em>Here begin the rescripts to the African Council from Cyril <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria in which he sends the authentic proceedings of the Nicene Council</em>,  <em>translated from the Greek by Innocent the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>: these letters with the same Nicene council were also sent through the aforementioned <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Innocent and by Marcellus a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Boniface, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Roman Church, on the sixth day before the calends of December in the year 419.</em> </p>

<p>To the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> lords, our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Aurelius, <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, as well as to the whole <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod met in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Cyril salutes your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>I have received with all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at the hands of our son, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Innocent, the letters of your reverence so full of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, in which you express the hope that we will send you most accurate copies of the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers at the Synod held at Nice the metropolis of Bithynia from the archives of our church; with our own certificate of accuracy attached thereto. In answer to which request, most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> lords and brethren, I have thought it necessary to send to you, with our compliments, by our son, Innocent the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, the bearer of these, most faithful copies of the decisions of the synod held at Nice in Bithynia. And when you have sought in the history of the church, you will find them there also. Concerning <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, as you have written, we announce to you that we shall celebrate it on the xviii  before the calends of May of the next indiction. The subscription. May God and our Lord preserve your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod as we desire, dear brethren.</p>

<h3>Canon 136. (Not numbered in the Greek but with a new heading.)</h3>

<p><strong>Here begins the letter of Atticus, bishop of Constantinople to the same</strong></p>

<p>To our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> lords, and rightly most blessed brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Aurelius, Valentine, and  to the other beloved ones met together in the Synod held at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Atticus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<p>By our son Marcellus the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, I have received with all thanksgiving the writings of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, praising the Lord that I enjoyed the blessing of so many of my brethren. O my lords and most blessed brethren, you have written asking me to send you most accurate copies of the canons enacted at the city of Nice, the metropolis of Bithynia, by the Fathers for the exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And who is there that would deny to his brethren the common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or the statutes decreed by the Fathers. Wherefore by the same son of mine, Marcellus, your <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, who was in great haste, I have sent to you the canons in full as they were adopted by the Fathers in the city of Nice; and I ask of you that your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod would have me much in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The subscription. May our God keep your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, as we desire, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren.</p>

<h3>Canon 137. (Continuation of the last in the Greek.)</h3>

<p> <em>Here begin the examples of the Nicene Council, sent on the sixth day before the calends of December in the year 419</em>,  <em>after the consulate of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> emperor Honorius for the XII th time, and Theodosius for the IX th time</em>,  <em>Augustuses, to Boniface the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the City of Rome.</em></p>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one God etc....the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a> them. </p>

<p>To this <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> there were also annexed copies of the statutes of the same Nicene Councils from the aforenamed pontiffs, in all respects as are contained above; which we do not think it necessary to write out here again.</p>

<h3>Canon 138. (Not numbered in the Greek.)</h3>

<p><strong>Here begins the epistle of the African synod to Pope Celestine, bishop of the City of Rome</strong></p>

<p>To the lord and most beloved and our <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> brother Celestine, Aurelius, Palatinus, Antony, Totus, Servusdei, Terentius, Fortunatus, Martin, Januarius, Optatus, Ceticius, Donatus, Theasius, Vincent, Fortunatian, and the rest of us, assembled at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> in the General Council of Africa.</p>

<p>We could wish that, like as your Holiness intimated to us, in your letter sent by our fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Leo, your pleasure at the arrival of Apiarius, so we also could send to you these writings with pleasure respecting his clearing. Then in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> both our own satisfaction, and yours of late would be more reasonable; nor would that lately expressed by you concerning the hearing of him then to come, as well as that already past, seem hasty and inconsiderate. Upon the arrival, then, of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Faustinus, we assembled a council, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that he was sent with that man, in order that, as he [Apiarius] had before been restored to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbyterate</a> by his assistance, so now he might with his exertions be cleared of the very great crimes charged against him by the inhabitants of Tabraca. But the due course of examination in our council discovered in him such great and monstrous crimes as to overbear even Faustinus, who acted rather as an advocate of the aforementioned person than as a judge, and to prevail against what was more the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of a defender, than the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of an inquirer. For first he vehemently opposed the whole assembly, inflicting on us many injuries, under pretence of asserting the privileges of the Roman Church, and wishing that he should be received into communion by us, on the ground that your Holiness, believing him to have appealed, though unable to prove it, had restored him to communion. But this we by no means allowed, as you will also better see by reading the acts. After however, a most laborious inquiry carried on for three days, during which in the greatest affliction we took cognizance of various charges against him, God the just Judge, strong and long suffering, cut short by a sudden stroke both the delays of our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Faustinus and the evasions of Apiarius himself, by which he was endeavouring to veil his foul enormities. For his strong and shameless obstinacy was overcome, by which he endeavoured to cover, through an impudent denial, the mire of his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and God so wrought upon his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and published, even to the eyes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the secret crimes which he was already condemning in that man's heart, a very sty of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that, after his false denial he suddenly burst forth into a confession of all the crimes he was charged with, and at length convicted himself of his own accord of all infamies beyond belief, and changed to groans even the hope we had entertained, believing and desiring that he might be cleared from such shameful blots, except indeed that it was so far a relief to our sorrow, that he had delivered us from the labour of a longer inquiry, and by confession had applied some sort of remedy to his own wounds, though, lord and brother, it was unwilling, and done with a struggling <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Premising, therefore, our due regards to you, we earnestly conjure you, that for the future you do not readily admit to a hearing <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> coming hence, nor choose to receive to your communion those who have been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by us, because you, venerable Sir, will readily perceive that this has been prescribed even by the Nicene council. For though this seems to be there forbidden in respect of the inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, how much more did it will this to be observed in the case of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, lest those who had been suspended from communion in their own Province might seem to be restored to communion hastily or unfitly by your Holiness. Let your Holiness reject, as is worthy of you, that unprincipled taking shelter with you of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> likewise, and the inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, both because by no ordinance of the Fathers has the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Africa been deprived of this authority, and the Nicene decrees have most plainly committed not only the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of inferior rank, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves to their own Metropolitans. For they have ordained with great wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that all matters should be terminated in the places where they arise; and did not think that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> would be wanting to any Province, for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Christ (<em>Sacerdotibus</em>) wisely to discern, and firmly to maintain the right: especially since whosoever thinks himself wronged by any judgment may appeal to the council of his Province, or even to a General Council [i.e. of Africa] unless it be imagined that God can inspire a single individual with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and refuse it to an innumerable multitude of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (<em>sacerdotum</em>) assembled in council. And how shall we be able to rely on a sentence passed beyond the sea, since it will not be possible to send there the necessary witnesses, whether from the weakness of sex, or advanced age, or any other impediment? For that your Holiness should send any on your part we can find ordained by no council of Fathers. Because with regard to what you have sent us by the same our brother <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Faustinus, as being contained in the Nicene Council, we can find nothing of the kind in the more authentic copies of that council, which we have received from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Cyril our brother, Bishop of the Alexandrine Church, and from the venerable Atticus the Prelate of Constantinople, and which we formerly sent by Innocent the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and Marcellus the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> through whom we received them, to Boniface the Bishop, your predecessor of venerable memory. Moreover whoever desires you to delegate any of your <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to execute your orders, do not comply, lest it seem that we are introducing the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of secular dominion into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which exhibits to all that desire to see God the light of simplicity and the day of humility. For now that the miserable Apiarius has been removed out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for his horrible crimes, we feel confident respecting our brother Faustinus, that through the uprightness and moderation of your Holiness, Africa, without violating brotherly charity, will by no means have to endure him any longer. Lord and brother, may our Lord long preserve your Holiness to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us. </p>
