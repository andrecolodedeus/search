<h1>Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451)</h1>

<p><strong>(Extracts from the Acts)</strong></p>

<h2>Session I</h2>

<p>Paschasinus, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and legate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, stood up in the midst with his most reverend colleagues and said: We received directions at the hands of the most blessed and apostolic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Roman city, which is the head of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, which directions say that Dioscorus is not to be allowed a seat in this assembly, but that if he should attempt to take his seat he is to be cast out. This instruction we must carry out; if now your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> so commands let him be expelled or else we leave. </p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and the full senate said: What special charge do you prefer against the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Dioscorus?</p>

<p>Paschasinus, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and legate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, said: Since he has come, it is necessary that objection be made to him.</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and the whole senate said: In accordance with what has been said, let the charge under which he lies, be specifically made.</p>

<p>Lucentius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> having the place of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, said: Let him give a reason for his judgment. For he undertook to give sentence against one over whom he had no jurisdiction. And he dared to hold a synod without the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, a thing which had never taken place nor can take place. </p>

<p>Paschasinus the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, holding the place of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, said: We cannot go counter to the decrees of the most blessed and apostolic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> [<q>Pope</q> for <q><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a></q> in the Latin], who governs the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, nor against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> canons nor the patristic traditions.</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and the full senate, said: It is proper that you should set forth specifically in what he has gone astray.</p>

<p>Lucentius, the venerable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and holding the place of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, said: We will not suffer so great a wrong to be done us and you, as that he who has come to be judged should sit down [as one to give judgment].</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and the whole senate said: If you hold the office of judge, you ought not to defend yourself as if you were to be judged.</p>

<p>And when Dioscorus the most religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria at the bidding of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and of the sacred assembly (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x1F31;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1FB6;&#x03C2; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03B3;&#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x1F75;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;</span> ) had sat down in the midst, and the most reverend <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman bishops</a> also had sat down in their proper places, and kept silence, Eusebius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Doryl&aelig;um, stepping into the midst, said:</p>

<p>[<em>He then presented a petition, and the Acts of the Latrocinium were read. Also the Acts of the council of Constantinople under Flavian against Eutyches</em> (col. 175).]</p>

<p>And when they were read, the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and immense assembly (<span class="greek">&#x1F51;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03C6;&#x03C5;&#x1F74;&#x03C2; &#x03C3;&#x1F7B;&#x03B3;&#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) said: What do the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the present <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod say? When he thus expounded the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> did Flavian, of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, preserve the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and catholic religion, or did he in any respect <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> concerning it?</p>

<p>Paschasinus the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, representing the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, said; Flavian of blessed memory has most holily and perfectly expounded the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and exposition agrees with the epistle of the most blessed and apostolic man, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>.</p>

<p>Anatolius the most reverend <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Constantinople said; The blessed Flavian  has beautifully and orthodoxly set forth the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of our fathers.</p>

<p>Lucentius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and legate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, said; Since the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Flavian of blessed memory agrees with the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> and the tradition of the fathers it is just that the sentence by which he was condemned by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be turned back upon them by this most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod.</p>

<p>Maximus the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, said: Archbishop Flavian of blessed memory has set forth the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> orthodoxly and in accordance with the most beloved-of-God and most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Archbishop Leo. And this we all receive with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>.</p>

<p>Thalassius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia said; Flavian of blessed memory has spoken in accordance with Cyril of blessed memory.</p>

<p>[<em>And so, one after another, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> expressed their opinions. The reading of the acts of the Council of Constantinople was then continued</em>.]</p>

<p>And at this point of the reading, Dioscorus, the most reverend Archbishop of Alexandria said, I receive <q>the of two;</q> <q>the two</q> I do not receive (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x1F10;&#x03BA; &#x03B4;&#x1F7B;&#x03BF; &#x03B4;&#x1F73;&#x03C7;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;<!--k29--&#183; &#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x03B4;&#x1F7B;&#x03BF;, &#x03BF;&#x1F50; &#x03B4;&#x1F73;&#x03C7;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>). I am forced to be impudent, but the matter is one which touches my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>[<em>After a few remarks the reading was continued and the rest of the acts of the Latrocinium of Ephesus completed. The judges then postponed to the morrow the setting forth a decree on the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> but intimated that Dioscorus and his associates should suffer the punishment to which they <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> sentenced Flavian. This met with the approval of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> except those of Illyrica who said: <q>We all have erred, let us all be pardoned.</q></em> (col. 323.)]</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and the whole senate said; Let each one of the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the present synod, hasten to set forth how he believes, writing without any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but placing the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God before his eyes; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that our most divine and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord believes according to the ecthesis of the three hundred and eighteen <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers at Nice, and according to the ecthesis of the one hundred and fifty after them, and according to the Canonical epistles and ectheses of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers Gregory, Basil, Athanasius, Hilary, Ambrose, and according to the two canonical epistles of Cyril, which were confirmed and published in the first Council of Ephesus, nor does he in any point depart from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the same. For the most reverend <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Old Rome, Leo, appears to have sent a letter to Flavian of blessed memory, with reference to Eutyches's unbelieving <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> which was springing up against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>End of the first Actio.</p>

<h2>Session II</h2>

<p>When all were seated before the rails of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar, the most superb and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and the great (<span class="greek">&#x1F51;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03C6;&#x03C5;&#x1F74;&#x03C2;</span>) senate said; At a former meeting the question was examined of the condemnation of the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Flavian of blessed memory and Eusebius, and it was patent to you all with what <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and accuracy the examination was conducted: and it was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that they had been cruelly and improperly condemned. What course we should pursue in this matter became clear after your deliberations. Now however the question to be enquired into, studied, and decided, is how the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to be established, which is the chief end for which this Council has been assembled. As we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are to render to God a strict account not only for your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in particular, but as well for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all of us who desire rightly to be taught all things that pertain to religion, and that all ambiguity be taken away, by the agreement and consent of all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers, and by their united exposition and doctrine; hasten therefore without any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of pleasing or displeasing, to set forth (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BA;&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) the pure <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that they who do not seem to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> with all the rest, may be brought to unity through the acknowledging of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For we wish you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the most divine and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord of the whole world and ourselves hold the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> set forth by the 318 and by the 150 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers, and what also has been taught by the rest of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> fathers, and in accordance with this is our belief.</p>

<p>The most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried; Any other setting forth (<span class="greek">&#x1F14;&#x03BA;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BD; &#x1F04;&#x03BB;&#x03BB;&#x03B7;&#x03BD;</span>) no one makes, neither will we attempt it, neither will we dare to set forth [anything new] (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BA;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>). For the fathers taught, and in their writings are preserved, what things were set forth by them, and further than this we can say nothing.</p>

<p>Cecropius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Sebastopol said: The matters concerning Eutyches have been examined, and the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Rome has given a form (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) which we follow and to his letter we all [i.e. those in his neighbourhood] have subscribed.</p>

<p>The most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried: These are the opinions of all of us. The expositions (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>) already made are quite sufficient: it is not lawful to make any other.</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and great senate said, If it pleases your reverence, let the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patriarch of each province, choosing one or two of his own province and going into the midst, and together considering the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all what is agreed upon. So that if, as we desire, all be of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, all ambiguity may be removed: But if some entertain contrary opinions (which we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be the case) we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what their opinions are.</p>

<p>The most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out, we make no new exposition in writing. This is the law, [i.e. of the Third Synod] which teaches that what has been set forth is sufficient. The law wills that no other exposition should be made. Let the sayings of the Fathers remain fast.</p>

<p>Florentius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13472a.htm">Sardis</a>, said, since it is not possible for those who follow the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod of Nice, which was confirmed rightly and piously at Ephesus, to draw up suddenly a declaration of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers Cyril and Celestine, and of the letter of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Leo, we therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> your magnificence to give us time, so that we may be able to arrive at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the matter with a fitting document, although so far as we are concerned, who have subscribed the letter of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Leo, nothing further is needed.</p>

<p>Cecropius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Sebastopol, said, The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has been well defined by the 318 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers and confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers Athanasius, Cyril, Celestine, Hilary, Basil, Gregory, and now once again by the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Leo: and we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that those things which were decreed by the 318 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers, and by the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Leo be read.</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and great Senate said: Let there be read the expositions (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>) of the 318 fathers gathered together at Nice.</p>

<p>Eunomius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> read from a book [the Exposition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the 318 fathers. ]</p>

<p> <em>The Exposition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Council held at Nice.</em></p>

<p><q>In the consulate of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Julian</q> etc.</p>

<p><q>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> etc.</p>

<p><q>But those who say,</q> etc.</p>

<p>The most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out; This is the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; this we all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: into this we were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; into this we <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>: Blessed Cyril so taught: this is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: this is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: this is the everlasting <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: into this we were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: into this we <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>: we all so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: so believes Leo, the Pope (<span class="greek">&#x1F41; &#x03C0;&#x1F71;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>): Cyril thus <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: Pope Leo so interpreted it.</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and great senate said, Let there be read what was set forth by the 150 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers.</p>

<p>A&euml;tius, the reverend <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Constantinople read from a book [the creed of the 150 fathers. ]</p>

<p> <em>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which the</em> 150 <em>fathers set forth as consonant to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and great Synod of Nice.</em></p>

<p><q>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> etc.</p>

<p>All the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out: This is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of all of us: we all so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<p>The reverend archdeacon A&euml;tius said, There remains the letter of Cyril of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed memory, sometime <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the great city Alexandria, which he wrote to <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, which was approved by all the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled in the first Council at Ephesus, called to condemn the same <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, and which was confirmed by the subscription of all. There is also another letter of the same Cyril, of blessed memory, which he wrote to John, of blessed memory, sometime <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the great city of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, which likewise was confirmed. If it be so ordered, I shall read these.</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and great senate said, Let the letters of Cyril of blessed memory be read.</p>

<p>A&euml;tius, the Archdeacon of the imperial city Constantinople read.</p>

<p>Cyril to my lord, beloved brother, and fellow minister John, greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p><q>Let the heavens <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and let the earth be glad</q> for the middle wall of partition has been taken away, and grief has been silenced, and all kind of difference of opinion has been removed; Christ the Saviour of us all having awarded peace to his churches, through our being called to this by our most devout and beloved of God kings, who are the best imitators of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of their ancestors in keeping the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> firm and immovable, for they chiefly give their mind to the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Churches, in order that they may have the noted <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> forever and show forth their most renowned kingdom, to whom also Christ himself the Lord of powers distributes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things with plenteous hand and gives to prevail over their enemies and grants them victory. For he does not lie in saying: <q>As I live says the Lord, them that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> me, I will <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</q> For when my lord, my most-beloved-of-<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fellow-minister and brother <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, had arrived in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, we were filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, and most naturally at the coming of such a man as a mediator, who was ready to work beyond measure that he might overcome the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and heal our divisions, and who by removing the offenses scattered between us, would crown your Church and ours with harmony and peace.</p>

<p>Of the reason of the disagreement it is superfluous to speak. I deem it more useful both to think and speak of things suitable to the time of peace. We were therefore delighted at meeting with that distinguished and most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man, who expected perhaps to have no small struggle, persuading us that it is necessary to form an alliance for the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to drive away the laughter of the heterodox, and for this end to blunt the goads of the stubbornness of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. He found us ready for this, so as absolutely to need no labour to be bestowed upon us. For we remembered the Saviour's saying; <q>My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave with you.</q> We have been taught also to say in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>: <q>O Lord our God give us peace, for you have given us all things.</q> So that if anyone should be in the participation of the peace furnished from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he is not lacking in any good. That as a matter of fact, the disagreement of the Churches happened altogether unnecessarily and inopportunely, we now have been fully satisfied by the document brought by my lord, the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, which contains an unimpeachable confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and this he asserted to have been prepared, by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and by the God-beloved Bishops there. The document is as follows, and is set down verbatim in this our epistle.</p>

<p>Concerning the Virgin <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, we thus think and speak; and of the manner of the Incarnation of the Only Begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, necessarily, not by way of addition but for the sake of certainty, as we have received from the beginning from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> and from the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers, we will speak briefly, adding nothing whatever to the Faith set forth by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers in Nice. For, as we said before, it suffices for all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and the refutation of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But we speak, not presuming on the impossible; but with the confession of our own weakness, excluding those who wish us to cling to those things which transcend <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> consideration.</p>

<p>We confess, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Only Begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and perfect Man of a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh consisting; begotten before the ages of the Father according to his Divinity, and in the last days, for us and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary the Virgin</a> according to his humanity, of the same substance with his Father according to his Divinity, and of the same substance with us according to his humanity; for there became a union of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. Wherefore we confess one Christ, one Son, one Lord.</p>

<p>According to this understanding of this unmixed union, we confess the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin to be <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>; because <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was incarnate and became Man, and from this conception he united the temple taken from her with himself.</p>

<p>For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the theologians make some things of the Evangelical and Apostolic teaching about the Lord common as pertaining to the one person, and other things they divide as to the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, and attribute the worthy ones to God on account of the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the lowly ones on account of his humanity [to his humanity].</p>

<p>These being your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> voices, and finding ourselves thinking the same with them (<q>One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism,</q>) we <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> God the Saviour of all, congratulating one another that our churches and yours have the Faith which agrees with the God-inspired Scriptures and the traditions of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers.</p>

<p>Since I learned that certain of those accustomed to find fault were humming around like vicious wasps, and vomiting out wretched words against me, as that I say the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was brought from heaven, and not of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin, I thought it necessary to say a few words concerning this to them:</p>

<p>O fools, and only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how to misrepresent, how have you been led to such a judgment, how have you fallen into so foolish a sickness? For it is necessary, it is undoubtedly necessary, to understand that almost all the opposition to us concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, arose from our affirming that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin is <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. But if from heaven and not from her the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Body of the Saviour of all was born, how then is she understood to be <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>? What then did she bring forth except it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that she brought forth the <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> according to the flesh? They are to be laughed at who babble such things about me. For the blessed <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah does not lie in saying <q>Behold the Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call his name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, which being interpreted is God with us.</q> Truly also the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Gabriel said to the Blessed Virgin: <q>Fear not, Mary, for you have found favour with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a Son, and shall call his name Jesus. He shall save his people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q></p>

<p>For when we say <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> descended from heaven, and from above, we do not so say this as if from above and from heaven was his Holy Flesh taken, but rather by way of following the divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who distinctly declares: <q>the first man is of the earth, earthy; the Second Man is the Lord from heaven.</q></p>

<p>We remember too, the Saviour himself saying, <q>And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>.</q> Although he was born according to his flesh, as just said, of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin, yet <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> came down from above and from heaven. He <q>made himself of no <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, and took upon him the form of a servant,</q> and was called the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, yet remaining what he was, that is to say God. For he is unchanging and unchangeable according to nature; considered already as one with his own Flesh, he is said to have come down from heaven.</p>

<p>He is also called the Man from heaven, being perfect in his Divinity and perfect in his Humanity, and considered as in one Person. For one is the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, although the difference of his natures is not unknown, from which we say the ineffable union was made.</p>

<p>Will your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> vouchsafe to silence those who say that a crasis, or mingling or mixture took place between the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> and flesh. For it is likely that certain also gossip about me as having thought or said such things.</p>

<p>But I am far from any such thought as that, and I also consider them wholly to rave who think a shadow of change could occur concerning the Nature of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. For he remains that which he always was, and has not been changed, nor can he ever be changed, nor is he capable of change. For we all confess in addition to this, that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is impassible, even though when he dispenses most wisely this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, he appears to ascribe to himself the sufferings endured in his own flesh. To the same purpose the all-wise Peter also said when he wrote of Christ as having <q>suffered in the flesh,</q> and not in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his ineffable godhead. In order that he should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be the Saviour of all, by an economic appropriation to himself, as just said, he assumed the sufferings of his own Flesh.</p>

<p>Like to this is the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> through the voice of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, as from him, <q>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</q> Let your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> be convinced nor let anyone else be doubtful that we altogether follow the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers, especially of our blessed and celebrated Father Athanasius, deprecating the least departure from it.</p>

<p>I might have added many quotations from them also establishing my words, but that it would have added to the length of my letter and it might become wearisome. And we will allow the defined Faith, the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the Faith set forth by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers who assembled some time ago at Nice, to be shaken by no one. Nor would we permit ourselves or others, to alter a single word of those set forth, or to add one syllable, remembering the saying: <q>Remove not the ancient landmark which your fathers have set,</q> for it was not they who spoke but the Spirit himself of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who proceeds also from him, and is not alien from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, according to his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. And this the words of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> initiators into <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> confirm to us. For in the Acts of the Apostles it is written: <q>And after they had come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; but the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> suffered them not.</q> And the divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wrote: <q>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if so be that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is none of his.</q></p>

<p>When some of those who are accustomed to turn from the right, twist my speech to their views, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> not to wonder; but be well assured that the followers of every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> gather the occasions of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from the God-inspired Scriptures, corrupting in their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> minds the things rightly said through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and drawing down upon their own heads the unquenchable flame.</p>

<p>Since we have learned that certain, after having corrupted it, have set forth the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> epistle of our most distinguished Father Athanasius to the Blessed Epictetus, so as thereby to injure many; therefore it appeared to the brethren to be useful and necessary that we should send to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> a copy of it from some correct ancient transcripts which exist among us. Farewell.</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and the great senate said: Let there be read also the epistle of the most worthy Leo, Archbishop of Old Rome, the Imperial City.</p>

<p>Beronician, the most devout clerk of the sacred consistory, read from a book handed him by A&euml;tius, Archdeacon of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church of Constantinople, the encyclical or synodical letter of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Leo, the Archbishop, written to Flavian, Archbishop of Constantinople.</p>

<blockquote><p> <em>The Tome of St. Leo.</em></p>

<p>(Labbe and Cossart, <em>Concilia</em>, Tom. IV., col. 343; also Migne, <em>Pat. Lat</em>., Tom. LIV. [Leo. M. <em>Opera</em>, Tom. I.] col. 756.) </p>

<p>Leo [the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>] to his [most] dear brother Flavian.</p>

<p>Having read your Affection's letter, the late arrival of which is matter of surprise to us, and having gone through the record of the proceedings of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, we have now, at last, gained a clear view of the scandal which has risen up among you, against the integrity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and what at first seemed obscure has now been elucidated and explained. By this means Eutyches, who seemed to be deserving of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> under the title of Presbyter, is now shown to be exceedingly thoughtless and sadly inexperienced, so that to him also we may apply the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> words, <q>He refused to understand in order to act well: he meditated unrighteousness on his bed.</q> What, indeed, is more unrighteous than to entertain ungodly thoughts, and not to yield to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> wiser and more learned? But into this folly do they fall who, when hindered by some obscurity from apprehending the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, have recourse, not to the words of the Prophets, not to the letters of the Apostles, nor to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, but to themselves; and become teachers of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, just because they have not been <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For what learning has he received from the sacred pages of the New and the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, who does not so much as understand the very beginning of the Creed? And that which, all the world over, is uttered by the voices of all applicants for regeneration, is still not grasped by the mind of this aged man. If, then, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what he ought to think about the Incarnation of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and was not willing, for the sake of obtaining the light of intelligence, to make laborious search through the whole extent of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, he should at least have received with heedful attention that general Confession common to all, whereby the whole body of the faithful profess that they <q><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty, and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> his only Son our Lord, who was born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and the Virgin Mary.</q> By which three clauses the engines of almost all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are shattered. For when God is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be both <q>Almighty</q> and <q>Father,</q> it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the Son is everlasting together with himself, differing in nothing from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because he was born as <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> Almighty from Almighty, Coeternal from Eternal; not later in time, not inferior in power, not unlike him in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, not divided from him in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but the same Only-begotten and Everlasting Son of an Everlasting Parent was <q>born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and the Virgin Mary.</q> This birth in time in no way detracted from, in no way added to, that divine and everlasting birth; but expended itself wholly in the work of restoring man, who had been deceived; so that it might both overcome death, and by its power <q>destroy the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who had the power of death.</q> For we could not have overcome the author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of death, unless he who could neither be contaminated by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor detained by death, had taken upon himself our nature, and made it his own. For, in fact, he was <q>conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></q> within the womb of a Virgin Mother, who bore him as she had conceived him, without loss of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.  But if he (Eutyches) was not able to obtain a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conception from this pure fountain of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> because by his own blindness he had darkened for himself the brightness of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> so clear, he should have submitted himself to the Evangelist's teaching; and after reading what Matthew says, <q>The book of the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Son of David, the Son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,</q> he should also have sought instruction from the Apostle's preaching; and after reading in the Epistle to the Romans, <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, called an Apostle, separated unto the gospel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he had promised before by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, concerning his Son, who was made unto him of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh,</q> he should have bestowed some devout study on the pages of the Prophets; and finding that God's promise said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <q>in your seed shall all nations be blessed,</q> in order to avoid all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the proper meaning of this <q>seed,</q> he should have attended to the Apostle's words, <q>To <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and to his seed were the promises made. He says not, 'and to seeds,' as in the case of many, but as in the case of one, 'and to your seed,' which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> He should also have apprehended with his inward ear the declaration of Isaiah, <q>Behold, a Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and they shall call his name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, which is, being interpreted, God with us;</q> and should have read with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the words of the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>Unto us a Child has been born, unto us a Son has been given, whose power is on his shoulder; and they shall call his name Angel of great counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, Strong <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Prince of Peace, Father of the age to come.</q> And he should not have spoken idly to the effect that the Word was in such a sense made flesh, that the Christ who was brought forth from the Virgin's womb had the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and had not a body really derived from his Mother's body. Possibly his reason for thinking that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> was not of our nature was this&mdash; that the Angel who was sent to the blessed and ever Virgin Mary said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you, and therefore also that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing which shall be born of you shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</q> as if, because the Virgin's conception was caused by a divine act, therefore the flesh of him whom she conceived was not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of her who conceived him. But we are not to understand that <q>generation,</q> peerlessly wonderful, and wonderfully peerless, in such a sense as that the newness of the mode of production did away with the proper character of the kind. For it was the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> who gave fecundity to the Virgin, but it was from a body that a real body was derived; and <q>when Wisdom was building herself a house,</q> the <q><a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt among us,</q> that is, in that flesh which he assumed from a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, and which he animated with the spirit of rational life.</p>

<p>Accordingly while the distinctness of both natures and substances was preserved, and both met in one Person, lowliness was assumed by majesty, weakness by power, mortality by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; and, in order to pay the debt of our condition, the inviolable nature was united to the passible, so that as the appropriate remedy for our ills, one and the same <q>Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>,</q> might from one element be capable of dying and also from the other be incapable. Therefore in the entire and perfect nature of very man was born very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whole in what was his, whole in what was ours. By <q>ours</q> we mean what the Creator formed in us at the beginning and what he assumed in order to restore; for of that which the deceiver brought in, and man, thus deceived, admitted, there was not a trace in the Saviour; and the fact that he took on himself a share in our infirmities did not make him a partaker in our transgressions. He assumed <q>the form of a servant</q> without the defilement of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, enriching what was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, not impairing what was divine: because that <q>emptying of himself,</q> whereby the Invisible made himself visible, and the Creator and Lord of all things willed to be one among mortals, was a stooping down in compassion, not a failure of power. Accordingly, the same who, remaining in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, made man, was made man in the form of a servant. For each of the natures retains its proper character without defect; and as the form of God does not take away the form of a servant, so the form of a servant does not impair the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For since the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was glorying in the fact that man, deceived by his craft, was bereft of divine gifts and, being stripped of his endowment of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, had come under the grievous sentence of death, and that he himself, amid his miseries, had found a sort of consolation in having a transgressor as his companion, and that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the requirements of the principle of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, had changed his own resolution in regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whom he had created in so high a position of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; there was need of a dispensation of secret counsel, in order that the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose will could not be deprived of its own benignity, should fulfil by a more secret <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> his original plan of loving kindness toward us, and that man, who had been led into fault by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> subtlety of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, should not perish contrary to God's purpose. Accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, descending from his seat in heaven, and not departing from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, enters this lower world, born after a new order, by a new mode of birth. After a new order; because he who in his own sphere is invisible, became visible in ours; He who could not be enclosed in space, willed to be enclosed; continuing to be before times, he began to exist in time; the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> allowed his <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> majesty to be overshadowed, and took upon him the form of a servant; the impassible God did not disdain to be passible Man and the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> One to be subjected to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of death. And born by a new mode of birth; because inviolate <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, while <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of concupiscence, supplied the matter of his flesh. What was assumed from the Lord's mother was nature, not fault; nor does the wondrousness of the nativity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, as born of a Virgin's womb, imply that his nature is unlike ours. For the selfsame who is very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is also very man; and there is no illusion in this union, while the lowliness of man and the loftiness of Godhead meet together. For as <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></q> is not changed by the compassion [exhibited], so <q>Man</q> is not consumed by the dignity [bestowed]. For each <q>form</q> does the acts which belong to it, in communion with the other; the Word, that is, performing what belongs to the Word, and the flesh carrying out what belongs to the flesh; the one of these shines out in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the other succumbs to injuries. And as the Word does not withdraw from equality with the Father in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, so the flesh does not abandon the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of our kind. For, as we must often be saying, he is one and the same, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as <q>in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q> Man, inasmuch as <q>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt among us.</q> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as <q>all things were made by him, and without him nothing was made.</q> Man, inasmuch as he was <q>made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law.</q> The nativity of the flesh is a manifestation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; the Virgin's child-bearing is an indication of Divine power. The infancy of the Babe is exhibited by the humiliation of swaddling clothes: the greatness of the Highest is declared by the voices of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. He whom <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> impiously designs to slay is like humanity in its beginnings; but he whom the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to adore on their knees is Lord of all. Now when he came to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John his forerunner, lest the fact that the Godhead was covered with a veil of flesh should be concealed, the voice of the Father spoke in thunder from heaven, <q>This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased.</q> Accordingly, he who, as man, is tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> subtlety, is the same to whom, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> pay duteous service. To hunger, to thirst, to be weary, and to sleep, is evidently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. But to satisfy five thousand men with five loaves, and give to the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that living water, to draw which can secure him that drinks of it from ever thirsting again; to walk on the surface of the sea with feet that sink not, and by rebuking the storm to bring down the <q>uplifted waves,</q> is unquestionably Divine. As then&mdash; to pass by many points &mdash; it does not belong to the same nature to weep with feelings of pity over a dead friend and, after the mass of stone had been removed from the grave where he had lain four days, by a voice of command to raise him up to life again; or to hang on the wood, and to make all the elements tremble after daylight had been turned into night; or to be transfixed with nails, and to open the gates of paradise to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the robber; so it does not belong to the same nature to say, <q>I and the Father are one,</q> and to say, <q>the Father is greater than I.</q> For although in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> there is one Person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet that whereby contumely attaches to both is one thing, and that whereby <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> attaches to both is another; for from what belongs to us he has that manhood which is inferior to the Father; while from the Father he has equal Godhead with the Father. Accordingly, on account of this unity of Person which is to be understood as existing in both the natures, we read, on the one hand, that <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> came down from heaven,</q> inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> took flesh from that Virgin of whom he was born; and on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is said to have been crucified and buried, inasmuch as he underwent this, not in his actual Godhead; wherein the Only-begotten is coeternal and consubstantial with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but in the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore we all, in the very Creed, confess that <q>the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was crucified and buried,</q> according to that saying of the Apostle, <q>for if they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Majesty.</q></p>

<p>But when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour</a> himself was by his questions instructing the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, he said, <q>Whom do men say that I the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> am?</q> And when they had mentioned various opinions held by others, he said, <q>But whom do you say that I am?</q> that is, <q>I who am <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and whom you see in the form of a servant, and in reality of flesh, whom do you say that I am?</q> Whereupon the blessed Peter, as inspired by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and about to benefit all nations by his confession, said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God.</q> Not undeservedly, therefore, was he pronounced blessed by the Lord, and derived from the original Rock that solidity which belonged both to his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and to his name, who through revelation from the Father confessed the selfsame to be both the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and the Christ; because one of these truths, accepted without the other, would not profit unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and it was equally dangerous to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> to be merely God and not man, or merely man and not God. But after the resurrection of the Lord&mdash; which was in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the resurrection of a real body, for no other person was raised again than he who had been crucified and had died&mdash; what else was accomplished during that interval of forty days than to make our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> entire and clear of all darkness? For while he conversed with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and dwelt with them, and ate with them, and allowed himself to be handled with careful and inquisitive touch by those who were under the influence of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, for this end he came in to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when the doors were shut, and by his breath gave them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and opened the secrets of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> after bestowing on them the light of intelligence, and again in his selfsame person showed to them the wound in the side, the prints of the nails, and all the flesh tokens of the Passion, saying, <q>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have:</q> that the properties of the Divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> might be acknowledged to remain in him without causing a division, and that we might in such sort <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Word is not what the flesh is, as to confess that the one <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is both Word and flesh. On which <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> this Eutyches must be regarded as unhappily having no hold, who does not recognise our nature to exist in the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, either by way of the lowliness of mortality, or of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of resurrection. Nor has he been overawed by the declaration of the blessed Apostle and Evangelist John, saying, <q>Every spirit that confesses that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and every spirit which dissolves Jesus is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>.</q> Now what is to dissolve <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, but to separate the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from him, and to make void by shameless inventions that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> by which alone we have been saved? Moreover, being in the dark as to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, he must needs be involved in the like senseless blindness with regard to his Passion also. For if he does not think the Lord's crucifixion to be unreal, and does not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he really accepted suffering, even unto death, for the sake of the world's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; as he believes in his death, let him acknowledge his flesh also, and not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he whom he recognises as having been capable of suffering is also Man with a body like ours; since to deny his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh is also to deny his bodily sufferings. If then he accepts the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and does not turn away his ear from the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, let him see what nature it was that was transfixed with nails and hung on the wood of the cross; and let him understand whence it was that, after the side of the Crucified had been pierced by the soldier's spear, blood and water flowed out, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> might be refreshed both with a Laver and with a Cup. Let him listen also to the blessed Apostle Peter when he declares, that <q>sanctification by the Spirit</q> takes place through the <q>sprinkling of the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> and let him not give a mere cursory reading to the words of the same Apostle, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain way of life received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot.</q> Let him also not resist the testimony of Blessed John the Apostle, <q>And the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> cleanses us from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> And again, <q>This is the victory which overcomes the world, even our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</q> and, <q>who is he that overcomes the world, but he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? This is he that came by water and blood, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; not in water only, but in water and blood; and it is the Spirit that bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, because the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For there are three that bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the water, and the blood; and the three are one.</q> That is, the Spirit of sanctification, and the blood of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, and the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; which three things are one, and remain undivided, and not one of them is disjoined from connection with the others; because the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> lives and advances by this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that Christ Jesus we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> neither manhood to exist without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead, nor Godhead without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> manhood. But when Eutyches, on being questioned in your examination of him, answered, <q>I confess that our Lord was of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> before the union, but after the union I confess one nature;</q> I am astonished that so absurd and perverse a profession as this of his was not rebuked by a censure on the part of any of his judges, and that an utterance extremely foolish and extremely <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> was passed over, just as if nothing had been heard which could give offense: seeing that it is as impious to say that the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> before the Incarnation as it is shocking to affirm that, since the Word became flesh, there has been in him one nature only. But lest Eutyches should think that what he said was correct, or was tolerable, because it was not confuted by any assertion of yours, we exhort your earnest solicitude, dearly beloved brother, to see that, if by God's merciful inspiration the case is brought to a satisfactory issue, the inconsiderate and inexperienced man be cleansed also from this pestilent notion of his; seeing that, as the record of the proceedings has clearly shown, he had fairly begun to abandon his own opinion when on being driven into a corner by authoritative words of yours, he professed himself ready to say what he had not said before, and to give his adhesion to that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from which he had previously stood aloof. But when he would not consent to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> the impious dogma you understood, brother, that he continued in his own misbelief, and deserved to receive sentence of condemnation. For which if he grieves sincerely and to good purpose, and understands, even though too late, how properly the Episcopal authority has been put in motion, or if, in order to make full satisfaction, he shall condemn <em>viva voce</em>, and under his own hand, all that he has held amiss, no compassion, to whatever extent, which can be shown him when he has been set right, will be worthy of blame, for our Lord, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and good Shepherd, who laid down his life for his sheep, and who came to save men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and not to destroy them, wills us to imitate his own loving kindness; so that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> should indeed constrain those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but mercy should not reject those who are converted. For then indeed is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> defended with the best results, when a false opinion is condemned even by those who have followed it. But in order that the whole matter may be piously and faithfully carried out, we have appointed our brethren, Julius, Bishop, and Reatus, Presbyter (of the title of St. Clement) and also my son Hilarus, Deacon, to represent us; and with them we have associated Dulcitius, our Notary, of whose fidelity we have had good <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>: trusting that the Divine assistance will be with you, so that he who has gone astray may be saved by condemning his own unsound opinion. May God keep you in good health, dearly beloved brother. Given on the Ides of June, in the Consulate of the illustrious men, Asterius and Protogenes.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Session II (Continued)</h2>

<p>After the reading of the foregoing epistle, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out: This is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the fathers, this is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostles. So we all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, thus the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Anathema to him who does not thus <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> did Leo teach, so taught Cyril. Everlasting be the memory of Cyril. Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> to him who does not so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. This is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Those of us who are <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> thus <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. This is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the fathers. Why were not these things read at Ephesus [i.e. at the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> synod held there]? These are the things Dioscorus hid away.</p>

<p>[<em>Some explanations were asked by the Illyrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the answers were found satisfactory, but yet a delay of a few days was asked for, and some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> petitioned for a general pardon of all who had been kept out. This proposition made great confusion, in the midst of which the session was dissolved by the judges</em>. (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Col. 371.)]</p>

<h2>Session III</h2>

<p>[<em>The imperial representatives do not seem to have been present, and after A&euml;tius the Archdeacon of Constantinople had opened the Session</em>,]</p>

<p>Paschasinus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Lilyb&aelig;um, in the province of Silicia, and holding the place of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Leo, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the Apostolic see of old Rome, said in Latin what being interpreted is as follows: It is well known to this beloved of God synod, that divine  letters were sent to the blessed and apostolic pope Leo, inviting him to deign to be present at the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod. But since ancient custom did not sanction this, nor the general necessity of the time seemed to permit it, our littleness in the place of himself he <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x1F01;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F79;&#x03B4;&#x03BF;&#x03C5; &#x03B5;&#x03C0;&#x1F73;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C8;&#x03B5;</span>, and therefore it is necessary that whatever things are brought into discussion should be examined by our interference (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x1FB6;&#x03C2;</span>). [The Latin reads where I have placed the Greek of the ordinary text, thus, <q>commanded our littleness to preside in his place over this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council.</q>] Therefore let the book presented by our most beloved-of-God brother, and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Eusebius be received, and read by the beloved of God archdeacon and primicerius of the notaries, A&euml;tius.</p>

<p>And A&euml;tius, the archdeacon and primicerius of the notaries, took the book and read as follows.</p>

<p>[<em>Next follows the petition of Eusebius</em> et post nonnulla <em>four petitions each addressed to</em> <q>The most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and beloved-of-God ecumenical <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and patriarch of great Rome Leo, and to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical Synod assembled at Chalcedon, etc., etc.;</q> <em>The first two by <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of Alexandria, the third by a quondam <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the diocese, and the fourth by a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> also of Alexandria. After this Dioscorus was again summoned and, as he did not come, sentence was given against him, which was communicated to him in a letter contained in the acts.</em> (L. and C., <em>Conc</em>., Tom. IV., col. 418.) <em>The Bishops expressed their opinions for the most part one by one, but the Roman Legates spoke together, and in their speech occurs the following</em> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Col. 426:)]</p>

<p>Wherefore the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Leo, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the great and elder Rome, through us, and through this present most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod together with  the thrice blessed and all-<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Peter the Apostle, who is the rock and foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, has stripped him of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, and has alienated from him all hieratic worthiness. Therefore let this most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and great synod sentence the before mentioned Dioscorus to the canonical penalties.</p>

<p>[The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> then, one by one, spoke in favour of the deposition of Dioscorus, but usually on the ground of his refusal to appear when thrice summoned.]</p>

<p>And when all the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had spoken on the subject, they signed this which follows.</p>

<blockquote><p> <em>The Condemnation Sent by the Holy and Ecumenical Synod to Dioscorus.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and great and ecumenical Synod, which by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God according to the constitution of our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and beloved of God emperors assembled together at Chalcedon the city of Bithynia, in the martyry of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and victorious Martyr Euphemia to Dioscorus.</p>

<p>We do you to wit that on the thirteenth day of the month of October you were deposed from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> and made a stranger to all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;</span>) by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical synod, on account of your disregard of the divine canons, and of your disobedience to this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical synod and on account of the other crimes of which you have been found guilty, for even when called to answer your accusers three times by this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and great synod according to the divine canons you did not come.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Session IV</h2>

<p>The most magnificent and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and the great Senate said:</p>

<p>Let the reverend council now declare what seems good concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since those things which have already been disposed of have been made manifest. Paschasinus and Lucentius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and Boniface the most reverend <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, legates of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> through that most reverend man, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Paschasinus said: As the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed and Ecumenical Synod holds fast and follows the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<em>fidei regulam</em> in the Latin Acts) which was set forth by the fathers at Nice, it also confirms the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> set forth by the Synod of 150 fathers gathered at Constantinople at the bidding of the great Theodosius of blessed memory. Moreover the exposition of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of the illustrious Cyril of blessed memory set forth at the Council of Ephesus (in which <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> was condemned) is received. And in the third place the writings of that blessed man, Leo, Archbishop of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, who condemned the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and Eutyches, show what the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is. Likewise the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod holds this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, this it follows&mdash; nothing further can it add nor can it take anything away.</p>

<p>When this had been translated into Greek by Beronician, the devout secretary of the divine consistory, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out: So we all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, so we were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, so we <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, so we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, so we now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and the great senate said: Since we see that the Holy <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> have been placed alongside of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, let each one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> here assembled declare whether the epistle of most blessed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> Leo is in accordance with the exposition of the 318 fathers assembled at Nice and with the decrees of the 150 fathers afterwards assembled in the royal city.</p>

<p>[<em>To this question the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> answered one by one, until 161 separate opinions had been given, when the rest of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were asked by the imperial judges to give their votes in a body</em> (col. 508).]</p>

<p>All the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out: We all acquiesce, we all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> thus; we are all of the same mind. So are we minded, so we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, etc., etc.</p>

<h2>Session V</h2>

<p>Paschasinus and Lucentius the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and Boniface a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, vicars of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> of Rome, said: If they do not agree to the letter of that apostolic and blessed man, Pope Leo, give directions that we be given our letters of dismission, and let a synod be held there [i.e. in the West].</p>

<p>[<em>A long debate then followed as to whether the decree drawn up and presented should be accepted. This seems to have been the mind of most of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. At last the commissioners proposed a committee of twenty-two to meet with them and report to the council, and the Emperor imposed this with the threat that otherwise they all should be sent home and a new council called in the West. Even this did not make them yield</em> (col. 560.)]</p>

<p>The most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out: Many years to the Emperor! Either let the definition [i.e. the one presented at this session] stand or we go. Many years to the Emperor!</p>

<p>Cecropius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Sebastopol, said: We ask that the definition be read again and that those who dissent from it, and will not sign, may go about their business; for we give our consent to these things which have been so beautifully drafted, and make no criticisms.</p>

<p>The most blessed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Illyria said: Let those who contradict be made manifest. Those who contradict are <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. Those who contradict, let them go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<p>The most magnificent and most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges said: Dioscorus acknowledged that he accepted the expression <q>of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>,</q> but not that there were two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. But the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> Leo says that there are two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in Christ unchangeably, inseparably, unconfusedly united in the one only-begotten Son our Saviour. Which would you follow, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Leo or Dioscorus?</p>

<p>The most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out: We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> as Leo. Those who contradict are Eutychians. Leo has rightly expounded the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>The most magnificent and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges said: Add then to the definition, according to the judgment of our most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> father Leo, that there are two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in Christ united unchangeably, inseparably, unconfusedly.</p>

<p>[<em>The Committee then sat in the oratory of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Euphemis and afterwards reported a definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which while teaching the same doctrine was not the Tome of Leo</em> (col. 562).]</p>

<blockquote><p> <em>The Definition of Faith of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, great, and ecumenical synod, assembled by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the command of our most religious and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Emperors, Marcian and Valentinian, Augusti, at Chalcedon, the metropolis of the Bithynian Province, in the martyry of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and victorious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Euphemia, has decreed as follows:</p>

<p>Our Lord and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, when strengthening the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Faith in his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, to the end that no one might disagree with his neighbour concerning the doctrines of religion, and that the proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might be set forth equally to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, said, <q>My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</q> But, since the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one does not desist from sowing tares among the seeds of godliness, but ever invents some new device against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; therefore the Lord, providing, as he ever does, for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, has raised up this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, faithful, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> Sovereign, and has called together unto him from all parts the chief rulers of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; so that, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ our common Lord inspiring us, we may cast off every plague of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> from the sheep of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and feed them with the tender leaves of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And this have we done with one unanimous consent, driving away erroneous doctrines and renewing the unerring <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Fathers, publishing to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the Creed of the Three Hundred and Eighteen, and to their number adding, as their peers, the Fathers who have received the same summary of religion. Such are the One Hundred and Fifty <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers who afterwards assembled in the great Constantinople and ratified the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Moreover, observing the order and every form relating to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which was observed by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod formerly held in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, of which Celestine of Rome and Cyril of Alexandria, of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, were the leaders, we do declare that the exposition of the right and blameless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> made by the Three Hundred and Eighteen <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Fathers, assembled at Nice in the reign of Constantine of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, shall be pre-eminent: and that those things shall be of force also, which were decreed by the One Hundred and Fifty <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers at Constantinople, for the uprooting of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which had then sprung up, and for the confirmation of the same <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Faith of ours.</p>

<p> <em>The Creed of the three hundred and eighteen Fathers at Nice.</em></p>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, etc.</p>

<p> <em>Item</em>, the Creed of the one hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers who were assembled at Constantinople.</p>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>This wise and salutary formula of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> sufficed for the perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and confirmation of religion; for it teaches the perfect [doctrine] concerning Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and sets forth the Incarnation of the Lord to them that faithfully receive it. But, forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> undertaking to make void the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have through their individual <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> given rise to empty babblings; some of them daring to corrupt the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> for us and refusing [to use] the name <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> (<span class="greek">&#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) in reference to the Virgin, while others, bringing in a confusion and mixture, and idly conceiving that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the flesh and of the Godhead is all one, maintaining that the divine Nature of the Only Begotten is, by mixture, capable of suffering; therefore this present <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, great, and ecumenical synod, desiring to exclude every device against the Truth, and teaching that which is unchanged from the beginning, has at the very outset decreed that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Three Hundred and Eighteen Fathers shall be preserved inviolate. And on account of them that contend against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it confirms the doctrine afterwards delivered concerning the substance of the Spirit by the One Hundred and Fifty <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers who assembled in the imperial City; which doctrine they declared unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not as though they were introducing anything that had been lacking in their predecessors, but in order to explain through written documents their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> against those who were seeking to destroy his sovereignty. And, on account of those who have taken in hand to corrupt the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the dispensation [i.e. the Incarnation] and who shamelessly pretend that he who was born of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin Mary was a mere man, it receives the synodical letters of the Blessed Cyril, Pastor of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a>, addressed to <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and the Easterns, judging them suitable, for the refutation of the frenzied folly of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, and for the instruction of those who long with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ardour for a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the saving <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>. And, for the confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> doctrines, it has rightly added to these the letter of the President of the great and old Rome, the most blessed and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Archbishop Leo, which was addressed to Archbishop Flavian of blessed memory, for the removal of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> of Eutyches, judging them to be agreeable to the confession of the great Peter, and as it were a common pillar against misbelievers. For it opposes those who would rend the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the dispensation into a Duad of Sons; it repels from the sacred assembly those who dare to say that the Godhead of the Only Begotten is capable of suffering; it resists those who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a mixture or confusion of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of Christ; it drives away those who fancy his form of a servant is of an heavenly or some substance other than that which was taken of us, and it <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a> those who foolishly talk of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of our Lord before the union, conceiving that after the union there was only one.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers we teach with one voice that the Son [of God] and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is to be confessed as one and the same [Person], that he is perfect in Godhead and perfect in manhood, very God and very man, of a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and [<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>] body consisting, consubstantial with the Father as touching his Godhead, and consubstantial with us as touching his manhood; made in all things like us, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> only excepted; begotten of his Father before the worlds according to his Godhead; but in these last days for us men and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> born [into the world] of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> according to his manhood. This one and the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the only-begotten Son [of God] must be confessed to be in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>,  unconfusedly, immutably, indivisibly, inseparably [united], and that without the distinction of natures being taken away by such union, but rather the peculiar property of each nature being preserved and being united in one Person and subsistence, not separated or divided into two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but one and the same Son and only-begotten, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, as the Prophets of old time have spoken concerning him, and as the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> has taught us, and as the Creed of the Fathers has delivered to us.</p>

<p>These things, therefore, having been expressed by us with the greatest accuracy and attention, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Ecumenical Synod defines that no one shall be suffered to bring forward a different <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1F11;&#x03C4;&#x1F73;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03BD; &#x03C0;&#x1F77;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>), nor to write, nor to put together, nor to excogitate, nor to teach it to others. But such as dare either to put together another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or to bring forward or to teach or to deliver a different Creed (<span class="greek">&#x1F15;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x03C3;&#x1F7B;&#x03BC;&#x03B2;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) to as wish to be converted to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> whatever, if they be Bishops or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> let them be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, the Bishops from the Episcopate, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; but if they be <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laics</a>: let them be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>.</p>

<p>After the reading of the definition, all the most religious Bishops cried out: This is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the fathers: let the metropolitans immediately subscribe it: let them immediately, in the presence of the judges, subscribe it: let that which has been well defined have no delay: this is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostles: by this we all stand: thus we all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<p>And the whole <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod cried out: This is a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> sentence. This is a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> scheme. These things are fair to look upon.</p>

<p> <em>Decree with Regard to <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a></em></p>

<h2>Session XIII</h2>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges said [after the reading of the imperial letters was finished]: These divine letters say nothing whatever with regard to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, but both refer to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> belonging to metropolitan cities. But the sacred letters of Valentinian and Valens of divine memory, which then bestowed metropolitan rights upon the city of Nice, carefully provided that nothing should be taken away from other cities. And the canon of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers decreed that there should be one metropolis in each province. What therefore is the pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod in this matter?</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod cried out: Let the canons be kept. Let the canons be sufficient.</p>

<p>Atticus the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of old Nicopolis in Epirus said: The canon thus defines, that a metropolitan should have jurisdiction in each province, and he should constitute all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are in that province. And this is the meaning of the canon. Now the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, since from the beginning this was a metropolis, ought to ordain all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are in that province.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod said: This is what we all wish, this we all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for, let this everywhere be observed, this is pleasing to all of us.</p>

<p>John, Constantine, Patrick [Peter] and the rest of the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Pontic diocese [through John who was one of them] said: The canons recognize the one more ancient as the metropolitan. And it is manifest that the most religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> has the right of the ordination, and since the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> (as your magnificence has seen) have honoured Nice with the name only of metropolis, and so made its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> superior to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> only.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod said: They have taught in accordance with the canons, beautifully have they taught. We all say the same things.</p>

<p>[<em>A&euml;tius, Archdeacon of Constantinople, then put in a plea to save the rights of the throne of the royal city</em>.]</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges said: The most reverend the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> shall have the authority of metropolitan over the churches of the province of Bithynia, and Nice shall have the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> only of Metropolitical rank, submitting itself according to the example of the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>. For such is the pleasure of the Holy Synod.</p>

<h2>Session XV</h2>

<p> <em>The 30 Canons of the Holy and Fourth Synods, of Chalcedon.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 1</h3>

<p>We have judged it right that the canons of the Holy Fathers made in every synod even until now, should remain in force.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>Before the holding of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, in the Greek Church, the canons of several synods, which were held previously, were gathered into one collection and provided with continuous numbers, and such a collection of canons, as we have seen, lay before the Synod of Chalcedon. As, however, most of the synods whose canons were received into the collection, <em>e.g.</em> those of Neoc&aelig;sarea,  Ancyra, Gangra, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, were certainly not Ecumenical Councils, and were even to some extent of doubtful authority, such as the Antiochene Synod of 341, the confirmation of the Ecumenical Synod was now given to them, in order to raise them to the position of universally and unconditionally valid <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rules. It is admirably remarked by the <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian</a>, in his 131st Novel, cap. j.; <q>We <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the doctrinal decrees of the first four Councils as we do <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, but the canons given or <em>approved</em> by them as we do the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.</q></p>

<p>It seems quite impossible to determine just what councils are included in this list, the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Council in Trullo</a> has entirely removed this ambiguity in its second canon.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 2</h3>

<p>If any Bishop should ordain for money, and put to sale a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which cannot be sold, and for money ordain a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, or any other of those who are counted among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; or if through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of gain he should nominate for money a steward, or advocate, or prosmonarius, or any one whatever who is on the roll of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let him who is convicted of this forfeit his own rank; and let him who is ordained be nothing profited by the purchased ordination or promotion; but let him be removed from the dignity or charge he has obtained for money. And if any one should be found negotiating such shameful and unlawful transactions, let him also, if he is a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> from his rank, and if he is a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>According to <a href="../cathen/05541b.htm">Van Espen</a>, however, who here supports himself upon Du Cange, by <q>prosmonarios</q> or <q>mansionarius,</q> in the same way as by <q>oiconomos,</q> a steward of church property was to be understood.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 3</h3>

<p>It has come to [the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of] the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod that certain of those who are enrolled among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> have, through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of gain, become hirers of other men's possessions, and make contracts pertaining to secular affairs, lightly esteeming the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and slip into the houses of secular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, whose property they undertake through <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> to manage. Wherefore the great and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod decrees that henceforth no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> shall hire possessions, or engage in business, or occupy himself in worldly engagements, unless he shall be called by the law to the guardianship of minors, from which there is no escape; or unless the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city shall commit to him the care of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> business, or of unprovided <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> or <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who stand especially in need of the Church's help, through the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And if any one shall hereafter transgress these decrees, he shall be subjected to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties.</p>

<h3>Canon 4</h3>

<p>Let those who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and sincerely lead the monastic life be counted worthy of becoming <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; but, forasmuch as certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> using the pretext of monasticism bring confusion both upon the churches and into political affairs by going about promiscuously in the cities, and at the same time seeking to establish <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">Monasteries</a> for themselves; it is decreed that no one anywhere build or found a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> or oratory contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city; and that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in every city and district shall be subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and embrace a quiet course of life, and give themselves only to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, remaining permanently in the places in which they were set apart; and they shall meddle neither in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> nor in secular affairs, nor leave their own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> to take part in such; unless, indeed, they should at any time through urgent necessity be appointed thereto by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city. And no slave shall be received into any <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his master. And if any one shall transgress this our judgment, we have decreed that he shall be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, that the name of God be not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city must make the needful provision for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p><a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>: Like the previous canon, this one was brought forward by the Emperor Marcian in the sixth session, and then as number one, and the synod accepted the Emperor's proposed canon almost verbally. Occasion for this canon seems to have been given by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Eutychian tendencies, and especially by the Syrian Barsumas, as appears from the fourth session. He and his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had, as Eutychians, withdrawn themselves from the jurisdiction of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whom they suspected of Nestorianism.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 5</h3>

<p>Concerning <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or clergymen who go about from city to city, it is decreed that the canons enacted by the Holy Fathers shall still retain their force.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>It is supposed by <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were thinking of the case of Bassian, who, in the eleventh session (Oct. 29), pleaded that he had been violently ejected from the see of Ephesus. Stephen the actual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, answered that Bassian had not been <q>ordained</q> for that see, but had invaded it and been <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> expelled. Bassian rejoined that his original consecration for the see of Evasa had been forcible even to brutality; that he had never even visited Evasa, that therefore his appointment to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> was not a translation. Ultimately, the Council cut the knot by ordering that a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be elected, Basalan and Stephen retaining the episcopal title and receiving allowances from the revenues of the see (Mansi, vii. 273 <em>et seqq</em>.)</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 6</h3>

<p>Neither <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, nor any of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order shall be ordained at large, nor unless the person ordained is particularly appointed to a church in a city or village, or to a martyry, or to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. And if any have been ordained without a charge, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod decrees, to the reproach of the ordainer, that such an ordination shall be inoperative, and that such shall nowhere be suffered to officiate.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>.</span> </p>

<p>It is clear that our canon forbids the so-called absolute ordinations, and requires that every <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> must at the time of his ordination be designated to a definite church. The only <em>titulus</em> which is here recognized is that which was later <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as <em>titulus beneficii</em>. As various kinds of this title we find here (a) the appointment to a church in the city; (b) to a village church; (c) that to the chapel of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; (d) the appointment as chaplain of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. For the right understanding of the last point, it must be remembered that the earliest <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were in no wise <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, but that soon the custom was introduced in every larger convent, of having at least one <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> ordained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, that he might provide for divine service in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>.</p>

<p>By the word <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x1FF3;</span> (<q>martyry</q>) is meant a church or chapel raised over a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> grave. So the Laodicene Council forbids Churchmen to visit the <q>martyries of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a></q> (can. ix.). So Gregory of Nyssa speaks of <q>the martyry</q> of the Holy Martyrs (<em>Op</em>. ii., 212); Chrysostom of a <q>martyry,</q> and Palladius of <q>martyries</q> near <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (<em>In Act.

<h3>Canon 7</h3>

<p>We have decreed that those who have once been enrolled among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or have been made <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, shall accept neither a military charge nor any secular dignity; and if they shall presume to do so and not repent in such wise as to turn again to that which they had first chosen for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they shall be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 8</h3>

<p>Let the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the poor-houses, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and martyries remain under the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in every city according to the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers; and let no one arrogantly cast off the rule of his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and if any shall contravene this canon in any way whatever, and will not be subject to their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, if they be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, let them be subjected to canonical censure, and if they be <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, let them be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 9</h3>

<p>If any Clergyman have a matter against another <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, he shall not forsake his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and run to secular courts; but let him first lay open the matter before his own Bishop, or let the matter be submitted to any person whom each of the parties may, with the Bishop's consent, select. And if any one shall contravene these decrees, let him be subjected to canonical penalties. And if a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> have a complaint against his own or any other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, let it be decided by the synod of the province. And if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> should have a difference with the metropolitan of the province, let him have recourse to the Exarch of the Diocese, or to the throne of the Imperial City of Constantinople, and there let it be tried.</p>

<h3>Canon 10</h3>

<p>It shall not be lawful for a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> to be at the same time enrolled in the churches of two cities, that is, in the church in which he was at first ordained, and in another to which, because it is greater, he has removed from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of empty <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. And those who do so shall be returned to their own church in which they were originally ordained, and there only shall they minister. But if any one has heretofore been removed from one church to another, he shall not intermeddle with the affairs of his former church, nor with the martyries, almshouses, and hostels belonging to it. And if, after the decree of this great and ecumenical Synod, any shall dare to do any of these things now forbidden, the synod decrees that he shall be degraded from his rank.</p>

<h3>Canon 11</h3>

<p>We have decreed that the poor and those needing assistance shall travel, after examination, with letters merely pacifical from the church, and not with letters commendatory, inasmuch as letters commendatory ought to be given only to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are open to suspicion.</p>

<h3>Canon 12</h3>

<p>It has come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, having had recourse to secular powers, have by means of imperial rescripts divided one Province into two, so that there are consequently two metropolitans in one province; therefore the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod has decreed that for the future no such thing shall be attempted  by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, since he who shall undertake it shall be degraded from his rank. But the cities which have already been honoured by means of imperial letters with the name of metropolis, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in charge of them, shall take the bare title, all metropolitan rights being preserved to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Metropolis.</p>

<h3>Canon 13</h3>

<p>Strange and unknown clergymen without letters commendatory from their own Bishop, are absolutely prohibited from officiating in another city.</p>

<h3>Canon 14</h3>

<p>Since in certain provinces it is permitted to the readers and singers to marry, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod has decreed that it shall not be lawful for any of them to take a wife that is heterodox. But those who have already begotten children of such a marriage, if they have already had their children <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, must bring them into the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but if they have not had them <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, they may not hereafter <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, nor give them in marriage to a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, or a Jew, or a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, unless the person marrying the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> child shall promise to come over to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And if any one shall transgress this decree of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod, let him be subjected to canonical censure.</p>

<h3>Canon 15</h3>

<p>A <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></span> shall not receive the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> as a <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> under forty years of age, and then only after searching examination. And if, after she has had hands laid on her and has continued for a time to minister, she shall despise the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and give herself in marriage, she shall be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> and the man united to her.</p>

<h3>Canon 16</h3>

<p>It is not lawful for a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> who has dedicated herself to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, nor for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, to marry; and if they are found to have done this, let them be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. But we decree that in every place the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall have the power of indulgence towards them.</p>

<h3>Canon 17</h3>

<p>Outlying or rural parishes shall in every province remain subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who now have jurisdiction over them, particularly if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have peaceably and continuously governed them for the space of thirty years. But if within thirty years there has been, or is, any dispute concerning them, it is lawful for those who hold themselves aggrieved to bring their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> before the synod of the province. And if any one be wronged by his metropolitan, let the matter be decided by the exarch of the diocese or by the throne of Constantinople, as aforesaid. And if any city has been, or shall hereafter be newly erected by imperial authority, let the order of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> parishes follow the political and municipal example.</p>

<h3>Canon 18</h3>

<p>The crime of conspiracy or banding together is utterly prohibited even by the secular law, and much more ought it to be forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. Therefore, if any, whether clergymen or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, should be detected in conspiring or banding together, or hatching plots against their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or fellow <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, they shall by all means be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> from their own rank.</p>

<h3>Canon 19</h3>

<p>Whereas it has come to our ears that in the provinces the Canonical Synods of Bishops are not held, and that on this account many <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters which need reformation are neglected; therefore, according to the canons of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod decrees that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of every province shall twice in the year assemble together where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Metropolis shall approve, and shall then settle whatever matters may have arisen. And <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who do not attend, but remain in their own cities, though they are in good health and free from any unavoidable and necessary business, shall receive a brotherly admonition.</p>

<h3>Canon 20</h3>

<p>It shall not be lawful, as we have already decreed, for clergymen officiating in one church to be appointed to the church of another city, but they shall cleave to that in which they were first thought worthy to minister; those, however, being excepted, who have been driven by necessity from their own country, and have therefore removed to another church. And if, after this decree, any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall receive a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> belonging to another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, it is decreed that both the received and the receiver shall be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> until such time as the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> who has removed shall have returned to his own church.</p>

<h3>Canon 21</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Clergymen</span> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> bringing charges against <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or clergymen are not to be received loosely and without examination, as accusers, but their own character shall first be investigated.</p>

<h3>Canon 22</h3>

<p>It is not lawful for clergymen, after the death of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to seize what belongs to him, as has been forbidden also by the ancient canons; and those who do so shall be in danger of degradation from their own rank.</p>

<h3>Canon 23</h3>

<p>It has come to the hearing of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod that certain clergymen and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, having no authority from their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and sometimes, indeed, while under sentence of excommunication by him, betake themselves to the imperial Constantinople, and remain there for a long time, raising disturbances and troubling the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> state, and turning men's houses upside down. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod has determined that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be first notified by the Advocate of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church of Constantinople to depart from the imperial city; and if they shall shamelessly continue in the same practices, that they shall be expelled by the same Advocate even against their will, and return to their own places.</p>

<h3>Canon 24</h3>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">Monasteries</a></span>, which have once been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, shall remain <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for ever, and the property belonging to them shall be preserved, and they shall never again become secular dwellings. And they who shall permit this to be done shall be liable to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties.</p>

<h3>Canon 25</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Forasmuch</span> as certain of the metropolitans, as we have heard, neglect the flocks committed to them, and delay the ordinations of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod has decided that the ordinations of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> shall take place within three months, unless an inevitable necessity should some time require the term of delay to be prolonged. And if he shall not do this, he shall be liable to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties, and the income of the widowed church shall be kept safe by the steward of the same Church.</p>

<h3>Canon 26</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Forasmuch</span> as we have heard that in certain churches the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> managed the church-business without stewards, it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that every church having a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall have also a steward from among its own <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who shall manage the church business under the sanction of his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; that so the administration of the church may not be without a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; and that thus the goods of the church may not be squandered, nor reproach be brought upon the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; and if he [i.e., the Bishop] will not do this, he shall be subjected to the divine canons.</p>

<h3>Canon 27</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod has decreed that those who forcibly carry off <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> under pretence of marriage, and the aiders or abettors of such ravishers, shall be degraded if clergymen, and if <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 28</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Following</span> in all things the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, and acknowledging the canon, which has been just read, of the One Hundred and Fifty Bishops beloved-of-God (who assembled in the imperial city of Constantinople, which is New Rome, in the time of the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> memory), we also do enact and decree the same things concerning the privileges of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church of Constantinople, which is New Rome. For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of old Rome, because it was the royal city. And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops, actuated by the same consideration, gave equal privileges (<span class="greek">&#x1F34;&#x03C3;&#x03B1; &#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03B1;</span>) to the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> throne of New Rome, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> judging that the city which is honoured with the Sovereignty and the Senate, and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome, should in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters also be magnified as she is, and rank next after her; so that, in the Pontic, the Asian, and the Thracian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the metropolitans only and such <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> also of the Dioceses aforesaid as are among the barbarians, should be ordained by the aforesaid most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> throne of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church of Constantinople; every metropolitan of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his province, ordaining his own provincial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as has been declared by the divine canons; but that, as has been above said, the metropolitans of the aforesaid Dioceses should be ordained by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Constantinople, after the proper elections have been held according to custom and have been reported to him.</p>

<h3>Canon 29</h3>

<p>It is sacrilege to degrade a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>; but, if they are for just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> removed from episcopal functions, neither ought they to have the position of a Presbyter; and if they have been displaced without any charge, they shall be restored to their episcopal dignity.</p>

<p>And Anatolius, the most reverend Archbishop of Constantinople, said: If those who are alleged to have been removed from the episcopal dignity to the order of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, have indeed been condemned for any sufficient causes, clearly they are not worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. But if they have been forced down into the lower rank without just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, they are worthy, if they appear guiltless, to receive again both the dignity and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the Episcopate.</p>

<p>And all the most reverend Bishops cried out:</p>

<p>The judgment of the Fathers is right. We all say the same. The Fathers have righteously decided. Let the sentence of the Archbishops prevail.</p>

<p>And the most magnificent and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges said:</p>

<p>Let the pleasure of the Holy Synod be established for all time.</p>

<p> <em>From the Fourth Session of the same Holy Synod, having reference to the matter of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Bishops.</em></p>

<p>The most magnificent and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges, and the whole Senate, said:</p>

<h3>Canon 30</h3>

<p>Since the most religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> have postponed for the present their subscription to the letter of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Archbishop Leo, not because they oppose the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, but because they declare that it is the custom in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> diocese to do no such thing without the consent and order of their Archbishop, and ask to be excused until the ordination of the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the metropolis of Alexandria, it has seemed to us reasonable and kind that this concession should be made to them, they remaining in their official habit in the imperial city until the Archbishop of the Metropolis of Alexandria shall have been ordained.</p>

<p>And the most religious Bishop Paschasinus, representative of the Apostolic throne for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> ], said:</p>

<p>If your authority suggests and commands that any indulgence be shown to them, let them give securities that they will not depart from this city until the city of Alexandria receives a Bishop.</p>

<p>And the most magnificent and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges, and the whole Senate, said:</p>

<p>Let the sentence of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Paschasinus be confirmed.</p>

<p>And therefore let them [i.e., the most religious Bishops of the Egyptians] remain in their official habit, either giving securities, if they can, or being bound by the obligation of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>.</span> </p>

<p>This paragraph, like the previous one, is not a proper canon, but a verbal repetition of a proposal made in the fourth session by the imperial commissioners, improved by the legate Paschasinus, and approved by the Synod. Moreover, this so-called canon is not found in the ancient collections, and was probably added to the twenty-eight canons in the same manner and for the same reasons as the preceding.</p>

<p>Bright. </p>

<p>The council could insist with all plainness on the duty of hearing before condemning (see on Canon XXIX.); yet on this occasion <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> after <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gave vent to harsh unfeeling absolutism, the only excuse for which consists in the fact that the outrages of the Latrocinium were fresh in their minds, and that three of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> supplicants, whom they were so eager to terrify or crush, had actually supported Dioscorus on the tragical August 8, 449. It was not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to forget this; but the result is a blot on the history of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>.</p>

<p>Paschasinus and Lucentius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, holding the place of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, said: If your magnificence so orders, we have something to lay before you.</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges, said: Say what you wish. The most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Paschasinus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, holding the place of Rome, said: The rulers of the world, taking care of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by which their kingdom and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is increased, have deigned to define this, in order that unity through a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> peace may be preserved through all the churches. But with still greater care their clemency has vouchsafed to provide for the future, so that no contention may spring up again between God's <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, nor any schisms, nor any scandal. But yesterday after your excellencies and our humility had left, it is said that certain decrees were made, which we esteem to have been done contrary to the canons, and contrary to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline. We request that your magnificence order these things to be read, that all the brethren may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether the things done are just or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges said: If anything was done after our leaving let it be read.</p>

<p>And before the reading, A&euml;tius, the Archdeacon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople said: It is certain that the matters touching the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> received a suitable form. But it is customary at synods, after those things which are chiefest of all shall have been defined, that other things also which are necessary should be examined and put into shape. We have, I mean the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church of Constantinople has, manifestly things to be attended to. We asked the lord <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C2; &#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to join with us in these matters, but they declined, saying they had received no instructions on the subject. We referred the matter to your magnificence and you bid the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod to consider this very point. And when your magnificence had gone forth, as the affair was one of common interest, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, standing up, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that this thing might be done. And they were present here, and this was done in no hidden nor secret fashion, but in due course and in accordance with the canons.</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges said: Let the acts be read.</p>

<p>[<em>The canon (number</em> XXVIII <em>.), was then read, and the signatures, in all</em> 192 <em>, including the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Jerusalem, and Heraclea, but not Thalassius of C&aelig;sarea who afterwards assented. Only a week before</em> 350 <em>had signed the Definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. When the last name was read a debate arose as follows</em>. (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Col. 810.).]</p>

<p>Lucentius, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and legate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, said: In the first place let your excellency notice that it was brought to pass by circumventing the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> so that they were forced to sign the as yet unwritten canons, of which they made mention. [<em>The Greek reads a little differently</em> (<em>I have followed the Latin as it is supposed by the critics to be more pure than the Greek we now have</em>): Your excellency has perceived how many things were done in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in order that no one might be forced to sign the aforementioned canons; defining by necessity.]</p>

<p>The most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out: No one was forced.</p>

<p>Lucentius the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and legate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, said: It is manifest that the decrees of the 318 have been put aside, and that mention only has been made of those of the 150, which are not found to have any place in the synodical canons, and which were made as they acknowledge eighty years ago. If therefore they enjoyed this privilege during these years, what do they seek for now? If they never used it, why seek it? [<em>The Greek reads</em>: It is manifest that the present decrees have been added to the decrees of the 318 and to those of the 150 after them, decrees not received into the synodical canons, these things they pretend to be defined. If therefore in these times they used this benefit what now do they seek which according to the canons they had not used?]</p>

<p>A&euml;tius, the archdeacon of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church of Constantinople, said: If on this subject they had received any commands, let them be brought forward.</p>

<p>Bonifacius, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and vicar of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, said: The most blessed and Apostolic Pope, among other things, gave us this commandment. And he read from the chart, <q>The rulings of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers shall with no rashness be violated or diminished. Let the dignity of our person in all ways be guarded by you. And if any, influenced by the power of his own city, should undertake to make usurpations, withstand this with suitable firmness.</q></p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges said: Let each party quote the canons.</p>

<p>---------------------------------</p>

<p>Paschasinus, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and representative, read: Canon Six of the 318 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers, <q>The Roman Church has always had the primacy. Let <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> therefore so hold itself that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria have the authority over all, for this is also the custom as regards the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>. So too at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and in the other provinces let the churches of the larger cities have the primacy. [<em>In the Greek</em> 'let the primacy be kept to the churches.' <em>a sentence which I do not understand, unless it means that for the advantage of the churches the primatial rights of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> must be upheld. But such a sentiment one would expect to find rather in the Latin than in the Greek</em>.] And one thing is abundantly clear, that if any one shall have been ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the metropolitan, this great synod has decreed that such an one ought not to be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. If however the judgment of all his own [fellows] is reasonable and according to the canons, and if two or three dissent through their own obstinacy, then let the vote of the majority prevail. For a custom has prevailed, and it is an ancient tradition, that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem be honoured, let him have his consequent <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but the rights of his own metropolis must be preserved.</q></p>

<p>Constantine, the secretary, read from a book handed him by A&euml;tius, the archdeacon; Canon Six of the 318 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers. <q>Let the ancient customs prevail, those of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria shall have jurisdiction over all, since this also is the custom at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Likewise at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and in the rest of the provinces, let the rank (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03B1;</span>) be preserved to the churches. For this is absolutely clear that if anyone contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the metropolitan be ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, such an one the great synod decreed should not be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. If however by the common vote of all, founded upon reason, and according to the canons, two or three moved by their own obstinacy, make opposition, let the vote of the majority stand.</q></p>

<p>The same secretary read from the same codex the determination of the Second Synod. <q>These things the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> decreed who assembled by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Constantinople from far separated provinces,...and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not to go to churches which are outside the bounds of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, nor to confound the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, but according to the canons the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria shall take the charge of the affairs of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> only, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Orient shall govern the Oriental diocese only, the honours due to the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a> being guarded according to the Nicene canons, and the Asiatic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> shall care for the diocese of Asia only, and those of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> the affairs of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> only, and those of Thrace the affairs of Thrace only. But <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> shall not enter uncalled another diocese for ordination, or any other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> function. And the aforesaid canon concerning <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> being observed, it is evident that the synod of every province will administer the affairs of that particular province as was decreed at Nice. But the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> nations must be governed according to the custom which has prevailed from the times of the Fathers. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople however shall have the prerogative of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> next after the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, because Constantinople is new Rome.</q></p>

<p>---------------------------------</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges said: Let the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Asiatic and Pontic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have signed the tome just read say whether they gave their signatures of their own judgment or compelled by any necessity. And when these had come into the midst, the most reverend Diogenes, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Cyzicum, said: I call God to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that I signed of my own judgment. [<em>And so on, one after the other</em>.]</p>

<p>The rest cried out: We signed willingly.</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges said: As it is manifest that the subscription of each one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was given without any necessity but of his own will, let the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have not signed say something.</p>

<p>Eusebius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ancyra, said: I am about to speak but for myself alone.</p>

<p>[<em>His speech is a personal explanation of his own action with regard to consecrating a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for Gangra</em>.]</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges said: From what has been done and brought forward on each side, we perceive that the primacy of all (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F78; &#x03C0;&#x1F71;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03B1;</span>) and the chief <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x1F10;&#x03BE;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BC;&#x1F74;&#x03BD;</span>) according to the canons, is to be kept for the most God-beloved <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Old Rome, but that the most reverend <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the royal city Constantinople, which is new Rome, is to enjoy the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the same primacy, and to have the power to ordain the metropolitans in the Asiatic, Pontic, and Thracian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, in this manner: that there be elected by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and substantial (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span>) and most distinguished men of each metropolis and moreover by all the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province, or a majority of them, and that he be elected whom those afore mentioned shall deem worthy of the metropolitan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> and that he should be presented by all those who had elected him to the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of royal Constantinople, that he might be asked whether he [i.e., the Patriarch of Constantinople] willed that he should there be ordained, or by his commission in the province where he received the vote to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. The most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the ordinary towns should be ordained by all the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province or by a majority of them, the metropolitan having his power according to the established canon of the fathers, and making with regard to such ordinations no communications to the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of royal Constantinople. Thus the matter appears to us to stand. Let the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod vouchsafe to teach its view of the case.</p>

<p>The most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out: This is a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> sentence. So we all say. These things please us all. This is a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> determination. Establish the proposed form of decree. This is a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> vote. All has been decreed as should be. We beg you to let us go. By the safety of the Emperor let us go. We all will remain in this opinion, we all say the same things.</p>

<p>Lucentius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, said: The <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> gave orders that all things should be done in our presence [<em>This sentence reads in the Latin</em>: The <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> ought not to be humiliated in our presence. <em>I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> why Canon Bright in his notes on Canon XXVIII. has followed this reading</em>]; and therefore whatever yesterday was done to the prejudice of the canons during our absence, we beseech your highness to command to be rescinded. But if not, let our opposition be placed in the minutes, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> let us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> clearly [<em>Lat</em>. that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>] what we are to report to that most apostolic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who is the ruler of the whole church, so that he may be able to take action with regard to the indignity done to his See and to the setting at naught of the canons.</p>

<p>[John, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Sebaste, said: We all will remain of the opinion expressed by your magnificence. ]</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges said: The whole synod has approved what we proposed.</p>
