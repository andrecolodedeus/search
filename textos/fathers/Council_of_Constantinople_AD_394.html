<h1>Council of Constantinople (A.D. 394)</h1>

<p>In the consulate of our most religious and beloved-of-God Emperors, Flavius Arcadius Augustus, for the third time, and Honorius for the second time, on the third day before the calends of October, in the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> church of Constantinople, when the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had taken their seats [<em>here follow the names</em>], Nectarius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, said: Since by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God this synod has met in this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, if the synod of my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren and fellow ministers in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things thinks good, since I see our brothers Bagadius and Agapius, who contend between themselves about the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> of Bostra, are also present, let these begin to set forth their mutual rights. And after some things had been done by them for the sake of this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and it had been shown that the afore-named Bagadius was deposed by only two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, both of whom were dead, Arabianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ancyra, said: Not on account of this judgment, but fearing henceforth for my whole life, I desire the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod to make a decree, whether or no, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> by only two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and whether the Metropolitan is absent or not, without prejudice to the present <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that some, taking their power from these acts, may dare to attempt such things. I wish therefore your response.</p>

<p>Nectarius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, said: The most religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Arabianus has spoken most laudably. But since it is impossible to go backward in judgment, let us, without condemning that which is past, establish things for the future. Arabianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ancyra, said: The synod of blessed fathers who met at Nice condemns what has taken place, for it orders that not less than three shall ordain, nor even so without the metropolitan. But of the future I, full of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, have made this question. I would wish therefore that you would say clearly and without delay or <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could not, according to the decree of the Synod of Nice, lawfully be ordained or deposed by two men.</p>

<p>And, after some further debate, Theophilus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, said: Against those who have gone forth, no sentence of indignation can be pronounced, since those to be condemned were not present. But if any one were to consider those who are to be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> in future, it seems to me that not only these ought to assemble, but so far as possible all the other provincials, that by the sentence of many there may be rendered a more accurate condemnation of him who is present and is being judged, and who deserves deposition. Nectarius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, said: Since, the controversy is concerning legitimate institutions and decrees, it follows that nothing must be decreed on account of personal causes. Wherefore as the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Arabianus has said, wishing to make the future certain, the sentence of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Theophilus has consistently and considerately decreed that for the future it shall be lawful not even for three, far less for two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to depose him who is examined as a defendant: but by the sentence of the greater synod and of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province, according to the Apostolic Canons. Flavian, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, said: What things the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Nectarius, and the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Theophilus have set forth are clearly right. And all the ecclesiastics agreed with these.</p>
