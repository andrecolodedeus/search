<h1>Council of Ephesus (A.D. 431)</h1>

<h2>Session I</h2>

<h3>Extracts from the Acts</h3>

<p>[<em>Before the arrival of the Papal Legates</em>.]</p>

<p>The Nicene Synod set forth this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>:</p>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, etc.</p>

<p>When this creed had been recited, Peter the Presbyter of Alexandria, and primicerius of the notaries said:</p>

<p>We have in our hands the letter of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most reverend <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> Cyril, which he wrote to the most reverend <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, filled with counsel and advice, on account of his aberration from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>. I will read this if your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> [i.e., the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod] so orders....The letter began as follows:</p>

<p><span class="greek">&#x039A;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C6;&#x03BB;&#x03C5;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;&#x03C3;&#x03B9; &#x03BC;&#x1F72;&#x03BD;, &#x1F61;&#x03C2; &#x1F00;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x1F7B;&#x03C9;, &#x03BA;.&#x03C4;.&#x03BB;</span> .</p>

<h3>The Epistle of Cyril to Nestorius("Intelligo quosdam me&aelig;")</h3>

<p>To the most religious and beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fellow minister <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, Cyril sends greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>I hear that some are rashly talking of the estimation in which I hold your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and that this is frequently the case especially at the times that meetings are held of those in authority. And perchance they think in so doing to say something agreeable to you, but they speak senselessly, for they have suffered no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> at my hands, but have been exposed by me only to their profit; this man as an oppressor of the blind and needy, and that as one who wounded his mother with a sword. Another because he stole, in collusion with his waiting maid, another's money, and had always laboured under the imputation of such like crimes as no one would wish even one of his bitterest enemies to be laden with.  I take little reckoning of the words of such people, for the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> is not above his Master, nor would I stretch the measure of my narrow brain above the Fathers, for no matter what path of life one pursues it is hardly possible to escape the smirching of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, whose mouths are full of cursing and bitterness, and who at the last must give an account to the Judge of all.</p>

<p>But I return to the point which especially I had in mind. And now I urge you, as a brother in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, to propose the word of teaching and the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with all accuracy to the people, and to consider that the giving of scandal to one even of the least of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, exposes a body to the unbearable indignation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And of how great diligence and skill there is need when the multitude of those grieved is so great, so that we may administer the healing word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to them that seek it. But this we shall accomplish most excellently if we shall turn over the words of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, and are <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> their commands, proving ourselves, whether we be in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> according to that which is written, and conform our thoughts to their upright and irreprehensible teaching.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and great Synod therefore says, that the only begotten Son, born according to nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, very God of very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Light of Light, by whom the Father made all things, came down, and was incarnate, and was made man, suffered, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven. These words and these decrees we ought to follow, considering what is meant by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> being incarnate and made man. For we do not say that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Word was changed and became flesh, or that it was converted into a whole man consisting of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; but rather that the Word having personally united to himself flesh animated by a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, did in an ineffable and inconceivable manner become man, and was called the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, not merely as willing or being pleased to be so called, neither on account of taking to himself a person, but because the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> being brought together in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> union, there is of both one Christ and one Son; for the difference of the natures is not taken away by the union, but rather the divinity and the humanity make perfect for us the one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> by their ineffable and inexpressible union. So then he who had an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> before all ages and was born of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is said to have been born according to the flesh of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, not as though his divine nature received its beginning of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">holy Virgin</a>, for it needed not any second generation after that of the Father (for it would be absurd and foolish to say that he who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before all ages, coeternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, needed any second beginning of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>), but since, for us and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, he personally united to himself an <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, and came forth of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, he is in this way said to be born after the flesh; for he was not first born a common man of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin, and then the Word came down and entered into him, but the union being made in the womb itself, he is said to endure a birth after the flesh, ascribing to himself the birth of his own flesh. On this account we say that he suffered and rose again; not as if <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> suffered in his own nature stripes, or the piercing of the nails, or any other wounds, for the Divine nature is incapable of suffering, inasmuch as it is incorporeal, but since that which had become his own body suffered in this way, he is also said to suffer for us; for he who is in himself incapable of suffering was in a suffering body. In the same manner also we conceive respecting his dying; for the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is by nature <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and incorruptible, and life and life-giving; since, however, his own body did, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God taste death for every man, he himself is said to have suffered death for us, not as if he had any experience of death in his own nature (for it would be <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to say or think this), but because, as I have just said, his flesh tasted death. In like manner his flesh being raised again, it is spoken of as his resurrection, not as if he had fallen into corruption (God forbid), but because his own body was raised again. We, therefore, confess one Christ and Lord, not as worshipping. a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with the Word (lest this expression <q>with the Word</q> should suggest to the mind the idea of division), but worshipping him as one and the same, forasmuch as the body of the Word, with which he sits with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is not separated from the Word himself, not as if two sons were sitting with him, but one by the union with the flesh. If, however, we reject the personal union as impossible or unbecoming, we fall into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of speaking of two sons, for it will be necessary to distinguish, and to say, that he who was properly man was honoured with the appellation of Son, and that he who is properly the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, has by nature both the name and the reality of Sonship. We must not, therefore, divide the one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> into two Sons. Neither will it at all avail to a sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to hold, as some do, an union of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has not said that the Word united to himself the person of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but that he was made flesh. This expression, however, <q>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>,</q> can mean nothing else but that he partook of flesh and blood like to us; he made our body his own, and came forth man from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, not casting off his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or his generation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but even in taking to himself flesh remaining what he was. This the declaration of the correct <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> proclaims everywhere. This was the sentiment of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers; therefore they ventured to call the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, not as if the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Word or his divinity had its beginning from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin, but because of her was born that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body with a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to which the Word being personally united is said to be born according to the flesh. These things, therefore, I now write unto you for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, beseeching you as a brother, and testifying to you before Christ and the elect <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, that you would both think and teach these things with us, that the peace of the Churches may be preserved and the bond of concord and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> continue unbroken among the Priests of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h3>Extracts from the Acts (Continued)</h3>

<p>And after the letter was read, Cyril, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, said: This <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and great Synod has heard what I wrote to the most religious <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, defending the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>. I think that I have in no respect departed from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> statement of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that is from the creed set forth by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and great synod formerly assembled at Nice. Wherefore I desire your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> [i.e. the Council] to say whether rightly and blamelessly and in accordance with that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod I have written these things or no.</p>

<p>[<em>A number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> then gave their opinion, all favourable to Cyril; after these individual opinions the Acts continue</em> (col. 491):]</p>

<p>And all the rest of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the order of their rank deposed to the same things, and so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, according as the Fathers had set forth, and as the Epistle of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Archbishop Cyril to <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> declared.</p>

<p>Palladius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Amasea, said, The next thing to be done is to read the letter of the most reverend <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, of which the most religious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Peter made mention; so that we may understand whether or no it agrees with the exposition of the Nicene fathers.</p>

<p>And after this letter was read, Cyril, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, said, What seems good to this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and great synod with regard to the letter just read? Does it also seem to be consonant to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> set forth by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod assembled in the city of Nice?</p>

<p>[<em>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, then as before, individually express their opinion, and at last the Acts continue</em> (col. 502):]</p>

<p>All the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cried out together: Whoever does not <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. Such an one the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a>; such an one the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a>. Whoever communicates with <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>! We <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>: we all <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>: let all such as communicate with <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Juvenal, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem said: Let the letter of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and reverend C&aelig;lestine, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Rome, be read, which he wrote concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>[<em>The letter of C&aelig;lestine was read and no opinion expressed</em>.]</p>

<p>Peter the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Alexandria, and primicerius of the notaries said: Altogether in agreement with the things just read are those which his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> Cyril our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> wrote, which I now have at hand, and will read if your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> so shall order.</p>

<p>[<em>The letter was read which begins thus</em>:]</p>

<p><span class="greek">&#x03A4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03A3;&#x03C9;&#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; &#x1F21;&#x03BC;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD; &#x03BB;&#x1F73;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; &#x1F10;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x1FF6;&#x03C2;, &#x03BA;.&#x03C4;.&#x03BB;</span> .</p>

<h3>The Epistle of Cyril to Nestorius("Cum salvator noster")</h3>

<p>To the most reverend and God-loving fellow-minister <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, Cyril and the synod assembled in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Province, Greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>When our Saviour says clearly: <q>He that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me,</q> what is to become of us, from whom your Holiness requires that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you more than Christ the Saviour of us all? Who can help us in the day of judgment, or what kind of excuse shall we find for thus keeping silence so long, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> made by you against him? If you injured yourself alone, by teaching and holding such things, perhaps it would be less matter; but you have greatly scandalized the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and have cast among the people the leaven of a strange and new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. And not to those there [i.e. at Constantinople] only; but also to those everywhere [the books of your explanation were sent]. How can we any longer, under these circumstances, make a defence for our silence, or how shall we not be forced to remember that Christ said: <q>Think not that I have come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother.</q> For if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be injured, let there be lost the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, as stale and tottering, let even the law of tender <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards children and brothers be silenced, let death be better to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> than living; <q>that they might obtain a better resurrection,</q> as it is written.</p>

<p>Behold, therefore, how we, together with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod which met in great Rome, presided over by the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most reverend brother and fellow-minister, Celestine the Bishop, also testify by this third letter to you, and counsel you to abstain from these mischievous and distorted <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, which you hold and teach, and to receive the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, handed down to the churches from the beginning through the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles and Evangelists, who <q>were eye-witnesses, and ministers of the Word.</q> And if your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> have not a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to this according to the limits defined in the writings of our brother of blessed memory and most reverend fellow-minister Celestine, Bishop of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Rome, be well assured then that you have no lot with us, nor place or standing (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is not possible for us to overlook the churches thus troubled, and the people scandalized, and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> set aside, and the sheep scattered by you, who ought to save them, if indeed we are ourselves adherents of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, and followers of the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers. And we are in communion with all those <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and clergymen cast out or deposed by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for it is not right that those, who resolved to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> rightly, should suffer by your choice; for they do well in opposing you. This very thing you have mentioned in your epistle written to our most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Celestine of great Rome.</p>

<p>But it would not be sufficient for your reverence to confess with us only the symbol  of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> set out some time ago by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> at the great and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod convened in Nice: for you have not held and interpreted it rightly, but rather perversely; even though you confess with your voice the form of words. But in addition, in writing and by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, you must confess that you also <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those polluted and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of yours, and that you will hold and teach that which we all, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, teachers, and leaders of the people both East and West, hold. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod of Rome and we all agreed on the epistle written to your Holiness from the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> Church as being right and blameless. We have added to these our own letters and that which it is necessary for you to hold and teach, and what you should be careful to avoid. Now this is the Faith of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church to which all Orthodox Bishops, both East and West, agree:</p>

<blockquote><p><q>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible, and in one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, begotten of his Father, that is, of the substance of the Father; God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Light of Light, Very God of very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by whom all things were made, both those in heaven and those in the earth. Who for us men and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, came down, and was incarnate, and was made man. He suffered, and rose again the third day. He ascended into the heavens, from thence he shall come to judge both the quick and the dead. And in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: But those that say, There was a time when he was not, and, before he was begotten he was not, and that he was made of that which previously was not, or that he was of some other substance or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was capable of change or alteration; those the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Following in all points the confessions of the Holy Fathers which they made (the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> speaking in them), and following the scope of their opinions, and going, as it were, in the royal way, we confess that the Only begotten <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, begotten of the same substance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, True God from True <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Light from Light, through Whom all things were made, the things in heaven and the things in the earth, coming down for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, making himself of no <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x1F76;&#x03C2; &#x1F11;&#x03B1;&#x03C5;&#x03C4;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03C2; &#x03BA;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>), was incarnate and made man; that is, taking flesh of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin, and having made it his own from the womb, he subjected himself to birth for us, and came forth man from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, without casting off that which he was; but although he assumed flesh and blood, he remained what he was, God in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Neither do we say that his flesh was changed into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of divinity, nor that the ineffable nature of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was laid aside for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh; for he is unchanged and absolutely unchangeable, being the same always, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For although visible and a child in swaddling clothes, and even in the bosom of his Virgin Mother, he filled all creation as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was a fellow-ruler with him who begot him, for the Godhead is without quantity and dimension, and cannot have limits.</p>

<p>Confessing the Word to be made one with the flesh according to substance, we adore one Son and Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>: we do not divide the God from the man, nor separate him into parts, as though the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> were mutually united in him only through a sharing of dignity and authority (for that is a novelty and nothing else), neither do we give separately to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> the name Christ and the same name separately to a different one born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only one Christ, the Word from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father with his own Flesh. For as man he was anointed with us, although it is he himself who gives the Spirit to those who are worthy and not in measure, according to the saying of the blessed Evangelist John.</p>

<p>But we do not say that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> dwelt in him as in a common man born of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin, lest Christ be thought of as a God-bearing man; for although the Word tabernacled among us, it is also said that in Christ <q>dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily</q>; but we understand that he became flesh, not just as he is said to dwell in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but we define that that tabernacling in him was according to equality (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x1F34;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x1F10;&#x03BD; &#x03B1;&#x1F50;&#x03C4;&#x1FF7; &#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>). But being made one <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03C6;&#x1F7B;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>,  and not converted into flesh, he made his indwelling  in such a way, as we may say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man does in his own body.</p>

<p>One therefore is Christ both Son and Lord, not as if a man had attained only such a conjunction with God as consists in a unity  of dignity alone or of authority. For it is not equality of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which unites natures; for then Peter and John, who were of equal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> with each other, being both Apostles and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> [would have been one, and], yet the two are not one. Neither do we understand the manner of conjunction to be apposition, for this does not suffice for natural oneness (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F78;&#x03C2; &#x1F15;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x03C6;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F75;&#x03BD;</span>). Nor yet according to relative participation, as we are also joined to the Lord, as it is written <q>we are one Spirit in him.</q> Rather we deprecate the term of <q>junction</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03C6;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>) as not having sufficiently signified the oneness. But we do not call the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the God nor the Lord of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, lest we openly cut in two the one Christ, the Son and Lord, and fall under the charge of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, making him the God and Lord of himself. For the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, as we have said already, was made hypostatically one in flesh, yet he is God of all and he rules all; but he is not the slave of himself, nor his own Lord. For it is foolish, or rather impious, to think or teach thus. For he said that God was his Father, although he was God by nature, and of his substance. Yet we are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that while he remained <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he also became man and subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the law suitable to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the manhood. But how could he become the God or Lord of himself? Consequently as man, and with regard to the measure of his humiliation, it is said that he is equally with us subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; thus he became under the Law, although as God he spoke the Law and was the Law-giver.</p>

<p>We are careful also how we say about Christ: <q>I worship the One clothed on account of the One clothing him, and on account of the Unseen, I worship the Seen.</q> It is horrible to say in this connection as follows: <q>The assumed as well as the assuming have the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For the saying of this divides again Christ into two, and puts the man separately by himself and God also by himself. For this saying denies openly the Unity according to which one is not worshipped in the other, nor does God exist together with the other; but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is considered as One, the Only-begotten Son, to be honoured with one adoration together with his own flesh.</p>

<p>We confess that he is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and although according to his own nature he was not subject to suffering, yet he suffered for us in the flesh according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and although impassible, yet in his Crucified Body he made his own the sufferings of his own flesh; and by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God he tasted death for all: he gave his own Body thereto, although he was by nature himself the life and the resurrection, in order that, having trodden down death by his unspeakable power, first in his own flesh, he might become the first born from the dead, and the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of them that slept. And that he might make a way for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man to attain incorruption, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God (as we just now said), he tasted death for every man, and after three days rose again, having despoiled <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. So although it is said that the resurrection of the dead was through man, yet we understand that man to have been the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and the power of death was loosed through him, and he shall come in the fullness of time as the One Son and Lord, in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in order to judge the world in righteousness, as it is written.</p>

<p>For when as God he speaks about himself: <q>He who has seen me has seen the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> and <q>I and my Father are one,</q> we consider his ineffable divine nature according to which he is One with his Father through the identity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>&mdash; <q>The image and impress and brightness of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> But when not scorning the measure of his humanity, he said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: <q>But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> Again no less than before we recognize that he is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> from his identity and likeness to the Father and from the circumstances of his humanity. For if it is necessary to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that being by nature <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he became flesh, that is, a man endowed with a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, what reason can certain ones have to be ashamed of this language about him, which is suitable to him as man? For if he should reject the words suitable to him as man, who compelled him to become man like us? And as he humbled himself to a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> abasement (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>) for us, for what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can any one reject the words suitable to such abasement? Therefore all the words which are read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> are to be applied to One Person, to One hypostasis of the Word Incarnate. For the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> is One, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, although he is called <q>the Apostle and High Priest of our profession,</q> as offering to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Father the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which we make to him, and through him to God even the Father and also to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; yet we say he is, according to nature, the Only-begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And not to any man different from him do we assign the name of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and the thing, for he became <q>the Mediator between God and men,</q> and a Reconciler unto peace, having offered himself as a sweet smelling savour to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Father. Therefore also he said: <q>Sacrifice and offering you would not; but a body have you prepared me: In burnt offerings and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> you have had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do your will, O God.</q> For on account of us he offered his body as a sweet smelling savour, and not for himself; for what offering or <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was needed for himself, who as God <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> above all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? For <q>all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and come short of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> so that we became prone to fall, and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has fallen into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet not so he (and therefore we fall short of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>). How then can there be further <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lamb died for us and on our account? And to say that he offered himself for himself and us, could in no way escape the charge of impiety. For he never committed a fault at all, neither did he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. What offering then did he need, not having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for which <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are rightly offered? But when he spoke about the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he said: <q>He shall glorify me.</q> If we think rightly, we do not say that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">One Christ and Son</a> as needing <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from another received <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; for neither greater than he nor above him is his Spirit, but because he used the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to show forth his own divinity in his mighty works, therefore he is said to have been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by him just as if any one of us should say concerning his inherent strength for example, or his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of anything, <q>They <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> me.</q> For although the Spirit is the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, yet we think of him by himself, as he is the Spirit and not the Son; but he is not different from him; for he is called the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and Christ is the Truth, and he is sent by him, just as, moreover, he is from God and the Father. When then the Spirit worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> through the hands of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> into heaven, he <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> him. For it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that he who works through his own Spirit is God according to nature. Therefore he said: <q>He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.</q> But we do not say this as if the Spirit is wise and powerful through some sharing with another; for he is all perfect and in need of no good thing. Since, therefore, he is the Spirit of the Power and Wisdom of the Father (that is, of the Son), he is evidently Wisdom and Power.</p>

<p>And since the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin brought forth corporally God made one with flesh according to nature, for this reason we also call her <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, not as if the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Word had the beginning of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the flesh.</p>

<p>For <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and he is the Maker of the ages, coeternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and Creator of all; but, as we have already said, since he united to himself hypostatically <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from her womb, also he subjected himself to birth as man, not as needing necessarily in his own nature birth in time and in these last times of the world, but in order that he might bless the beginning of our <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and that that which sent the earthly bodies of our whole race to death, might lose its power for the future by his being born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the flesh. And this: <q>In sorrow you shall bring forth children,</q> being removed through him, he showed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of that spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>Strong death swallowed them up, and again God has wiped away every tear from off all faces.</q>  For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also we say that he attended, having been called, and also blessed, the marriage in <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, with his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles in accordance with the economy. We have been taught to hold these things by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles and Evangelists, and all the God-inspired Scriptures, and in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> confessions of the blessed Fathers.</p>

<p>To all these your reverence also should agree, and give heed, without any guile. And what it is necessary your reverence should <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> we have subjoined to our epistle. </p>

For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is that which we read, since the Truth cannot lie, to wit, the promise of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; <q>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</q> And since this is so, if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not absent from so small a number how much more may we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> he is present when so great a multitude of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones are assembled together! Every council is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> on account of a peculiar veneration which is its due; for in every such council the reverence which should be paid to that most famous council of the Apostles of which we read is to be had regard to. Never was the Master, whom they had received to preach, lacking to this, but ever was present as Lord and Master; and never were those who taught deserted by their teacher. For he that had sent them was their teacher; he who had commanded what was to be taught, was their teacher; he who affirms that he himself is heard in his Apostles, was their teacher. This duty of preaching has been entrusted to all the Lord's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in common, for by right of inheritance we are bound to undertake this solicitude, whoever of us preach the name of the Lord in various lands in their stead for he said to them, <q>Go, teach all nations.</q> You, dear brethren, should observe that we have received a general command: for he wills that all of us should perform that office, which he thus entrusted in common to all the Apostles. We must needs follow our predecessors. Let us all, then, undertake their labours, since we are the successors in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. And we show forth our diligence in preaching the same doctrines that they taught, beside which, according to the admonition of the Apostle, we are forbidden to add anything. For the office of keeping what is committed to our trust is no less dignified than that of handing it down.</p>

<p>They sowed the seed of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This shall be our care that the coming of our great father of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, to whom alone assuredly this fullness of the Apostles is assigned, may find fruit uncorrupt and many fold. For the vase of election tells us that it is not sufficient to plant and to water unless God gives the increase. We must strive therefore in common to keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which has come down to us today, through the Apostolic Succession. For we are expected to walk according to the Apostle. For now not our appearance (<em>species</em>) but our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is called in question. Spiritual weapons are those we must take, because the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is one of minds, and the weapons are words; so shall we be strong in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of our King. Now the Blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> admonishes that all should remain in that place in which he bid Timothy remain. The same place therefore, the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, lays upon us the same duty. Let us now also do and study that which he then commanded him to do. And let no one think otherwise, and let no one pay heed to over strange fables, as he himself ordered. Let us be unanimous, thinking the same thing, for this is expedient: let us do nothing out of contention, nothing out of vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: let us be in all things of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, of one heart, when the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is one, is attacked. Let the whole body grieve and mourn in common with us. He who is to judge the world is called into judgment; he who is to criticise all, is himself made the object of criticism, he who redeemed us is made to suffer <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>. Dear Brethren, gird yourselves with the armour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what helmet must protect our head, what breast-plate our breast. For this is not the first time the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> camps have received you as their rulers. Let no one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that by the favour of the Lord who makes two to be one, there will be peace, and that arms will be laid aside since the very <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> defends itself.</p>

<p>Let us look once again at these words of our Doctor, which he uses with express reference to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, saying, <q>Take heed to yourselves and to the whole flock, over which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has placed you as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that you rule the church of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he has purchased with his blood.</q></p>

<p>We read that they who heard this at Ephesus, the same place at which your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has come together, were called thence. To them therefore to whom this preaching of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, to them also let your defence of the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Let us show them the constancy of our mind with that reverence which is due to matters of great importance; which things peace has guarded for a long time with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> understanding.</p>

<p>Let there be announced by you what things have been preserved intact from the Apostles; for the words of tyrannical opposition are never admitted against the King of Kings, nor can the business of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be oppressed by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.</p>

<p>I exhort you, most blessed brethren, that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> alone be regarded in which we ought to remain, according to the voice of John the Apostle whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> we venerate in this city. Let common <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be offered to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. For we can form some idea of what will be the power of the divine presence at the united intercession of such a multitude of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, by considering how the very place was moved where, as we read, the Twelve made together their supplication. And what was the purport of that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the Apostles? It was that they might receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to speak the word of God with confidence, and to act through its power, both of which they received by the favour of Christ our God. And now what else is to be asked for by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council, except that you may speak the Word of the Lord with confidence? What else than that he would give you <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to preserve that which he has given you to preach? That being filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as it is written, you may set forth that one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which the Spirit himself has taught you, although with various voices.</p>

<p>Animated, in brief, by all these considerations (for, as the Apostle says: <q>I speak to them that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the law, and I speak wisdom among them that are perfect</q>), stand fast by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and defend the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, for so it is said, both to those past, present, and future, asking and preserving <q>those things which belong to the peace of Jerusalem.</q></p>

<p>Out of our solicitude, we have sent our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who are at one with us and are most approved men, Arcedius, and Projectus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, Philip, that they may be present at what is done and may carry out what things have been already decreed be us (<em>qu&aelig; a nobis antea statuta sunt, exequantur</em>).</p>

<p>To the performing of which we have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> will assent when it is seen that what has been decreed is for the security of the whole church. Given the viij of the Ides of May, in the consulate of Bassus and Antiochus.</p>

<h3>Extracts from the Acts</h3>

<p>And all the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the same time cried out. This is a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> judgment. To C&oelig;lestine, a new <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>! To Cyril a new <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>! To C&oelig;lestine the guardian of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>! To C&oelig;lestine of one mind with the synod! To C&oelig;lestine the whole Synod offers its thanks! One C&oelig;lestine! One Cyril! One <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Synod! One <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the world!</p>

<p>Projectus, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and legate, said: Let your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> consider the form (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) of the writings of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and venerable pope C&oelig;lestine, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who has exhorted your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> (not as if teaching the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, but as reminding them that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>) that those things which he had long ago defined, and now thought it right to remind you of, you might give command to be carried out to the uttermost, according to the canon of the common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and according to the use of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>Firmus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia said: The Apostolic and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> see of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> C&oelig;lestine, has previously given a decision and type (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) in this matter, through the writings which were sent to the most God beloved <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to wit to Cyril of Alexandria, and to Juvenal of Jerusalem, and to Rufus of Thessalonica, and to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches, both of Constantinople and of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. This we have also followed and (since the limit set for <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius's</a> emendation was long gone by, and much time has passed since our arrival at the city of Ephesus in accordance with the decree of the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor, and thereupon having delayed no little time so that the day fixed by the emperor was past; and since <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> although cited had not appeared) we carried into effect the type (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) having pronounced against him a canonical and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> judgment.</p>

<p>Arcadius the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and legate, said: Although our sailing was slow, and contrary winds hindered us especially, so that we did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether we should arrive at the destined place, as we had hoped, nevertheless by God's good providence...Wherefore we desire to ask your blessedness, that you command that we be taught what has been already decreed by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</p>

<p>Philip, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and legate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> said: We offer our thanks to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and venerable Synod, that when the writings of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed pope had been read to you, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> members by our [<em>or</em> your] <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> voices,  you joined yourselves to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> head also by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> acclamations. For your blessedness is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the head of the whole <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the head of the Apostles, is blessed Peter the Apostle. And since now our mediocrity, after having been tempest-tossed and much vexed, has arrived, we ask that you give order that there be laid before us what things were done in this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod before our arrival; in order that according to the opinion of our blessed pope and of this present <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> assembly, we likewise may ratify their determination.</p>

<p>Theodotus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ancyra said: The God of the whole world has made manifest the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the judgment pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod by the writings of the most religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> C&oelig;lestine, and by the coming of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. For you have made manifest the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> C&oelig;lestine, and his care for the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And since very reasonably your reverence is desirous of learning what has been done from the minutes of the acts concerning the deposition of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> your reverence will be fully convinced of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the sentence, and of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod, and the symphony of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> C&oelig;lestine has proclaimed with a great voice, of course after your full conviction, the rest shall be added to the present action.</p>

<h2>Session III</h2>

<h3>Extracts from the Acts</h3>

<p>Juvenal the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem said to Arcadius and Projectus the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and to Philip the most reverend <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>; Yesterday while this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and great synod was in session, when your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> was present, you demanded after the reading of the letter of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Great Rome, C&oelig;lestine, that the minutes made in the Acts with regard to the deposition of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> should be read. And thereupon the Synod ordered this to be done. Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> will be good enough to inform us whether you have read them and understand their power.</p>

<p>Philip the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and legate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> said: From reading the Acts we have found what things have been done in your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod with regard to <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>. We have found from the minutes that all things have been decided in accordance with the canons and with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline. And now also we seek from your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, although it may be useless, that what things have been read in your synod, the same should now again be read to us also; so that we may follow the formula (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C0;&#x1FF3;</span>) of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> pope C&oelig;lestine (who committed this same care to us), and of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> also, and may be able to confirm (<span class="greek">&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B2;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x1F7D;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) the judgment.</p>

<p>[<em>Arcadius having seconded Philip's motion, Memnon directed the acts to be read which was done by the primicerius of the notaries</em>.]</p>

<p>Philip the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and legate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> said: There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and in fact it has been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in all ages, that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most blessed Peter, prince (<span class="greek">&#x1F14;&#x03BE;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C7;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) and head of the Apostles, pillar of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and foundation (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, received the keys of the kingdom from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Saviour and Redeemer of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and that to him was given the power of loosing and binding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: who down even to today and forever both lives and judges in his successors. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most blessed pope C&oelig;lestine, according to due order, is his successor and holds his place, and us he sent to supply his place in this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod, which the most humane and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Emperors have commanded to assemble, bearing in mind and continually watching over the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For they both have kept and are now keeping intact the apostolic doctrine handed down to them from their most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and humane grandfathers and fathers of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory down to the present time, etc.</p>

<p>[<em>There is no further reference in the speech to the papal prerogatives</em>.]</p>

<p>Arcadius the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and legate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> said: <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> has brought us great sorrow....And since of his own accord he has made himself an alien and an exile from us, we following the sanctions handed down from the beginning by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles, and by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (for they taught what they had received from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>), also following the types (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) of C&oelig;lestine, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> pope of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, who has condescended to send us as his executors of this business, and also following the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod [we give this as our conclusion]: Let <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he is deprived of all episcopal dignity, and is an alien from the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and from the communion of all its <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</p>

<p>Projectus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and legate of the Roman Church said: Most clearly from the reading, etc....Moreover I also, by my authority as legate of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, define, being with my brethren an executor (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BA;&#x03B2;&#x03B9;&#x03B2;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03C2;</span>) of the aforesaid sentence, that the beforenamed <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> is an enemy of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a corrupter of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and as guilty of the things of which he was accused, has been removed from the grade of Episcopal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and moreover from the communion of all <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</p>

<p>Cyril, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria said: The professions which have been made by Arcadius and Projectus, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as also by Philip, the most religious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the Roman Church, stand manifest to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod. For they have made their profession in the place of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and of the whole of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod of the God-beloved and most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the West. Wherefore let those things which were defined by the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> C&oelig;lestine, the God-beloved <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, be carried into effect, and the vote cast against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod, which met in the metropolis of Ephesus be agreed to universally; for this purpose let there be added to the already prepared acts the proceedings of yesterday and today, and let them be shown to their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, so that by their subscription according to custom, their canonical agreement with all of us may be manifest.</p>

<p>Arcadius the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and legate of the Roman Church, said: According to the acts of this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod, we necessarily confirm with our subscriptions their doctrines.</p>

<p>The Holy Synod said: Since Arcadius and Projectus the most reverend and most religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and legates and Philip, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and legate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, have said that they are of the same mind with us, it only remains, that they redeem their promises and confirm the acts with their signatures, and then let the minutes of the acts be shown to them.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical Synod, gathered together in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> by the decree of our most religious Emperors, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and all the people in every province and city:</p>

<p>When we had assembled, according to the religious decree [of the Emperors], in the Metropolis of Ephesus, certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, a little more than thirty in number, withdrew from among us, having for the leader of their <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> John, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. Their names are as follows: first, the said John of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, John of Damascus, Alexander of Apamea, Alexander of Hierapolis, Himerius of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, Fritilas of Heraclea, Helladius of Tarsus, Maximin of Anazarbus, Theodore of Marcianopolis, Peter of Trajanopolis, Paul of Emissa, Polychronius of Heracleopolis, Euthyrius of Tyana, Meletius of Neoc&aelig;sarea, Theodoret of Cyrus, Apringius of Chalcedon, Macarius of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> Magna, Zosys of Esbus, Sallust of Corycus in Cilicia, Hesychius of Castabala in Cilicia, Valentine of Mutloblaca, Eustathius of Parnassus, Philip of Theodosia, and Daniel, and Dexianus, and Julian, and Cyril, and Olympius, and Diogenes, Polius, Theophanes of <a href="../cathen/11793a.htm">Philadelphia</a>, Trajan of Augusta, Aurelius of <a href="../cathen/08131b.htm">Irenopolis</a>, Mys&aelig;us of Aradus, Helladius of Ptolemais. These men, having no privilege of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> communion on the ground of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> authority, by which they could injure or benefit any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; since some of them had already been deposed; and since from their refusing to join in our decree against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, it was manifestly evident to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that they were all promoting the opinions of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and Celestius; the Holy Synod, by one common decree, deposed them from all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> communion, and deprived them of all their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power by which they might injure or profit any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 1</h3>

<p>Whereas it is needful that they who were detained from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod and remained in their own district or city, for any reason, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or personal, should not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the matters which were thereby decreed; we, therefore, notify your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and charity that if any Metropolitan of a Province, forsaking the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and Ecumenical Synod, has joined the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>, or shall join the same hereafter; or, if he has adopted, or shall hereafter adopt, the doctrines of Celestius, he has no power in any way to do anything in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province, since he is already cast forth from all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> communion and made incapable of exercising his ministry; but he shall himself be subject in all things to those very <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province and to the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> metropolitans, and shall be degraded from his episcopal rank.</p>

<h3>Canon 2</h3>

<p>If any provincial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were not present at the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod and have joined or attempted to join the apostacy; or if, after subscribing the deposition of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, they went back into the assembly of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>; these men, according to the decree of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod, are to be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and degraded from their rank.</p>

<h3>Canon 3</h3>

<p>If any of the city or country <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> have been inhibited by <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> or his followers from the exercise of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, on account of their <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, we have declared it just that these should be restored to their proper rank. And in general we forbid all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who adhere to the Orthodox and Ecumenical Synod in any way to submit to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have already <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> or shall hereafter <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 4</h3>

<p>If any of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should fall away, and publicly or privately presume to maintain the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> or Celestius, it is declared just by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod that these also should be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 5</h3>

<p>If any have been condemned for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> practices by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod, or by their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and if, with his usual lack of discrimination, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> (or his followers) has attempted, or shall hereafter attempt, uncanonically to restore such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to communion and to their former rank, we have declared that they shall not be profited thereby, but shall remain deposed nevertheless.</p>

<h3>Canon 6</h3>

<p>Likewise, if any should in any way attempt to set aside the orders in each case made by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod at Ephesus, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod decrees that, if they be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or clergymen, they shall absolutely forfeit their office; and, if <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, that they shall be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 7</h3>

<p>When these things had been read, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod decreed that it is unlawful for any man to bring forward, or to write, or to compose a different (<span class="greek">&#x1F11;&#x03C4;&#x1F73;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>) Faith as a rival to that established by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers assembled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in Nic&aelig;a.</p>

<p>But those who shall dare to compose a different <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or to introduce or offer it to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> desiring to turn to the acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whether from Heathenism or from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, or from any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> whatsoever, shall be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, if they be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or clergymen; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> and clergymen from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; and if they be <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, they shall be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>.</p>

<p>And in like manner, if any, whether <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, clergymen, or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, should be discovered to hold or teach the doctrines contained in the Exposition introduced by the Presbyter Charisius concerning the Incarnation of the Only-Begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, or the abominable and profane doctrines of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, which are subjoined, they shall be subjected to the sentence of this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical Synod. So that, if it be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he shall be removed from his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> and degraded; if it be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, he shall likewise be stricken from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; and if it be a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, he shall be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, as has been afore said.</p>

<h3>Canon 8</h3>

<p>Our brother <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Rheginus, the beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and his fellow beloved of God <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Zeno and Evagrius, of the Province of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, have reported to us an innovation which has been introduced contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> constitutions and the Canons of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Holy Apostles</a>, and which touches the liberties of all. Wherefore, since injuries affecting all require the more attention, as they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the greater damage, and particularly when they are transgressions of an ancient custom; and since those excellent men, who have petitioned the Synod, have told us in writing and by word of mouth that the Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> has in this way held ordinations in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>; therefore the Rulers of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> shall enjoy, without dispute or injury, according to the Canons of the blessed Fathers and ancient custom, the right of performing for themselves the ordination of their excellent Bishops. The same rule shall be observed in the other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and provinces everywhere, so that none of the God beloved Bishops shall assume control of any province which has not heretofore, from the very beginning, been under his own hand or that of his predecessors. But if any one has violently taken and subjected [a Province], he shall give it up; lest the Canons of the Fathers be transgressed; or the vanities of worldly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> be brought in under pretext of sacred office; or we lose, without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it, little by little, the liberty which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Deliverer of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, has given us by his own Blood.</p>

<p>Wherefore, this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical Synod has decreed that in every province the rights which heretofore, from the beginning, have belonged to it, shall be preserved to it, according to the old prevailing custom, unchanged and uninjured: every Metropolitan having permission to take, for his own security, a copy of these acts. And if any one shall bring forward a rule contrary to what is here determined, this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical Synod unanimously decrees that it shall be of no effect.</p>

<h3>The Letter of the Same Holy Synod of Ephesus, to the Sacred Synod in Pamphylia Concerning Eustathius Who Had Been Their Metropolitan</h3>

<p>Forasmuch as the divinely inspired <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>Do all things with advice,</q>  it is especially their duty who have had the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> ministry allotted to them to examine with all diligence whatever matters are to be transacted. For to those who will so spend their lives, it comes to pass both that they are established in [the enjoyment of] an honest hope concerning what belongs to them, and that they are borne along, as by a favouring breeze, in things that they desire: so that, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the saying [of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>] has much reason [to commend it]. But there are times when bitter and intolerable grief swoops down upon the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and has the effect of cruelly beclouding it, so as to carry it away from the pursuit of what is needful, and persuade it to consider that to be of service which is in its [very] nature mischievous. Something of this kind we have seen endured by that most excellent and most religious Bishop Eustathius. For it is in evidence that he has been ordained canonically; but having been much disturbed, as he declares, by certain parties, and having entered upon circumstances he had not foreseen, therefore, though fully able to repel the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> of his persecutors, he nevertheless, through an extraordinary inexperience of affairs, declined to battle with the difficulties which beset him, and in some way that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not set forth an act of resignation. Yet it behooved him, when he had been once entrusted with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> care, to cling to it with spiritual energy, and, as it were, to strip himself to strive against the troubles and gladly to endure the sweat for which he had bargained. But inasmuch as he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> himself to be deficient in practical capacity, having met with this misfortune rather from inexperience than from cowardice and sloth, your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has of necessity ordained our most excellent and most religious brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Theodore, as the overseer of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for it was not reasonable that it should remain in widowhood, and that the Saviour's sheep should pass their time without a shepherd. But when he came to us weeping, not contending with the aforenamed most religious Bishop Theodore for his See or Church, but in the meantime seeking only for his rank and title as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, we all suffered with the old man in his grief, and considering his weeping as our own, we hastened to discover whether the aforenamed [Eustathius] had been subjected to a legal deposition, or whether, forsooth, he had been convicted on any of the absurd charges alleged by certain parties who had poured forth idle gossip against his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. And indeed we learned that nothing of such a kind had taken place, but rather that his resignation had been counted against the said Eustathius instead of a [regular] indictment. Wherefore, we did by no means blame your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> for being compelled to ordain into his place the aforenamed most excellent Bishop Theodore. But forasmuch as it was not seemly to contend much against the unpractical character of the man, while it was rather necessary to have pity on the elder who, at so advanced an age, was now so far away from the city which had given him birth, and from the dwelling-places of his fathers, we have judicially pronounced and decreed without any opposition, that he shall have both the name, and the rank, and the communion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. On this condition, however, only, that he shall not ordain, and that he shall not take and minister to a Church of his own individual authority; but that [he shall do so only] if taken as an assistant, or when appointed, if it should so chance, by a brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in accordance with the ordinance and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If, however, you shall determine anything more favourable towards him, either now or hereafter, this also will be pleasing to the Holy Synod.</p>

<h3>The Letter of the Synod to Pope Celestine</h3>

<p>The Holy Synod which by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God was assembled at Ephesus the Metropolis to the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and our fellow-minister C&oelig;lestine, health in the Lord.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and your care for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, so grateful and highly pleasing to God the Saviour of us all, are worthy of all admiration. For it is your custom in such great matters to make trial of all things, and the confirmation of the Churches you have made your own care. But since it is right that all things which have taken place should be brought to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, we are writing of necessity [to inform you] that, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Christ the Saviour of us all, and in accordance with the orders of the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and Christ-loving Emperors, we assembled together in the Metropolis of the Ephesians from many and far scattered regions, being in all over two hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Then, in accordance with the decrees of the Christ-loving Emperors by whom we were assembled, we fixed the date of the meeting of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod as the Feast of the Holy Pentecost, all agreeing thereto, especially as it was contained in the letters of the Emperors that if anyone did not arrive at the appointed time, he was absent with no good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and was inexcusable both before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The most reverend John <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> stopped behind; not in singleness of heart, nor because the length of the journey made the impediment, but hiding in his mind his plan and his thought (which was so displeasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,) [a plan and thought] which he made clear when not long afterwards he arrived at Ephesus.</p>

<p>Therefore we put off the assembling [of the council] after the appointed day of the Holy Pentecost for sixteen whole days; in the meanwhile many of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were overtaken with illness, and much burdened by the expense, and some even died. A great injury was thus being done to the great Synod, as your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> easily perceives. For he used perversely such long delay that many from much greater distances arrived before him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless after sixteen days had passed, certain of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were with him, to wit, two Metropolitans, the one Alexander of Apamea, and the other Alexander of Hierapolis, arrived before him. And when we complained of the tardy coming of the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John, not once, but often, we were told, <q>He gave us command to announce to your reverence, that if anything should happen to delay him, not to put off the Synod, but to do what was right.</q> After having received this message&mdash;and as it was manifest, as well from his delay as from the announcements just made to us, that he refused to attend the Council, whether out of friendship to <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, or because he had been a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> of a church under his sway, or out of regard to petitions made by some in his favour&mdash;the Holy Council sat in the great church of Ephesus, which bears the name of Mary.</p>

<p>But when all with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> had come together, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> alone was found missing from the council, thereupon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod sent him admonition in accordance with the canons by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, a first, second, and third time. But he surrounding his house with soldiers, set himself up against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, neither did he show himself, nor give any satisfaction for his iniquitous <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>.</p>

<p>After this the letters were read which were written to him by the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a>, Cyril, which the Holy Synod approved as being <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and without fault (<span class="greek">&#x1F40;&#x03C1;&#x03B8;&#x1FF6;&#x03C2; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x1F00;&#x03BB;&#x1F75;&#x03C0;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03C2; &#x1F14;&#x03C7;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>), and in no point out of agreement either with the divinely inspired Scriptures, or with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> handed down and set forth in the great synod of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, which assembled sometime ago at Nice in Bithynia, as your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> also rightly having examined this has given <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand there was read the letter of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, which was written to the already mentioned most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and reverend brother of ours and fellow-minister, Cyril, and the Holy Synod was of opinion that those things which were taught in it were wholly alien from the Apostolic and Evangelical <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, sick with many and strange <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>.</p>

<p>His most impious expositions were likewise read, and also the letter written to him by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, in which he was properly condemned as one who had written <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and had inserted irreligious views (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;&#x1FB6;&#x03C2;</span>) in his private exegesis, and after this a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> sentence of deposition was pronounced against him; especially is this sentence just, because he is so far removed from being penitent, or from a confession of the matters in which he <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, while yet he had the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople, that even in the very metropolis of the Ephesians, he delivered a sermon to certain of the Metropolitical <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, men who were not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, but learned and God-fearing, in which he was bold enough to say, <q>I do not confess a two or three months old <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and he said other things more outrageous than this.</p>

<p>Therefore as an impious and most pestilent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which perverts our most pure religion (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03C1;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>) and which overthrows from the foundation the whole economy of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> [i.e. the Incarnation], we cast it down, as we have said above. But it was not possible, as it seemed, that those who had the sincere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and were <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in the Lord should not experience many trials. For we had hoped that the most reverend John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> would have praised the sedulous care and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the Synod, and that perchance he would have blamed the slowness of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius's</a> deposition. But all things turned out contrary to our hope. For he was found to be an enemy, and a most warlike one, to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod, and even to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, as these things indicate.</p>

<p>For as soon as he had come to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, before he had even shaken off the dust of the journey, or changed his travelling dress, he assembled those who had sided with <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and who had uttered <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> against their head, and only not derided the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and gathering as a college to himself, I suppose, thirty men, having the name of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (some of whom were without sees, wandering about and having no <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, others again had for many years been deposed for serious causes from their metropolises, and with these were <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> and the followers of Celestius, and some of those who were turned out of Thessaly), he had the presumption to commit a piece of iniquity no man had ever done before. For all by himself he drew up a paper which he called a deposition, and reviled and reproached the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and reverend Cyril, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, and the most reverend Memnon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ephesus, our brother, and fellow-minister, none of us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> anything about it, and not even those who were thus reviling <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was being done, nor for what reason they had presumed to do this. But ignoring the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God for such behaviour, and unheeding the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> canons, and forgetting that they were hastening to destruction by such a course of action, under the name of an excommunication, they then reviled the whole Synod. And placing these acts of theirs on the public bulletin boards, they exposed them to be read by such as chose to do so, having posted them on the outside of the theatres, that they might make a spectacle of their impiety. But not even was this the limit of their audacity; but as if they had done something in accordance with the canons, they dared to bring what they had done to the ears of the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and Christ-loving Emperors. Things being in this condition, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and reverend Cyril, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria and the most reverend Memnon <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Ephesus, offered some books composed by themselves and accusing the most reverend Bishop John and those who with him had done this thing, and conjuring our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod that John and those with him should be summoned according to the canons, so that they might apologize for their daring acts, and if they had any complaints to make they might speak and prove them, for in their written deposition, or rather sheet of abuse, they made this statement as a pretext, <q>They are <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and Eunomians, and therefore they have been deposed by us.</q> When, therefore, those who had endured their reviling were present, we again necessarily assembled in the great church, being more than two hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and by a first, second, and third call on two days, we summoned John and his companions to the Synod, in order that they might examine those who had been reviled, and might make explanations, and tell the causes which led them to draw up the sentence of deposition; but he  did not dare to come.</p>

<p>But it was right that he, if he could <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> prove the before-mentioned <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men to be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, both should come and prove the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of that which, accepted as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and indubitable crime, induced the temerarious sentence against them. But being condemned by his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> he did not come. Now what he had planned was this. For he thought that when that foundation-less and most <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> reviling was done away, the just vote of the Synod which it cast against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> would likewise be dissolved. Being <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> vexed, therefore, we determined to inflict according to law the same penalty upon him and those who were with him, which he contrary to law had pronounced against those who had been convicted of no fault. But although most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and in accordance with law he would have suffered this punishment yet in the hope that by our patience his temerity might be conquered, we have reserved this to the decision of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. In the meanwhile, we have deprived them of communion and have taken from them all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power, so that they may not be able to do any harm by their opinions. For those who thus ferociously, and cruelly, and uncanonically are wont to rush to such frightful and most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> things, how was it not necessary that they should be stripped of the powers which [as a matter of fact] they did not possess,  of being able to do harm.</p>

<p>With our brethren and fellow-ministers, both Cyril the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and Memnon, who had endured reproval at their hands, we are all in communion, and after the rashness [of their accusers] we both have and do perform the liturgy in common, all together celebrating the Synaxis, having made of none effect their play in writing, and having thus shown that it lacked all validity and effect. For it was mere reviling and nothing else. For what kind of a synod could thirty men hold, some of whom were marked with the stamp of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and some without sees and ejected [from their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>]? Or what strength could it have in opposition to a synod gathered from all the whole world? For there were sitting with us the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Arcadius and Projectus, and with them the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Philip, all of whom were sent by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, who gave to us your presence and filled the place of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03B4;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>). Let then your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> be angered at what took place. But if license were granted to such as wished to pour reproval upon the greater sees, and thus unlawfully and uncanonically to give sentence or rather to utter revilings against those over whom they have no power, against those who for religion have endured such great conflicts, by reason of which now also <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> shines forth through the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> [if, I say, all this should be tolerated], the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would fall into the greatest confusion. But when those who dare to do such things shall have been chastised aright, all disturbance will cease, and the reverence due to the canons will be observed by all.</p>

<p>When there had been read in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod what had been done touching the deposition of the most irreligious <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> and C&oelig;lestines, of C&oelig;lestius, and Pelagius, and Julian, and Pr&aelig;sidius, and Florus, and Marcellian, and Orontius, and those inclined to like <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, we also deemed it right (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x1F7D;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;</span>) that the determinations of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> concerning them should stand strong and firm. And we all were of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, holding them deposed. And that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in full all things that have been done, we have sent you a copy of the Acts, and of the subscriptions of the Synod. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you, dearly beloved and most longed for, may be strong and mindful of us in the Lord. </p>

<h3>Definition Against the Impious Messalians Who are Also Called Euchet&aelig; and Enthusiasts</h3>

<p>When the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Valerian and Amphilochius had come to us, they proposed that we should consider in common the case of the Messalians, that is the Euchetes or Enthusiasts, who were flourishing in Pamphylia, or by what other name this most contaminating <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is called. And when we were considering the question, the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Valerian, presented to us a synodical schedule which had been drawn up concerning them in the great city of Constantinople, under Sisinnius of blessed memory: What we read therein was approved by all, as well composed and as a due presentation of the case. And it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to us all, and to the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Valerian and Amphilochius and to all the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the provinces of Pamphylia and Lycaonia, that all things contained in that Synodical chart should be confirmed and in no way rescinded; also that the action taken at Alexandria might also be made firm, so that all those who throughout the whole province are of the Messalian or Enthusiastic <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, or suspected of being tainted with that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, may come together; and if they shall <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> in writing, according to the decrees pronounced in the aforesaid synod [their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>], if they are clergymen they may remain such; and if <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> they may be admitted to communion. But if they refuse to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a>, if they were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> or in any other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> grade, let them be cast out of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and from their grade, and also from communion; if they be lay-men let them be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore those convicted of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> are no more to be permitted to have the rule of our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, lest tares be sown and increase. And we give command that the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Valerian and Amphilochius, and the rest of the most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the whole province shall pay attention that this decree be carried into effect. In addition to this it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the filthy book of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which is called the <q>Asceticon,</q> should be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, as composed by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, a copy of which the most religious and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Valerian brought with him. Likewise anything savouring of their impiety which may be found among the people, let it be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover when they come together, let there be commended by them in writing such things as are useful and necessary for concord, and communion, and arrangement (<em>dispositionem vel dispensationem</em>). But should any question arise in connection with the present business, and if it should prove to be difficult and ambiguous, what is not approved by the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Valerian and Amphilochius, and the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> throughout the province, they ought to discuss all things by reference to what is written. And if the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Lycians or of the Lycaonians shall have been passed over; nevertheless let not a Metropolitan be left out of whatever province he may be. And let these things be inserted in the Acts so that if any have need of them they would find how also to expound these things more diligently to others.</p>

<h3>Decree of the Synod in the Matter of Euprepius and Cyril</h3>

<p>The petition of the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Euprepius and Cyril, which is set forth in the papers they offered, is honest. Therefore from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> canons and the external <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, which have from ancient custom the force of law,  let no innovation be made in the cities of Europa, but according to the ancient custom they shall be governed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by whom they have been formerly governed. For since there never was a metropolitan who had power otherwise, so neither hereafter shall there be any departure from the ancient custom.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>Two Thracian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Euprepius of Biza (Bizya) and Cyril of C&oelig;le, gave occasion for a decree, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for protection against their Metropolitan, Fritilas of Heraclea, who had gone over to the party of John of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and at the same time for the confirmation of the previous practice of holding two bishoprics at the same time. The Synod granted both.</p>
