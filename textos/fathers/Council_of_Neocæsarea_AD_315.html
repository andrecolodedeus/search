<h1>Council of Neoc&aelig;sarea (A.D. 315)</h1>

<div class="stiki">
<p>The Synod gathered together at <a href="../cathen/10741c.htm">Neoc&aelig;sarea</a>, which is a city of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, is next in order after that of Ancyra, and earlier in date than the rest, even than the First Ecumenical Synod at Nice. In this synod the Holy Fathers gathered together, among whom was the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Martyr Basil, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Amasea, adopted canons for the establishing of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order as follow&mdash; </p>

<p> The Canons of the Holy and Blessed Fathers Who Assembled at Neoc&aelig;sarea, Which are Indeed Later in Date Than Those Made at Ancyra, But More Ancient Than the Nicene: However, the Synod of Nice Has Been Placed Before Them on Account of Its Peculiar Dignity. </p>
</div>

<h2>Canons</h2>

<h3>Canon 1</h3>

<p>If a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> marry, let him be removed from his order; but if he commit fornication or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, let him be altogether cast out [i.e. of communion] and put to penance.</p>

<h3>Canon 2</h3>

<p>If a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall have married two brothers, let her be cast out [i.e. of communion] until her death. Nevertheless, at the hour of death she may, as an act of mercy, be received to penance, provided she declare that she will break the marriage, should she recover. But if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in such a marriage, or the man, die, penance for the survivor shall be very difficult.</p>

<h3>Canon 3</h3>

<p>Concerning those who fall into many marriages, the appointed time of penance is well known; but their manner of living and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shortens the time.</p>

<h3>Canon 4</h3>

<p>If any man lusting after a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> purposes to lie with her, and his design does not come to effect, it is evident that he has been saved by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 5</h3>

<p>If a catechumen coming into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have taken his place in the order of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, and fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, let him, if a kneeler, become a hearer and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more. But should he again <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> while a hearer, let him be cast out.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">John Zonaras</a>: "There are two sorts of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. For some have only just come in and these, as still imperfect, go out immediately after the reading of the scriptures and of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. But there are others who have been for some time in preparation and have attained some perfection; these wait after the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, and when they hear the words <q>Catechumens, bow down your heads to the Lord,</q> they kneel down. These, as being more perfect, having tasted the good words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if they fall, are removed from their position; and are placed with the <q>hearers</q>; but if any happen to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> while <q>hearers</q> they are cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> altogether."</span></p>

<h3>Canon 6</h3>

<p>Concerning a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with child, it is determined that she ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> whenever she will; for in this the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> communicates nothing to the child, since the bringing forward to profession is evidently the individual [privilege] of every single person.</p>

<h3>Canon 7</h3>

<p>A <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a></span> shall not be a guest at the nuptials of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> contracting a second marriage; for, since the digamist is worthy of penance, what kind of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> shall he be, who, by being present at the feast, sanctioned the marriage?</p>

<h3>Canon 8</h3>

<p>If the wife of a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and been clearly convicted, such [a husband] cannot enter the ministry; and if she commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> after his ordination, he must put her away; but if he retain her, he can have no part in the ministry committed to him.</p>

<h3>Canon 9</h3>

<p>A <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a></span> who has been promoted after having committed carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and who shall confess that he had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before his ordination, shall not make the oblation, though he may remain in his other functions on account of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in other respects; for the majority have affirmed that ordination blots out other kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But if he do not confess and cannot be openly convicted, the decision shall depend upon himself.</p>

<h3>Canon 10</h3>

<p>Likewise, if a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> have fallen into the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, let him have the rank of a minister.</p>

<h3>Canon 11</h3>

<p>Let not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> be ordained before he is thirty years of age, even though he be in all respects a worthy man, but let him be made to wait. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and began to teach in his thirtieth year.</p>

<h3>Canon 12</h3>

<p>If any one be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> when he is ill, forasmuch as his [profession of] <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, but of necessity [i.e. though <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death] he cannot be promoted to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbyterate</a>, unless on account of his subsequent [display of] <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and because of a lack of men.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">The word used in the Greek for <q>baptized</q> is <q>illuminated</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03C9;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x1FC7;</span>), a very common expression among the ancients.</span> </p>

<p> <span class="stiki"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a> explains that the reason for this prohibition was the well-known fact that in those ages <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was put off so as the longer to be free from the restraints which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was considered to impose.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 13</h3>

<p>Country <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> may not make the oblation in the church of the city when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of the city are present; nor may they give the Bread or the Cup with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. If, however, they be absent, and he [<em>i.e</em>., a country <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>] alone be called to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he may give them.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Many scholars, including Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore, read the last clause in the plural. In many manuscripts this canon is united with the following and the whole number given as 14.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 14</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a>, however, are indeed after the pattern of the Seventy; and as fellow-servants, on account of their devotion to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, they have the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of making the oblation.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">See the note under the previous canon, as in many manuscripts the two canons are united in the Ancient Epitome.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 15</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> ought to be seven in number, according to the canon, even if the city be great. Of this you will be persuaded from the Book of the Acts.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>This canon was observed in Rome and it was not until the xith century that the number of the Seven Cardinal Deacons was changed to fourteen. That Gratian received it into the <em>Decretum</em> (Pars. I., Dist. XCIII., c. xij.) is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> evidence that he considered it part of the Roman discipline. Eusebius  gives a letter of Pope Cornelius, written about the middle of the third century, which says that at that time there were at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> forty-four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and seven subdeacons; and that the number of those in inferior orders was very great. Thomassinus says that, <q>no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in this the Roman Church intended to imitate the Apostles who only ordained seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. But the other Churches did not keep themselves so scrupulously to that number.</q> </p>

<p>In the acts of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> it is noted that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> had fifteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and thirty-eight <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>.  And Justinian, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, appointed one hundred <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople. <a href="../cathen/05541b.htm">Van Espen</a> well points out that while this canon refers to a previous law on the subject, neither the Council itself, nor the Greek commentators Balsamon or <a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a> give the least hint as to what that Canon was.</p>

<p>The Fathers of Neoc&aelig;sarea base their limiting of the number of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to seven in one city upon the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, but the sixteenth canon of the Quinisext Council expressly says that in doing so they showed they referred to ministers of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, not to ministers at the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and that St. Stephen and the rest were not <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> at all in this latter sense. The reader is referred to this canon, where to defend the practice of Constantinople the meaning of the canon we are considering is entirely misrepresented.</p>
