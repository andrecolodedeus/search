<h1>De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men)</h1>


<p><span>You</span> have urged me, Dexter,  to follow the example of Tranquillus  in giving a systematic account of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, and to do for our writers what he did for the illustrious men of <a href="../cathen/09032a.htm">letters</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, namely, to briefly set before you all those who have published  any memorable writing on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, from the time of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">our Lord's passion</a> until the fourteenth year of the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>.  A similar work has been done by Hermippus  the peripatetic, Antigonus Carystius,  the learned Satyrus,  and most learned of all, Aristoxenus the Musician,  among the Greeks, and among the Latins by Varro,  Santra,  Nepos,  Hyginus,  and by him through whose example you seek to stimulate  us&mdash;Tranquillus.</p>

<p>But their situation and mine is not the same, for they, opening the old histories and chronicles could as if gathering from some great meadow, weave some  small crown at least for their work. As for me, what shall I do, who, having no predecessor, have, as the saying is, the worst possible master, namely myself, and yet I must acknowledge that <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius Pamphilus</a> in the ten books of his <a href="../fathers/2501.htm">Church History</a> has been of the utmost assistance, and the works of various among those of whom we are to write, often testify to the dates of their authors. And so I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>,  that what your Cicero, who stood at the summit of Roman eloquence, did not scorn to do, compiling in his <em>Brutus</em>, a catalogue of Latin orators, this I too may accomplish in the enumeration of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, and accomplish in a fashion worthy of the exhortation which you made. But if, perchance any of those who are yet writing have been overlooked by me in this volume, they ought to ascribe it to themselves, rather than to me, for among those whom I have not read, I could not, in the first place, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those who concealed their own writings, and, in the second place, what is perhaps well known to others, would be quite unknown to me in this out-of-the-way corner of the earth.  But surely when they are distinguished by their writings, they will not very greatly grieve over any loss in our non-mention of them. Let <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a>, <a href="../cathen/12282c.htm">Porphyry</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08557b.htm">Julian</a> learn, rabid as they are against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let their followers, they who think the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has had no philosophers or orators or men of learning, learn how many and what sort of men founded, built and adorned it, and cease to accuse our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of such rustic simplicity, and recognize rather their own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p><span><a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> </span> the son of John, from the village of <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida</a> in the province of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, brother of <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, and himself chief of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, after having been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">church of Antioch</a> and having preached to the <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">Dispersion</a> &mdash; the believers in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>,  in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia&mdash; pushed on to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the second year of Claudius to overthrow <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>,  and held the sacerdotal chair there for twenty-five years until the last, that is the fourteenth, year of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. At his hands he received the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> being nailed to the cross with his head towards the ground and his feet raised on high, asserting that he was unworthy to be crucified in the same manner as his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>. He wrote two <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistles</a> which are called <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic</a>, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him. Then too the <a href="../bible/mar000.htm">Gospel according to Mark</a>, who was his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> and interpreter, is ascribed to him. On the other hand, the books, of which one is entitled his Acts, another his Gospel, a third his Preaching, a fourth his Revelation, a fifth his <q>Judgment</q> are rejected as <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. </p>

<p>Buried at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a> near the triumphal way he is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by the whole world. </p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><span><a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a></span>,  who is called the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>,  surnamed the Just, the son of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> by another wife, as some think, but, as appears to me, the son of <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">Mary sister of the mother of our Lord</a> of whom <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> makes mention in his book,  after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">our Lord's passion</a> at once ordained by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, wrote a single <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a>, which is reckoned among the seven <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a> and even this is claimed by some to have been published by some one else under his name, and gradually, as time went on, to have gained authority. <a href="../cathen/07194a.htm">Hegesippus</a>, who lived near the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostolic</a> age, in the fifth book of his Commentaries, writing of <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>, says</p>

<blockquote><p><q>After the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a> surnamed the Just was made head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Many indeed are called James. This one was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> from his mother's womb. He drank neither <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">wine nor strong drink</a>, ate no flesh, never shaved or anointed himself with ointment or bathed. He alone had the privilege of entering the Holy of Holies, since indeed he did not use woolen vestments but linen and went alone into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in behalf of the people, insomuch that his knees were reputed to have acquired the hardness of camels' knees.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>He says also many other things, too numerous to mention. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> also in the 20th book of his Antiquities, and <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement</a> in the 7th of his Outlines mention that on the death of Festus who reigned over <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, Albinus was sent by <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> as his successor. Before he had reached his province, Ananias the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, the youthful son of Ananus of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> class, taking advantage of the state of anarchy, assembled a council and publicly tried to force <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> to deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>. When he refused Ananius ordered him to be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>. Cast down from a pinnacle of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, his legs broken, but still half alive, raising his hands to heaven he said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> forgive them for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.</q> Then struck on the head by the club of a fuller such a club as fullers are accustomed to wring out garments  with&mdash; he died. This same <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> records the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> that this <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> was of so great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> among the people that the downfall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was believed to be on account of his death. He it is of whom the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writes to the <a href="../cathen/06336a.htm">Galatians</a> that <q>No one else of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did I see except <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>,</q> and shortly after the event the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> bear witness to the matter. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> also which is called the Gospel according to the Hebrews,  and which I have recently translated into Greek and <a href="../cathen/09023a.htm">Latin</a> and which also <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>  often makes use of, after the account of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of the Saviour</a> says, <q>but the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, after he had given his grave clothes to the servant of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, appeared to <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> (for <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> had sworn that he <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">would not eat bread</a> from that hour in which he drank the cup of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> until he should see him <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rising again</a> from among those that sleep)</q> and again, a little later, it says <q>'Bring a table and bread,' said the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</q> And immediately it is added, <q>He brought bread and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> and broke and gave to <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the Just</a> and said to him, 'my brother eat your bread, for the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a> is <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen</a> from among those that sleep.'</q> And so he ruled the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> thirty years, that is until the seventh year of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> near the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> from which he had been cast down. His tombstone with its <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscription</a> was well known until the siege of <a href="../cathen/14746b.htm">Titus</a> and the end of <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Hadrian's</a> reign. Some of our writers think he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount Olivet</a>, but they are mistaken.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><span><a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">Matthew</a></span>,  also called Levi, <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> and aforetimes <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, composed a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at first published in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>  for the sake of those of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but this was afterwards translated into Greek, though by what author is uncertain. The <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> itself has been preserved until the present day in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">C&aelig;sarea</a> which <a href="../cathen/11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a> so diligently gathered. I have also had the opportunity of having the volume described to me by the Nazarenes  of <a href="../cathen/02513b.htm">Ber&oelig;a</a>,  a city of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, who use it. In this it is to be noted that wherever the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>, whether on his own account or in the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord the Saviour</a> quotes the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> he does not follow the authority of the translators of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> but the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>. Wherefore these two forms exist <q>Out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> have I called my son,</q> and <q>for he shall be called a <a href="../cathen/10724b.htm">Nazarene</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><span><a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a> </span> the brother of <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>, left a short <a href="../bible/jud001.htm">epistle</a> which is reckoned among the seven <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">catholic epistles</a>, and because in it  he quotes from the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> <a href="../cathen/01602a.htm">boo of Enoch</a> it is rejected by many. Nevertheless by age and use it has gained authority and is reckoned among the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><span><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a></span>,  formerly called Saul, an apostle outside the number of the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, was of the tribe of Benjamin and the town of Giscalis  in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. When this was taken by the Romans he removed with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to Tarsus in Cilicia. Sent by them to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to study law he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a>, a most learned man whom Luke mentions. But after he had been present at the death of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Stephen and had received letters from the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of the temple for the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he proceeded to Damascus, where constrained to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by a revelation, as it is written in the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, he was transformed from a persecutor into an elect vessel. As Sergius Paulus Proconsul of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> was the first to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in his preaching, he took his name from him because he had subdued him to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and having been joined by Barnabas, after traversing many cities, he returned to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and was ordained apostle to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by Peter, James and John. And because a full account of his life is given in the Acts of the Apostles, I only say this, that the twenty-fifth year after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">our Lord's passion</a>, that is the second of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, at the time when Festus Procurator of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> succeeded Felix, he was sent bound to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and remaining for two years in free custody, disputed daily with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> concerning the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. It ought to be said that at the first defence, the power of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> having not yet been confirmed, nor his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> broken forth to such a degree as the histories relate concerning him, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was dismissed by <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, that the gospel of Christ might be preached also in the West. As he himself writes in the second epistle to Timothy, at the time when he was about to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> dictating his epistle as he did while in chains; <q>At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account. But the Lord stood by  me and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and that all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might hear, and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion</q> &mdash; clearly indicating <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> as lion on account of his cruelty. And directly following he says <q>The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> delivered me from the mouth of the lion</q> and again shortly <q>The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> delivered me  from every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> work and saved me unto his heavenly kingdom,</q>  for indeed he felt within himself that his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> was near at hand, for in the same epistle he announced <q>for I am already being offered and the time of my departure is at hand.</q>  He then, in the fourteenth year of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> on the same day with Peter, was beheaded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake and was buried in the Ostian way, the twenty-seventh year after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">our Lord's passion</a>. He wrote nine epistles to seven churches: <em>To the Romans</em> one, <em>To the Corinthians</em> two, <em>To the Galatians</em> one, <em>To the Ephesians</em> one, <em>To the Philippians</em> one, <em>To the Colossians</em> one, <em>To the Thessalonians</em> two; and besides these to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <em>To Timothy</em> two, <em>To Titus</em> one, <em>To Philemon</em> one. The epistle which is called the <em>Epistle to the Hebrews</em> is not considered his, on account of its difference from the others in style and language, but it is reckoned, either according to <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> to be the work of Barnabas, or according to others, to be by Luke the Evangelist or Clement afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who, they say, arranged and adorned the ideas of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in his own language, though to be sure, since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was writing to Hebrews and was in disrepute among them he may have omitted his name from the salutation on this account. He being a Hebrew wrote Hebrew, that is his own tongue and most fluently while the things which were eloquently written in Hebrew were more eloquently turned into Greek  and this is the reason why it seems to differ from other epistles of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Some read one also to  the Laodiceans but it is rejected by everyone.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><span><a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> </span> the Cyprian, also called Joseph the Levite, ordained apostle to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, wrote one <em>Epistle</em>, valuable for the edification of the church, which is reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal writings</a>. He afterwards separated from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> on account of John, a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> also called Mark,  none the less exercised the work laid upon him of preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><span>Luke </span> a physician of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, as his writings indicate, was not unskilled in the Greek language. An adherent of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and companion of all his journeying, he wrote a <em><a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, concerning which the same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>We send with him a brother whose praise in the gospel is among all the churches</q>  and to the Colossians <q>Luke the beloved physician salutes you,</q>  and to Timothy <q>Luke only is with me.</q>  He also wrote another excellent volume to which he prefixed the title <em>Acts of the Apostles</em>, a history which extends to the second year of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> sojourn at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that is to the fourth  year of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, from which we learn that the book was composed in that same city. Therefore the <em>Acts of Paul and Thecla</em> and all the fable about the lion <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him we reckon among the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal writings</a>,  for how is it possible that the inseparable companion of the apostle in his other affairs, alone should have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this thing. Moreover <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> who lived near those times, mentions a certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> in Asia, an adherent of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,  who was convicted by John of having been the author of the book, and who, confessing that he did this for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, resigned his office of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. Some suppose that whenever <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in his epistle says <q>according to my gospel</q> he means the book of Luke and that Luke not only was taught the gospel history by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who was not with the Lord in the flesh, but also by other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. This he too at the beginning of his work declares, saying <q>Even as they delivered unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word.</q> So he wrote the gospel as he had heard it, but composed the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> as he himself had seen. He was buried at Constantinople to which city, in the twentieth year of Constantius, his bones together with the remains of <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> were transferred.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><span>Mark </span> the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> and interpreter of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> wrote a short gospel at the request of the brethren at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> embodying what he had heard <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> tell. When <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> had heard this, he approved it and published it to the churches to be read by his authority as Clemens in the sixth book of his Hypotyposes and <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Hierapolis, record. <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> also mentions this Mark in his first epistle, figuratively indicating Rome under the name of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> <q>She who  is in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> elect together with you salutes you  and so does Mark my son.</q> So, taking the gospel which he himself composed, he went to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and first preaching Christ at Alexandria he formed a church so admirable in doctrine and continence of living that he constrained all followers of Christ to his example. <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> most learned of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> seeing the first church at Alexandria still Jewish in a degree, wrote a book  on their manner of life as something creditable to his nation telling how, as Luke says, the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> had all things in common  at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, so he recorded that he saw  was done at Alexandria, under the learned Mark. He died in the eighth year of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> and was buried at Alexandria, Annianus succeeding him. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><span>John</span>,  the apostle whom Jesus most loved, the son of Zebedee and brother of James, the apostle whom <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">our Lord's passion</a>, beheaded, most recently of all the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> wrote a <em><a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Asia, against <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> and other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and especially against the then growing dogma of the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, who assert that Christ did not exist before Mary. On this account he was compelled to maintain His divine nativity. But there is said to be yet another reason for this work, in that when he had read Matthew, Mark, and Luke, he approved indeed the substance of the history and declared that the things they said were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but that they had given the history of only one year, the one, that is, which follows the imprisonment of John and in which he was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. So passing by this year the events of which had been set forth by these, he related the events of the earlier period before John was shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, so that it might be manifest to those who should diligently read the volumes of the four Evangelists. This also takes away the discrepancy which there seems to be between John and the others. He wrote also one <em>Epistle</em> which begins as follows <q>That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes and our hands handled concerning the word of life</q> which is esteemed of by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are interested in the church or in learning. The other two of which the first is <q>The elder to the elect lady and her children</q> and the other <q>The elder unto Gaius  the beloved whom I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> are said to be the work of John the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> to the memory of whom another sepulchre is shown at Ephesus to the present day, though some think that there are two memorials of this same John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>. We shall treat of this matter in its turn  when we come to <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a> his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. In the fourteenth year then after <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>  <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> having raised a second <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> he was banished to the island of <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a>, and wrote the <em>Apocalypse</em>, on which <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a> and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> afterwards wrote commentaries. But <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> having been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> and his acts, on account of his excessive cruelty, having been annulled by the senate, he returned to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> under Pertinax  and continuing there until the time of the <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Emperor Trajan</a>, founded and built churches throughout all Asia, and, worn out by old age, died in the sixty-eighth year after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">our Lord's passion</a> and was buried near the same city.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><span><a href="../cathen/07268b.htm">Hermas</a> </span>  whom the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> mentions in writing to the Romans <q>Salute  Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas  and the brethren that are with them</q>  is reputed to be the author of the book which is called <em>Pastor</em> and which is also read publicly in some churches of Greece. It is in fact a useful book and many of the ancient writers quote from it as authority, but among the Latins it is almost unknown.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo the Jew</a>,  an <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> class, is placed by us among the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers on the ground that, writing a book concerning the first church of Mark the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> at Alexandria, he writes to our praise, declaring not only that they were there, but also that they were in many provinces and calling their habitations <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. From this  it appears that the church of those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Christ at first, was such as now the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> desire to imitate,  that is, such that nothing is the peculiar property of any one of them, none of them rich, none poor, that patrimonies are divided among the needy, that they have leisure for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and psalms, for doctrine also and <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> practice, that they were in fact as Luke declares <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> were at first at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. They say that under Caius  Caligula he ventured to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whither he had been sent as legate of his nation, and that when a second time he had come to Claudius, he spoke in the same city with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and enjoyed his friendship, and for this reason also adorned the adherents of Mark, Peter's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> at Alexandria, with his praises. There are distinguished and innumerable works by this man: <em>On the five books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a></em>, one book <em>Concerning the confusion of tongues</em>, one book <em>On nature and invention</em>, one book <em>On the things which our senses desire and we detest</em>, one book <em>On learning</em>, one book <em>On the heir of divine things</em>, one book <em>On the division of equals and contraries</em>, one book <em>On the three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a></em>, one book <em>On why in Scripture the names of many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are changed</em>, two books <em>On covenants</em>, one book <em>On the life of a wise man</em>, one book <em>Concerning giants</em>, five books <em>That dreams are sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></em>, five books of <em>Questions and answers on Exodus</em>, four books <em>On the tabernacle and the Decalogue</em>, as well as books <em>On victims and promises or curses, On Providence, On the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, On the manner of one's life, On Alexander</em>, and <em>That dumb beasts have right reason</em>, and <em>That every fool should be a slave</em>, and <em>On the lives of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a></em>, of which we spoke above, that is, lives of apostolic men, which also he entitled, <em>On those who practice the divine life</em>, because in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they contemplate divine things and ever <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, also under other categories, two <em>On agriculture</em>, two <em>On <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>.</em> There are other monuments of his genius which have not come to our hands. Concerning him there is a proverb among the Greeks <q>Either <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> philonized, or <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> platonized,</q> that is, either <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> followed <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, so great is the similarity of ideas and language.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><span>Lucius Ann&aelig;us Seneca </span> of Cordova, <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Stoic Sotion  and uncle of Lucan the Poet, was a man of most continent life, whom I should not place in the category of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were it not that those <em>Epistles of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to Seneca and Seneca</em>  <em>to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a></em>, which are read by many, provoke me. In these, written when he was tutor of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> and the most powerful man of that time, he says that he would like to hold such a place among his countrymen as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> held among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> two years before Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> were crowned with <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p><span><a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a></span>,  the son of Matthias, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, taken prisoner by <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> and his son <a href="../cathen/14746b.htm">Titus</a>, was banished. Coming to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he presented to the emperors, father and son, seven books <em>On the captivity of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em>, which were deposited in the public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and, on account of his genius, was found worthy of a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He wrote also twenty books of <em>Antiquities</em>, from the beginning of the world until the fourteenth year of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> C&aelig;sar, and two of <em>Antiquities against Appion</em>, the grammarian of Alexandria who, under Caligula, sent as legate on the part of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> against <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, wrote also a book containing a vituperation of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation. Another book of his entitled, <em>On all ruling wisdom</em>, in which the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> deaths of the Maccabeans are related is highly esteemed. In the eighth book of his <em>Antiquities</em> he most openly acknowledges that Christ was slain by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> on account of the greatness of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, that John the Baptist was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was destroyed because of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of James the apostle. He wrote also concerning the Lord after this fashion: <q>In this same time was Jesus, a wise man, if indeed it be lawful to call him man. For he was a worker of wonderful <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and a teacher of those who freely receive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. He had very many adherents also, both of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be Christ, and when through the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of our chief men <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> had crucified him, nevertheless those who had loved him at first continued to the end, for he appeared to them the third day <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">alive</a>. Many things, both these and other wonderful things are in the songs of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who prophesied concerning him and the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, so named from Him, exists to the present day.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><span>Justus, </span>  of Tiberias of the province <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, also attempted to write a <em>History of Jewish affairs</em> and certain brief <em>Commentaries</em> on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> but <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> convicts him of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that he wrote at the same time as <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><span>Clement</span>,  of whom the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writing to the Philippians says <q>With Clement and others of my fellow-workers whose names are written in the book of life,</q>  the fourth <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a> after Peter, if indeed the second was Linus and the third Anacletus,  although most of the Latins think that Clement was second after the apostle.  He wrote, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a>, an especially valuable <em>Letter to the church of the Corinthians</em>, which in some places is publicly read, and which seems to me to agree in style with the epistle to the Hebrews which passes under the name of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> but it differs from this same epistle, not only in many of its ideas, but also in respect of the order of words, and its likeness in either respect is not very great. There is also a second <em>Epistle</em> under his name which is rejected by earlier writers, and a <em>Disputation between Peter and Appion</em> written out at length, which Eusebius in the third book of his Church history rejects. He died in the third year of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> and a church built at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> preserves the memory of his name unto this day.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>,  third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">church of Antioch</a> after Peter the apostle, condemned to the wild beasts during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, was sent bound to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and when he had come on his voyage as far as Smyrna, where <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> the pupil of John was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he wrote one epistle <em>To the Ephesians</em>, another <em>To the Magnesians</em>, a third <em>To the Trallians</em>, a fourth <em>To the Romans</em>, and going thence, he wrote <em>To the Philadelphians</em> and <em>To the Smyrneans</em> and especially <em>To Polycarp</em>, commending to him the church at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. In this last  he bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which I have recently translated, in respect of the person of Christ saying, <q>I indeed saw him in the flesh after the resurrection and I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he is,</q> and when he came to Peter and those who were with Peter, he said to them <q>Behold! Touch me and see me how that I am not an incorporeal spirit</q> and straightway they touched him and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Moreover it seems worth while inasmuch as we have made mention of such a man and of the <em>Epistle</em> which he wrote <em>to the Romans</em>, to give a few <q>quotations</q> : <q>From <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> even unto Rome I fight with wild beasts, by land and by sea, by night and by day, being bound amidst ten leopards, that is to say soldiers who guard me and who only become worse when they are well treated. Their wrong doing, however is my schoolmaster, but I am not thereby justified. May I have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the beasts that are prepared for me; and I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that I may find them ready; I will even coax them to devour me quickly that they may not treat me as they have some whom they have refused to touch through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. And if they are unwilling, I will compel them to devour me. Forgive me my children, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is expedient for me. Now do I begin to be a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and desire none of the things visible that I may attain unto <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Let fire and cross and attacks of wild beasts, let wrenching of bones, cutting apart of limbs, crushing of the whole body, tortures  of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>&mdash;let all these come upon me if only I may attain unto the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>When he had been condemned to the wild beasts and with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> heard the lions roaring, he said <q>I am the grain of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I am ground by the teeth of the wild beasts that I may be found the bread of the world.</q> He was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> the eleventh year of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> and the remains of his body lie in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> outside the Daphnitic gate in the cemetery.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a>,  the pupil of John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Hierapolis in Asia, wrote only five volumes, which he entitled <em>Exposition of the words of our Lord</em>, in which, when he had asserted in his preface that he did not follow various opinions but had the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> for authority, he said <q>I considered what <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> and <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said, what Philip, what <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a>, what James, what John,  what Matthew or any one else among the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of our Lord, what also Aristion and the elder John, <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord had said, not so much that I have their books to read, as that their living voice is heard until the present day in the authors themselves.</q> It appears through this catalogue of names that the John who is placed among the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> is not the same as the elder John whom he places after Aristion in his enumeration. This we say moreover because of the opinion mentioned above, where we record that it is declared by many that the last two epistles of John are the work not of the apostle but of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>.</p>

<p>He is said to have published a <em>Second coming of Our Lord or Millennium.</em> <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a> and others who say that after the resurrection the Lord will reign in the flesh with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, follow him. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> also in his work <em>On the hope of the faithful</em>, Victorinus of Petau and Lactantius follow this view.</p>

There is a letter of Alexander the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem who afterwards ruled the church with Narcissus, on the ordination of Asclepiades the confessor, addressed to the <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antiochians</a> congratulating them, at the end of which he says <q>these writings honoured  brethren I have sent to you by the blessed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Clement, a man illustrious and approved, whom you also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and with whom now you will become better acquainted a man who, when he had come hither by the special <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, strengthened and enlarged the church of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have been his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.

<h2>Chapter 39</h2>

<p><span>Miltiades </span> of whom Rhodo gives an account in the work which he wrote against <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, Prisca and Maximilla, wrote a considerable volume against these same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and other books <em>Against the nations and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em> and addressed an <em>Apology</em> to the then ruling emperors.

<h2>Chapter 40</h2>

<p><span>Apollonius</span>,  an exceedingly talented man, wrote against <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, Prisca and Maximilla a notable and lengthy volume, in which he asserts that <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> and his mad prophetesses died by hanging, and many other things, among which are the following concerning Prisca and Maximilla, <q>if they denied that they have accepted gifts, let them confess that those who do accept are not <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and I will prove by a thousand witnesses that they have received gifts, for it is by other fruits that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are shown to be <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> indeed. Tell me, does a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> dye his hair? Does a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> stain her eyelids with antimony? Is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> adorned with fine garments and precious stones? Does a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> play with dice and tables? Does he accept <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>? Let them respond whether this ought to be permitted or not, it will be my task to prove that they do these things.</q> He says in the same book, that the time when he wrote the work was the fortieth year after the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Cataphrygians. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> added to the six volumes which he wrote <em>On <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a></em> against the church a seventh, directed especially against Apollonius, in which he attempts to defend all which Apollonius refuted. Apollonius flourished in the reigns of Commodus and Severus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44</h2>

<p><span>Bacchylus</span>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Corinth, was held in renown under the same emperor Severus, and wrote, as representative of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were in Achaia, an elegant work <em>On the passover.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 45</h2>

<p><span>Polycrates </span> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Ephesians with other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Asia who in accordance with some ancient custom celebrated the passover with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> on the fourteenth of the month, wrote a synodical letter against Victor <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a> in which he says that he follows the authority of the apostle John and of the ancients. From this we make the following brief quotations, We therefore celebrate the day according to usage, inviolably, neither adding anything to nor taking anything from it, for in Asia lie the remains of the greatest <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of those who shall rise again on the day of the Lord, when he shall come in majesty from heaven and shall quicken all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, I mean Philip one of the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> who sleeps at Hierapolis and his two daughters who were <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> until their death and another daughter of his who died at Ephesus full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And John too, who lay on Our Lord's breast and was his <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> carrying the golden frontlet on his forehead, both <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and doctor, fell asleep at Ephesus and <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> died at Smyrna. Thraseas of Eumenia also, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, rests in the same Smyrna. What need is there of mentioning Sagaris, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, who sleeps in <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> and the blessed Papyrus and <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">Melito</a>, eunuch in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who, ever serving the Lord, was laid to rest in <a href="../cathen/13472a.htm">Sardis</a> and there awaits his resurrection at Christ's advent. These all observed the day of the passover on the fourteenth of the month, in nowise departing from the evangelical tradition and following the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> canon. I also, Polycrates, the least of all your servants, according to the doctrine of my <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> which I also have followed (for there were seven of my <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> indeed and I the eighth) have always celebrated the passover when the Jewish people celebrated the putting away of the leaven. And so brethren being sixty-five years old in the Lord and instructed by many brethren from all parts of the world, and having searched all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> those who threaten us, for my predecessors said <q>It is fitting to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> God rather than men.</q> I quote this to show through a small example the genius and authority of the man. He flourished in the reign of the emperor Severus in the same period as Narcissus of Jerusalem.</p>

<h2>Chapter 46</h2>

<p><span>Heraclitus </span> in the reign of Commodus and Severus wrote commentaries on the Acts and Epistles.</p>

<h2>Chapter 47</h2>

<p><span>Maximus</span>,  under the same emperors propounded in a remarkable volume the famous questions, <em>What is the origin of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></em>? And <em>Whether matter is made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 48</h2>

<p><span>Candidus </span> under the above mentioned emperors published most admirable treatises <em>On the six days of creation.</em></p>

<p><span>Appion </span> under the emperor Severus likewise wrote treatises <em>On the six days of creation.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 50</h2>

<p><span>Sextus </span> in the reign of the emperor Severus wrote a book <em>On the resurrection.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 51</h2>

<p><span>Arabianus </span> under the same emperor published certain small works relating to christian doctrine.</p>

<h2>Chapter 52</h2>

<p><span>Judas</span>,  discussed at length the seventy weeks mentioned in Daniel and wrote a <em>Chronography</em> of former times which he brought up to the tenth year of Severus. He is convicted of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in respect of this work in that he prophesied that the advent of Anti-Christ would be about his period, but this was because the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> seemed to forebode the end of the world.</p>

<h2>Chapter 53</h2>

<p><span><a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> </span> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, now regarded as chief of the Latin writers after Victor and Apollonius, was from the city of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> in the province of Africa, and was the son of a proconsul or Centurion, a man of keen and vigorous character, he flourished chiefly in the reign of the emperor Severus and Antoninus Caracalla and wrote many volumes which we pass by because they are well known to most. I myself have seen a certain <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> an old man of Concordia, a town of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, who, while he himself was a very young man had been secretary to the blessed Cyprian who was already advanced in age. He said that he himself had seen how Cyprian was accustomed never to pass a day without reading <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, and that he frequently said to him, <q>Give me the master,</q> meaning by this, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the church until middle life, afterwards driven by the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and abuse of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the Roman church, he lapsed to the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, and mentions the new <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in many of his books.</p>

<p>He composed, moreover, directly against the church, volumes: <em>On modesty, On <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, On <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, On monogamy</em>, six books <em>On <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a></em>, and a seventh which he wrote <em>Against Apollonius.</em> He is said to have lived to a decrepit old age, and to have composed many small works, which are not extant.</p>

<h2>Chapter 54</h2>

<p><span><a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a></span>,  surnamed Adamantius, a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> having been raised against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the tenth year of Severus Pertinax, and his father Leonidas having received the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, was left at the age of about seventeen, with his six brothers and widowed mother, in poverty, for their property had been confiscated because of confessing Christ. When only eighteen years old, he undertook the work of instructing the Catechetes in the scattered churches of Alexandria. Afterwards appointed by Demetrius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this city, successor to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Clement, he flourished many years. When he had already reached middle life, on account of the churches of Achaia, which were torn with many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, he was journeying to Athens, by way of Palestine, under the authority of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> letter, and having been ordained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> by Theoctistus and Alexander, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of C&aelig;sarea and Jerusalem, he offended Demetrius, who was so wildly enraged at him that he wrote everywhere to injure his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that before he went to C&aelig;sarea, he had been at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, under <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Bishop Zephyrinus</a>. Immediately on his return to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> he made Heraclas the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, who continued to wear his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher's</a> garb, his assistant in the school for catechetes. Heraclas became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">church of Alexandria</a>, after Demetrius. How great the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was, appears from the fact that Firmilianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea, with all the Cappadocian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, sought a visit from him, and entertained him for a long while. Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, he came to C&aelig;sarea  and was instructed at length by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>. It appears also from the fact that he went to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> religiously disposed, and was there held in great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant. Who is there, who does not also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he was so assiduous in the study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, that contrary to the spirit of his time, and of his people, he learned the Hebrew language, and taking the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> translation, he gathered the other translations also in a single work, namely, that of Aquila, of Ponticus the Proselyte, and Theodotian the Ebonite, and Symmachus an adherent of the same <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> who wrote commentaries also on the gospel according to Matthew, from which he tried to establish his doctrine. And besides these, a fifth, sixth, and seventh translation, which we also have from his <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, he sought out with great diligence, and compared with other editions. And since I have given a list of his works, in the volumes of letters which I have written to <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, in a letter which I wrote against the works of Varro, I pass this by now, not failing however, to make mention of his <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> genius, how that he understood dialectics, as well as geometry, arithmetic, music, grammar, and rhetoric, and taught all the schools of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, in such wise that he had also diligent students in secular literature, and lectured to them daily, and the crowds which flocked to him were marvellous. These, he received in the hope that through the instrumentality of this secular literature, he might establish them in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to speak of the cruelty of that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which was raised against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>, who was mad against the religion of Philip, whom he had slain,&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in which Fabianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Roman church, perished at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Alexander and Babylas, Pontifs of the churches of Jerusalem and <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, were imprisoned for their confession of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If any one wishes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what was done in regard to the position of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, he can clearly learn, first indeed from his own epistles, which after the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, were sent to different ones, and secondly, from the sixth book of the church history of Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea, and from his six volumes in behalf of the same <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>.</p>

<p>He lived until the time of Gallus and Volusianus, that is, until his sixty-ninth year, and died at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, in which city he also was buried.</p>

<h2>Chapter 55</h2>

<p><span>Ammonius</span>,  a talented man of great <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> learning, was distinguished at Alexandria, at the same time. Among many and distinguished monuments of his genius, is the elaborate work which he composed <em>On the harmony of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Jesus</em>, and the <em><a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> canons</em>, which he worked out, and which Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea, afterwards followed. Porphyry <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accused him of having become a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> again, after being a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but it is certain that he continued a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> until the very end of his life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 56</h2>

<p><span>Ambrosius</span>,  at first a Marcionite but afterwards set right by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in the church, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> distinguished as confessor of the Lord. To him, together with Protoctetus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, the book of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <em>On <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a></em> was written. Aided  by his industry, funds, and perseverance, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> dictated a great number of volumes. He himself, as befits a man of noble nature, was of no mean literary talent, as his letters to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> indicate. He died moreover, before the death of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and is condemned by many, in that being a man of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, he did not at death, remember in his will, his old and needy friend.</p>

<h2>Chapter 57</h2>

<p><span>Trypho</span>,  pupil of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, to whom some of his extant letters are addressed, was very learned in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and this many of his works show here and there, but especially the book which he composed <em>On the red heifer</em> in Deuteronomy, and <em>On the halves</em>, which with the pigeon and the turtledoves were offered by <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> as recorded in Genesis. </p>

<h2>Chapter 58</h2>

<p><span>Minucius </span> Felix, a distinguished advocate of Rome, wrote a dialogue representing a discussion between a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and a Gentile, which is entitled <em>Octavius</em>, and still another work passes current in his name, <em>On <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a></em>, or <em>Against the mathematicians</em>, but this although it is the work of a talented man, does not seem to me to correspond in style with the above mentioned work. Lactantius also mentions this Minucius in his works.</p>

<h2>Chapter 59</h2>

<p><span>Gaius</span>,  <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, in the time of <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a>, that is, in the reign of Antoninus, the son of Severus, delivered a very notable disputation <em>Against Proculus</em>, the follower of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, convicting him of temerity in his defence of the new <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and in the same volume also enumerating only thirteen epistles of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, says that the fourteenth, which is now called, <em>To the Hebrews</em>, is not by him, and is not considered among the Romans to the present day as being by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</p>

Set right by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, he wrote various short works, especially letters, in which he thanks <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. The letters of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> to him, are also extant, and a dialogue between <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and Beryllus as well, in which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> are discussed.

<h2>Chapter 62</h2>

<p><span>Alexander</span>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Cappadocia, desiring to visit the Holy Land, came to Jerusalem, at the time when Narcissus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this city, already an old man, ruled the church. It was revealed to Narcissus and many of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, that on the morning of the next day, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> would enter the city, who should be assistant on the sacerdotal throne. And so it came to pass, as it was predicted, and all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Palestine being gathered together, Narcissus himself being especially urgent, Alexander took with him the helm of the church of Jerusalem. At the end of one of his epistles, written to the Antinoites <em>On the peace of the church</em>, he says <q>Narcissus, who held the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> here before me, and now with me exercises his office by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, being about a hundred and sixteen years old, salutes you, and with me begs you to become of one mind.</q> He wrote another also <em>To the Antiocheans</em>, by the hand of Clement, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Alexandria, of whom we spoke above, another also <em>To <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a></em>, and <em>In behalf of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> against Demetrius</em>, called forth by the fact that, according to the testimony of Demetrius, he had made <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. There are other epistles of his to different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. In the seventh <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>, at the time when Babylas of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, brought to C&aelig;sarea and shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, he received the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for confessing Christ.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a>,  whose five volumes <em>On Chronology</em>, are yet extant, in the reign of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</a>, who succeeded Macrinus, received a commission to restore the city of Emmaus, which afterwards was called Nicopolis. There is an epistle of his to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <em>On the question of Susanna</em>, where it is contended that this story is not contained in the Hebrew, and is not consistent with the Hebrew etymology in respect of the play on <q>prinos and prisai,</q> <q>schinos and schisai.</q> In reply to this, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> wrote a learned epistle. There is extant another letter of his, <em>To Aristides</em>, in which he discusses at length the discrepancies, which appear in the genealogy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, as recorded by Matthew and Luke.</p>

<p><span>Geminus</span>,  <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the church at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, composed a few monuments of his genius, flourishing in the time of the Emperor Alexander and Zebennus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his city, especially at the time at which Heraclas was ordained Pontiff of the church at Alexandria.</p>

<h2>Chapter 65</h2>

<p><span>Theodorus</span>,  afterwards called Gregory, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Neoc&aelig;sarea in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, while yet a very young man, in company with his brother Athenodorus, went from Cappadocia to Berytus, and thence to <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">C&aelig;sarea in Palestine</a>, to study Greek and Latin literature. When <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> had seen the remarkable natural ability of these men, he urged them to study <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, in the teaching of which he gradually introduced the matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and made them also his followers. So, instructed by him for five years, they were sent back by him to their mother. Theodorus, on his departure, wrote a panegyric of thanks to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and delivered it before a large assembly, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> himself being present. This panegyric is extant at the present day.</p>

<p>He wrote also a short, but very valuable, paraphrase <em>On Ecclesiastes</em>, and current report speaks of other epistles of his, but more especially of the signs and wonders, which as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he performed to the great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the churches.</p>

<h2>Chapter 66</h2>

<p><span>Cornelius</span>,  <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, to whom eight letters of Cyprian are extant, wrote a letter to Fabius,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <em>On the Roman, Italian, and African councils</em>, and another <em>On <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> and those who had fallen from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>, a third <em>On the acts of the council</em>, and a fourth very prolix one to the same Fabius, containing the causes of the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> of it. He ruled the church for two years under Gallus and Volusianus. He received the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and was succeeded by Lucius.</p>

<h2>Chapter 67</h2>

<p><span>Cyprian </span> of Africa, at first was famous as a teacher of rhetoric, and afterwards on the persuasion of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Caecilius, from whom he received his surname, he became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and gave all his substance to the poor. Not long after he was inducted into the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>, and was also made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. It is unnecessary to make a catalogue of the works of his genius, since they are more conspicuous than the sun.</p>

<p>He was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> under the Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, in the eighth <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, on the same day that Cornelius was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but not in the same year.</p>

<h2>Chapter 68</h2>

<p><span>Pontius</span>,  <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Cyprian, sharing his exile until the day of his death, left a notable volume <em>On the life and death of Cyprian.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 69</h2>

<p><span>Dionysius</span>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> had charge of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> school under Heraclas, and was the most distinguished pupil of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. Consenting to the doctrine of Cyprian and the African synod, on the rebaptizing  of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, he sent many letters to different people, which are yet extant; He wrote one to Fabius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <em>On penitence</em>, another <em>To the Romans</em>, by the hand of Hippolytus, two letters <em>To Xystus</em>, who had succeeded Stephen, two also <em>To Philemon and Dionysius</em>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of the church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and another <em>To</em> the same <em>Dionysius</em>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>; and <em>To <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a></em>, treating of their claim that <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> had been ordained <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, against his will. The beginning of this epistle is as follows: <q>Dionysius to <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, his brother greeting. If you have been ordained unwillingly, as you say, you will prove it, when you shall willingly retire.</q></p>

<p>There is another epistle of his also <em>To Dionysius and Didymus</em>, and many <em>Festal epistles on the passover</em>, written in a declamatory style, also one to the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">church of Alexandria</a> <em>On exile</em>, one <em>To Hierax</em>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and yet others <em>On mortality, On the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a></em>, and <em>On the gymnasium</em>, also one <em>To Hermammon</em> and others <em>On the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a></em>, and two books <em>Against Nepos the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a></em>, who asserted in his writings a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years reign</a> in the body. Among other things he diligently discussed the <em>Apocalypse of John</em>, and wrote <em>Against Sabellius</em> and <em>To Ammon</em>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Bernice,  and <em>To Telesphorus</em>, also <em>To Euphranor</em>, also four books <em>To Dionysius</em>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, to the Laodiceans <em>On penitence</em>, to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> <em>On <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a></em>, to the Armenians <em>On penitence</em>, also <em>On the order of transgression</em>, to Timothy <em>On nature</em>, to Euphranor <em>On <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a></em>, many letters also <em>To Basilides</em>, in one of which he asserts that he also began to write commentaries on Ecclesiastes. The notable epistle which he wrote against <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>, a few days before his death is also current. He died in the twelfth year of Gallienus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 70</h2>

<p><span>Novatianus</span>,  <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Rome, attempted to usurp the sacerdotal chair occupied by Cornelius, and established the dogma of the Novatians, or as they are called in Greek, the Cathari, by refusing to receive penitent <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>. Novatus, author of this doctrine, was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Cyprian. He wrote, <em>On the passover, On the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, On <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, On the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, On <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a></em>,  <em>On the food of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, On <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, On Attalus</em>, and many others, especially, a great volume <em>On the Trinity</em>, a sort of epitome of the work of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, which many mistakenly ascribe to Cyprian.</p>

<h2>Chapter 71</h2>

<p><span>Malchion</span>,  the highly gifted <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the church at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, who had most successfully taught rhetoric in the same city, held a discussion with <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>, who as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, had introduced the doctrine of Artemon, and this was taken down by short hand writers. This dialogue is still extant, and yet another extended epistle written by him, in behalf of the council, is addressed to <em>Dionysius and Maximus</em>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Rome and Alexandria. He flourished under Claudius and Aurelianus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 72</h2>

<p><span>Archelaus</span>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Mesopotamia, composed in the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac language</a>, a book of the discussion which he held with Manichaeus, when he came from <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. This book, which is translated into Greek, is possessed by many.</p>

<p>He flourished under the Emperor Probus, who succeeded Aurelianus and Tacitus.</p>

We can get an idea of the greatness of his genius from the volume which he wrote <em>On the passover</em> and his ten books <em>On the institutes of arithmetic.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 74</h2>

<p><span>Victorinus</span>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Pettau, was not equally familiar with Latin and Greek. On this account his works though noble in thought, are inferior in style. They are the following: Commentaries <em>On Genesis, On Exodus, On Leviticus, On Isaiah, On Ezekiel, On Habakkuk, On Ecclesiastes, On the Song of Songs, On the Apocalypse of John, Against all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a></em> and many others.

I have twenty-five volumes  of Commentaries of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, written in his hand, <em>On the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a></em> which I hug and guard with such <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that I deem myself to have the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of Croesus. And if it is such <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to have one epistle of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> how much more to have so many thousand lines which seem to me to be traced in his blood. He wrote an <em>Apology for <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a></em> before Eusebius had written his and was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> at <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">C&aelig;sarea in Palestine</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Maximinus.</p>

He was remarkable for his self-discipline, devoted to <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> poverty, and thoroughly acquainted with the dialectic art. After the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, he passed the rest of his life at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There is extant a long treatise of his <em>On the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Hosea</em> which from internal evidence appears to have been delivered on the vigil of <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>.</p>

Works of his, <em>On <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>, and short <em>Epistles</em> to various people are extant. He was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> for his confession of Christ in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Maximinus, and was buried at Helenopolis in Bithynia.</p>

<p><span>Epiphanius</span>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Salamina in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, wrote books <em>Against all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a></em> and many others which are eagerly read by the learned, on account of their subject matter, and also by the plain people, on account of their language.

<p>I once read in Greek a volume by him <em>On the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a></em>, which some one had translated from the Syriac, and recognized even in translation, the incisive power of lofty genius. He died in the reign of <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>.</p>

This latter however, some superscribe with the pseudonym of Herona, since there is another work by Gregory, upbraiding this same Maximus, as if one might not praise and upbraid the same person at one time or another as the occasion may demand. Other works of his are a book in hexameter, containing, <em>A discussion between <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and marriage</em>, two books <em>Against Eunomius</em>, one book <em>On the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a></em>, and one <em>Against the Emperor Julian.</em> He was a follower of Polemon in his style of speaking.

Commentaries of his <em>On the epistles</em> are extant, as well as many other works in the manner of Eusebius the great of Emesa, whose meaning he has followed, but whose eloquence he could not imitate on account of his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of secular literature.</p>

He published many short writings, some of which have reached us. He is still accused by some, of being tainted with Gnosticism, that is, with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> or Mark, of whom <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> writes, while his defenders maintain that he was not at all of this way of thinking.</p>
