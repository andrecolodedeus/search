<h1>Demonstration 21 (Of Persecution)</h1>

<p>1. I have heard a reproach, which has greatly vexed me. The unclean (the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>) say, that this people, which is gathered together out of all nations, has no God. And thus say the impious:&mdash; <q>If they have a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why does He not avenge His people?</q> And darkness more exceedingly has thickened upon me, because the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also reproach us, and magnify themselves over the children of our people. It happened one day, that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is called wise among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, questioned me, saying:&mdash; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Who is called your Teacher, wrote for you, that <em>If there shall be in you <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> like one grain of mustard, you shall say to this mountain, Remove, and it shall remove from before you; and (you shall say) even, Be lifted up and fall into the sea, and it shall <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> you</em>.  So apparently there is in all your people not one wise man, whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is heard, and who asks of God that your persecutors should cease from you. For clearly it is written for you in that passage, <em>There is nothing which you shall not be able to do.</em></p>

<p>2. And when I saw that he was <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> and speaking much against the Way (the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>), my mind was disturbed, and I understood that he would not admit the interpretation of the words that he quoted to me. Then I also questioned him on sayings from the Law and from the Prophets, and said to him:&mdash; Do you trust that even when you are dispersed God is with you? And he professed to me, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is with us, because that God said unto <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>:&mdash; <em>Even in the lands of their enemies, I yet did not forsake them, nor did I make void My covenant with them.</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note371089"><a href="../bible/lev026.htm#verse44">Leviticus&nbsp;26:44</a></span> In answer I said to him:&mdash; <q>Right good is this that I have heard from you, that God is with you. Against your words will I also speak unto you. For I said the Prophet said unto <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as from the mouth of God:&mdash; <em>If you shall pass through the sea, I will be with you, and the rivers shall not overflow you; and if you shall walk upon fire, you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not search you; because the Lord your God is with you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371090"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;43:2-3</a></span> Thus there is not one righteous and good and wise man out of all your people, who could pass through the sea and live and not be drowned; or (through) the river without its overflowing him; or who could walk over fire and see whether he would not be scorched and whether the flame would not burn him. And if you shall bring to me an explanation, I will not be persuaded by you, just as you also do not accept from me the interpretation of the words as to which you have questioned me.</q></p>

<p>3. Furthermore I questioned him about another saying that is written in Ezekiel; namely, that he said to Jerusalem:&mdash; <em><a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a></em>  <em>and her daughters shall be built up as of old, and you and your daughters shall become as of old</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371091"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse55">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:55</a></span> So he explained this saying to me, and began to make a defence, and said to me <q>As to this that God said to Jerusalem by the Prophet, <em><a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and her daughters shall be built up as of old, and you and your daughters shall become as of old;</em> this is the force of the passage, that <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and her daughters shall be in their place as of old, and shall be made subject to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and Jerusalem and her daughters shall be in the splendour of royalty as of old.</q> When I heard this defence from him, it was very contemptible in my eyes, and I said to him:&mdash; <q>Inasmuch as the words of the Prophet were said in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, is the whole passage wrathful, or is part of it wrathful and part of it gracious?</q> He answered:&mdash; <q>A wrathful passage is altogether <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and there is no peace in it.</q> And I said to him:&mdash; Since you have instructed me that there is no peace in that wrathful passage, hear without contention and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> not, and I will instruct you about this saying. For from the top to the bottom the whole passage is said in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. For he said to Jerusalem:&mdash; <em>As I live, says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and her daughters did not do at all as you and your daughters have done</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371092"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse48">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:48</a></span> And he said to her (Jerusalem):&mdash; <em>Be abashed and accept your shame, that you have overcome your sisters in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and they are justified rather than you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371093"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse52">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:52</a></span> Since he says that <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and her daughters were justified rather than Jerusalem and her daughters, and that Jerusalem overcame <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> in her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it is right that when <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be gathered together, its seat should be in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom and Gomorrha</a>. For <em>their vine is of the vine of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and of the planting of Gomorrha. Their grapes are bitter and their clusters gall unto them.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371094"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse32">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:32</a></span> And Isaiah also calls them <em>rulers of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and people of Gomorrha</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371095"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;1:10</a></span> For if <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is gathered together, in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom and Gomorrha</a> ought they to dwell with the rulers of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and with the people of Gomorrha; and on the vine of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and planting of Gomorrha to eat bitter grapes and gather clusters of gall; and to eat the eggs of the basilisk and to clothe themselves with spiders' webs, <span class="stiki" id="note371096"><a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;59:5</a></span> to be used with <em>wild grapes of the vineyard</em>, <span class="stiki" id="note371097"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;5:2</a></span> and to be turned into <em>reprobate silver</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371098"><a href="../bible/jer006.htm#verse30">Jeremiah&nbsp;6:30</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and her daughters, who were justified rather than Jerusalem, shall be built up as of old. And Jerusalem, that surpassed <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> in her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, shall continue in her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <em>and shall remain in desolation until the accomplishment of the things determined for ever.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371099"><a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse27">Daniel&nbsp;9:27</a></span> </p>

<p>4. And Ezekiel said:&mdash; <em>This is the iniquity of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and of her daughters, that they did not take by the hand the poor and needy; and when I saw these things in them, I overthrew them</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371100"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse49">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:49</a></span> And consider and see that, from the time that <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> was overthrown until Jerusalem was built, there were eight hundred and ninety-six years. From the time that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was informed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the Angel that <em>at this time next year I will return to you, and Sarah your wife shall have a son</em>, <span class="stiki" id="note371101"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;18:14</a></span> from that time till Jacob entered <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was a hundred and ninety-one years: and the children of Jacob were in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> two hundred and twenty-five years. So all the years from the time that Isaac was conceived and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> overthrown were four hundred and sixteen years, and from the Exodus of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> till the great edifice of Jerusalem was built up by Solomon, and the temple was built, there were four hundred and eighty years. Therefore all the years from the conception of Isaac and the overthrow of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> till the great building of Jerusalem, were eight hundred and ninety-six years. And from the great building of Jerusalem until the destruction of Jerusalem there were four hundred and twenty-five years. The sum of all the years from the time of the overthrow of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> until Jerusalem was laid waste, was one thousand three hundred and twenty-one. These are all the years that <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and her daughters were laid waste before Jerusalem. And she that was more just than Jerusalem is not yet inhabited. Therefore the whole sum of the years from the overthrow of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> till the six hundred and fifty-fifth year of the Kingdom of Alexander, the son of Philip of Macedon,  is two thousand two hundred and seventy-six years. And from the time that Jerusalem was laid waste by the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a> until the present time is nine hundred and fifty-five years. And Jerusalem has been inhabited, after the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a> laid it waste, during those seventy weeks about which Daniel testified. Then it was laid waste in its last destruction by the Romans, and it shall not be inhabited again for ever, for <em>it abides in desolation until the accomplishment of the things determined</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371103"><a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse27">Daniel&nbsp;9:27</a></span> So then, all the years of the former and latter desolation of Jerusalem have been four hundred and sixty-five years, and when you deduct from them the seventy years of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, they have been three hundred and ninety-five years.</p>

<p>5. All this argument have I written to you, because the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves, (saying), <q>It has been covenanted to us, that we shall be gathered.</q> For if <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, whose iniquity was not so great as that of Jerusalem, is not as yet inhabited, and if we say thus, that it will not be restored for ever, how shall Jerusalem be restored, whose iniquity is greater than that of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and her daughters? As for <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> God has not had mercy on her for two thousand two hundred and seventy-six years; and shall we say that He will have mercy on Jerusalem? For up to the present there are but three hundred and ninety-five years from the day that she was laid waste, according to the calculation that has been written above. But as to this that he said, <em><a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and her daughters shall be possessed as of old</em>, <span class="stiki" id="note371104"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse55">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:55</a></span> and with regard to Jerusalem he said, <em>You and your daughters shall become as of old</em>, this is the force of the passage; that they shall not be inhabited for ever; for the Lord also thus cursed the land against which He was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>:&mdash; <em>It shall not be sown, nor shall it produce, nor shall any herb spring up in it, but it shall be like <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom and Gomorrha</a>, against which the Lord was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and towards which He was not appeased</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371105"><a href="../bible/deu029.htm#verse23">Deuteronomy&nbsp;29:23</a></span> Therefore be sure, my hearer, that <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and her daughters shall not be inhabited for ever; but they shall be as of old, namely, as in that time when they were not as yet inhabited, and as in the time when the Lord was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them and was not appeased towards them. And Jerusalem and her daughters shall be as of old, (that is) as in the former time when the mountain of the Amorites lay in desolation, whereon <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> built the altar, when he bound upon it Isaac his son; and as it was desolate when David bought the threshing-floor from Araunah the Jebusite, and built there the altar. For consider and see that this mountain whereon <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> offered his son is the mountain of Jebus, which is Jerusalem. And this place of the threshing-floor that David bought of Araunah is that whereon the Temple was built. Thus Jerusalem shall be in desolation as of old. And consider that when Ezekiel prophesied this passage, Jerusalem still was sitting in her greatness, and those who were in her were rebelling against the King of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. And that which the Prophet spoke, he said in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and reproach against Jerusalem.</p>

<p>6. Consider and observe, my hearer, that if God had given a hope to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and to her fellows, He would not have overthrown them with fire and brimstone, the sign of the last day of the world, but would have delivered them over to one of the kingdoms to be chastised. As it is written that when Jeremiah caused the nations and kingdoms to drink the cup of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, he said concerning each one of the cities, that after they shall <em>drink the cup, I will turn back the</em>  <em>captivity of Elam, of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, of Zidon, of the children of Ammon, and of Moab</em>, and <em>of Edom</em>.  Concerning each one of these kingdoms he said:&mdash; <em>In the last days I well turn back her captivity.</em> Now we see that <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> was inhabited, and was opulent after she had <em>wandered seventy years</em>,  and after she had received the reward of her harlotries and after she had <em>committed fornication with all kingdoms. </em> And <em>she took the harp, and played it sweetly, and multiplied her music.</em> And also the region of Elam is inhabited and opulent. And with regard to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> Jeremiah said:&mdash; <em><a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> shall fall, and shall not rise</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371108"><a href="../bible/jer051.htm#verse64">Jeremiah&nbsp;51:64</a></span> And lo! unto this day does it continue in desolation, and will do so for ever. And also about Jerusalem he said:&mdash; <em>The virgin of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall fall, and shall not rise again. She is forsaken upon the ground and there is none to raise her up</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371109"><a href="../bible/amo005.htm#verse1">Amos&nbsp;5:1-2</a></span> For if the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which Jeremiah spoke about <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, also that about Jerusalem is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and worthy of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And Isaiah said unto Jerusalem:&mdash; <em>I will not again be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with you, nor will I reprove you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371110"><a href="../bible/isa054.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;54:9</a></span> Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> He will not again be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with her, nor will He reprove her for ever; for that which is in desolation He will not reprove, nor will she provoke him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</p>

<p>7. As to those that reproach us (saying):&mdash; <q>You are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and are not delivered,</q> let them be ashamed themselves, that at every time they have been <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, even for many years before they were delivered. They were made to serve in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> two hundred and twenty-five years. And the Midianites  made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> serve in the days of Barak and Deborah. <span class="stiki" id="note371112"><a href="../bible/jdg004.htm#verse2">Judges&nbsp;4:2</a></span> The Moabites ruled over them in the days of Ehud; <span class="stiki" id="note371113"><a href="../bible/jdg003.htm#verse12">Judges&nbsp;3:12</a></span> the Ammonites in the days of Jephthah; <span class="stiki" id="note371114"><a href="../bible/jdg011.htm#verse5">Judges&nbsp;11:5</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> in the days of Samson, <span class="stiki" id="note371115"><a href="../bible/jdg013.htm#verse1">Judges&nbsp;13:1-24</a></span> and also in the days of Eli and of Samuel the Prophet; <span class="stiki" id="note371116"><a href="../bible/1sa004.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;4:1</a>,&nbsp;sq</span> the Edomites in the days of Ahab; the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> in the days of Hezekiah. <span class="stiki" id="note371117"><a href="../bible/1ki020.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;20:11</a></span> The king of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> uprooted them from their place and dispersed them;  and after he had tried and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> them much, they did not amend, as He said to them:&mdash; <em>In vain have I smitten your sons, for they did not accept chastisement</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371119"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse30">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:30</a></span> And again He said:&mdash; <em>I have cut off the Prophets, and slain them by the word of My mouth.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371120"><a href="../bible/hos006.htm#verse5">Hosea&nbsp;6:5</a></span> And to Jerusalem He said:&mdash; <em>By afflictions and scourges be instructed, O Jerusalem, lest your life depart from you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371121"><a href="../bible/jer006.htm#verse7">Jeremiah&nbsp;6:7-8</a></span> But they forsook Him, and worshipped <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, as Jeremiah said concerning them: <span class="stiki" id="note371122"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:10-13</a></span> &mdash; <em>Go to the distant isles, and send to Kedar, and consider well and see, whether there has been (anything) like this, whether the nations change their gods, those that are no gods. But My people has changed My <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for that which is not profitable. Be astonished, you heavens, at this; and quake and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> greatly, says the Lord; because My people have done two wickednesses; they have abandoned Me, the fountain of the water of life, and they have gone and dug for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns which cannot hold water.</em> For the broken cisterns are the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of images and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. And He calls the heavens to astonishment, because they worshipped the hosts of the heavens. And the heavens shall receive as a penalty, that <em>they shall be rolled up as a scroll, and all the host of them shall fall down.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371123"><a href="../bible/isa034.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;34:4</a></span> </p>

<p>8. All this discourse that I have written unto you, my beloved, from the beginning, was because the Jew reproached the children of our people; but now, as far as I can comprehend, I will instruct you about the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, that they have received a great reward, while the persecutors have come to scorn and contempt.</p>

<p>9. Jacob was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> was a persecutor. Jacob received the blessings and the birthright, while <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> was cast out from both. Joseph was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and his brothers were persecutors; Joseph was exalted and his persecutors bowed down before him, and so his dreams and his visions were fulfilled. Joseph who was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> was a type of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. His father clothed Joseph in a tunic of various colours; and His Father clothed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> with a body (taken) from the Virgin. His father loved Joseph more than his brethren, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the dear and beloved one of His Father. Joseph saw visions and dreamed dreams; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> fulfilled the visions and the Prophets. Joseph was a shepherd with his brethren; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Chief of Shepherds. When his father sent Joseph to visit his brethren, they saw him coming and plotted to kill him; and when His Father sent <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to visit His brethren, they said:&mdash; <em>This is the heir; come, let us kill him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371124"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;21:38</a></span> His brethren cast Joseph into the pit; and His brethren brought down <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> into the abode of the dead. Joseph ascended from the pit and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> arose from the abode of the dead. Joseph, after he arose from the pit, had authority over his brethren; and after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> arose from the abode of the dead, His Father gave Him a great and excellent name, <span class="stiki" id="note371125"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse9">Philippians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> that His brethren should serve Him, and His enemies be put beneath His feet. After that Joseph was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to his brethren, they were abashed and feared and were amazed at his greatness; and when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> shall come at the last time, when He shall be revealed in His Majesty, His brethren will be abashed and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and be dismayed before Him, because they crucified Him. Moreover, Joseph, by the counsel of Judah, was sold into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, by the hands of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, was delivered over to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. When they sold Joseph, he answered nothing to his brethren; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> also spoke not and gave no answer to the judges who judged Him. His master wrongfully delivered over Joseph to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; and His countrymen wrongfully condemned <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. Joseph delivered over his two garments, one into the hand of his brethren, and the other into the hand of his master's wife; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> delivered over His garments and divided them between the soldiers. Joseph, when thirty years old, stood before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> and became lord of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, when about thirty years old, came to the Jordan to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and received the spirit, and went forth to preach. Joseph nourished <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with bread; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> nourished the whole world with the bread of life. Joseph took to wife the daughter of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and unclean <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> espoused to Himself the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (taken) from the unclean <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Joseph died and was buried in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died and was buried in Jerusalem. Joseph's bones his brethren brought up from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> His Father raised from the abode of the dead, and took up His Body with Him to heaven uncorrupted.</p>

<p>10. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. When <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was born, they concealed him that he might not be slain by his persecutors. When Jesus was born they carried Him off in flight into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, His persecutor, might not slay Him. In the days when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was born, children used to be drowned in the river; and at the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the children of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> and in its borders were slain. To <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> God said:&mdash; <em>The men are dead who were seeking your life</em>; <span class="stiki" id="note371126"><a href="../bible/exo004.htm#verse10">Exodus&nbsp;4:10</a></span> and to Joseph the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>:&mdash; <em>Arise, take up the child, and go into the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, for they are dead who were seeking the life of the child to take it away</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371127"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;2:20</a></span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> brought out his people from the service of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>; and Jesus delivered all nations from the service of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> grew up in <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> house; and Jesus grew up in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> when Joseph brought Him there in flight. Miriam  stood on the edge of the river when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was floating in the water; and Mary bare Jesus, after the Angel Gabriel had made the annunciation to her. When <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> the lamb, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were slain; and when they crucified Jesus the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lamb, the people who slew Him perished through His slaying. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> brought down manna for his people; and Jesus gave His Body to the nations. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> sweetened the bitter waters by the wood; and Jesus sweetened our bitterness by His cross, by the wood of the tree of His crucifixion. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> brought down the Law to his people; and Jesus gave His covenants to the nations. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> conquered Amalek by the spreading out of his hands; and Jesus conquered <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> by the sign of His cross. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> brought out water from the rock for his people; and Jesus sent Simon Cephas (the rock) to carry His doctrine among the nations. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> lifted up the veil from his face and spoke with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and Jesus lifted up the veil from the face of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, that they might hear and receive His doctrine. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> laid his hand upon his messengers (<a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>), and they received <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; and Jesus laid His hand upon His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> ascended the mountain and died there; and Jesus ascended into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of His Father.</p>

<p>11. Also Joshua the son of Nun was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> as Jesus our Redeemer was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Joshua the son of Nun was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the unclean nations; and Jesus our Redeemer was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the foolish people. Joshua the son of Nun took away the inheritance from his persecutors and gave it to his people; and Jesus our Redeemer took away the inheritance from His persecutors and gave it to strange nations. Joshua the son of Nun caused the sun to stand still in the heavens, and took vengeance on the nations his persecutors; and Jesus our Redeemer caused the sun to set in the midst of the day, that the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> people which crucified Him might be ashamed. Joshua the son of Nun divided the inheritance unto his people; and Jesus our Redeemer has promised to give to the nations the land of life. Joshua the son of Nun caused Rahab the harlot to live; and Jesus our Redeemer gathered together and gave life to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, though polluted by the harlotry (of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>). Joshua the son of Nun on the seventh day overthrew and cast down the walls of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>; and Jesus our Redeemer, on His seventh day, on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> of the rest of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this world shall be dissolved and fall. Joshua the son of Nun <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> Achor, because he stole of the accursed thing; and Jesus our Redeemer separated Judas from the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, His friends, because he stole of the money of the poor. Joshua the son of Nun, when he was dying, laid down a testimony among his people; and Jesus our Redeemer, when He was taken up, laid down a testimony among His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>

<p>12. Also Jephthah was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Jephthah, his brethren drove out from the house of his father; and Jesus, His brethren drove out and lifted up and crucified. Jephthah though <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> arose as leader to his people; Jesus though <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> arose and became King of the Nations. Jephthah vowed a vow and offered up his <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> daughter as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was lifted up as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to his Father for all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<p>13. Also David was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. David was anointed by Samuel to be king instead of Saul who had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was anointed by John to be High Priest instead of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the ministers of the Law. David was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> after his anointing; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> after His anointing. David reigned first over one tribe only, and afterwards over all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and Jesus reigned from the beginning over the few who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, and in the end He will reign over all the world. Samuel anointed David when he was thirty years old; and Jesus when about thirty years old received the imposition of the hand from John. David wedded two daughters of the king; and Jesus wedded two daughters of kings, the congregation of the People and the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. David repaid good to Saul his enemy; and Jesus taught,  <em>Pray for your enemies</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371129"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;6:28</a></span> David was the heart of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note371130"><a href="../bible/1sa013.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;13:14</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. David received the kingdom of Saul his persecutor; and Jesus received the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His persecutor. David wept with dirges over Saul his enemy when he died; and Jesus wept over Jerusalem, His persecutor, which was to be laid waste. David handed over the kingdom to Solomon, and was gathered to his people; and Jesus handed over the keys to Simon, and ascended and returned to Him who sent Him. For David's sake, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were forgiven to his posterity; and for Jesus' sake <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven to the nations. </p>

<p>14. Elijah also was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a> the murderess <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Elijah; and the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> and murderous congregation <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Jesus. Elijah restrained the heavens from rain because of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and Jesus by His coming restrained the Spirit from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, because of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people. Elijah destroyed the servants of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>; and Jesus trampled upon <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and his hosts. Elijah raised to life the son of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>; and Jesus raised to life the son of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, as well as Lazarus and the daughter of the ruler of the Synagogue. Elijah sustained the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> with a little bread; and Jesus satisfied thousands with a little bread. Elijah was taken up in a chariot to heaven; and our Redeemer ascended and took His seat on the right hand of His Father. Elisha received the spirit of Elijah; and Jesus breathed upon the faces of His Apostles.</p>

<p>15. Also Elisha was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Elisha was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the son of Ahab, the son of the murderer; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the murderous people. Elisha prophesied, and there came about abundance in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>; and Jesus said:&mdash; <em>Whosoever eats of My body and drinks of My blood shall live for ever.</em> Elisha satisfied a hundred men with a little bread; and Jesus satisfied four thousand men, besides <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, with five loaves. Elisha made oil out of water; and Jesus made wine out of water. Elisha delivered the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> from her creditor; and Jesus delivered the indebted nations. Elisha made the iron to swim and the wood to sink; and Jesus raised up that which was sunk in us, and sank that which was light. A dead man (laid) upon the bones of Elisha recovered life; and all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, who were dead in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, were cast upon the bones of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and recovered life.</p>

<p>16. Hezekiah also was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Hezekiah was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and was reproached by Sennacherib his enemy; Jesus also was reproached by the foolish people. Hezekiah <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and overcame his adversary; and by the crucifixion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was our Adversary overcome. Hezekiah was king of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and Jesus is King of all the nations. Because Hezekiah was sick, the sun turned backwards; and because Jesus suffered, the sun was darkened from its light. The enemies of Hezekiah became dead corpses; and Jesus, His enemies shall be cast down beneath His feet. Hezekiah was of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the house of David; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was, in the flesh, the son of David. Hezekiah said:&mdash; <em>Peace and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall be in my days</em>; <span class="stiki" id="note371132"><a href="../bible/2ki020.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;20:19</a></span> and Jesus said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>:&mdash; <em>My peace I leave with you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371133"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;14:27</a></span> Hezekiah <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and was healed of his sickness; Jesus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and arose from the abode of the dead. Hezekiah after he arose from his sickness added to his years; and Jesus after His Resurrection received great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Hezekiah, after the prolongation of his life, death was given dominion over him; but Jesus, after that He rose, death shall not again have dominion over Him for ever.</p>

<p>17. Josiah also was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Josiah was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> the Lame  slew Him; <span class="stiki" id="note371135"><a href="../bible/2ki023.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;23:29</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and the people that were made lame by their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> slew Him. Josiah cleansed the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from uncleanness; and Jesus cleansed and caused to pass away uncleanness from all the earth. Josiah hallowed and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the name of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and Jesus said:&mdash; <em>I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> and will glorify (His Name</em>). <span class="stiki" id="note371136"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;12:28</a></span> Josiah because of the iniquity of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <em>rent his clothes</em>; <span class="stiki" id="note371137"><a href="../bible/2ki022.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;22:11,&nbsp;13</a></span> and Jesus because of the iniquity of the people <em>rent the veil of the Holy Temple</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371138"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse51">Matthew&nbsp;27:51</a></span> Josiah said:&mdash; <em>Great is the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> that shall come upon this people;</em> and Jesus said:&mdash; <em>There shall come <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon this people, and they shall fall by the edge of the sword</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371139"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;21:23-24</a></span> Josiah cast out uncleanness from the Holy Temple; and Jesus cast out the unclean traders from His Father's house.

<p>18. Daniel also was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Daniel was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the Chaldeans, the congregation of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> men; Jesus also the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the congregation of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Daniel the Chaldeans accused; and Jesus the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> accused before the governor. Daniel they cast into the pit of lions, and he was delivered and came up out of its midst uninjured; and Jesus they sent down into the pit of the abode of the dead, and He ascended, and death had not dominion over him. Concerning Daniel they expected that when he had fallen into the pit he would not come up again; and concerning Jesus they said, <em>Since He has fallen, He shall not rise again</em>.  From (harming) Daniel the mouth of the ravenous and destructive lions was closed; and from (harming) Jesus was closed the mouth of death, (though) ravenous and destructive of (living) forms. They sealed the pit of Daniel, and guarded it with diligence; and the grave of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did they guard with diligence, as they said, <em>Set guards to watch al the tomb</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371143"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse64">Matthew&nbsp;27:64</a></span> When Daniel came up, his accusers were ashamed; and when Jesus rose, all they who had crucified Him were ashamed.

When Daniel explained the vision of Belteshazzar, he received authority over the third part of the kingdom; and when Jesus fulfilled the visions and the Prophets, His Father delivered unto Him all authority in heaven and in earth. Daniel saw wonders and uttered secrets; and Jesus revealed secrets and fulfilled what is written. Daniel was led away among the hostages in behalf of his people; and the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was a hostage in behalf of all nations. For Daniel's sake the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the King was appeased from the Chaldeans, so that they were not slain; and for Jesus' sake the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of His Father was appeased from all nations, so that they were not slain and died not because of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Daniel <em>besought of the king, and he gave his brethren authority over the affairs of the province of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a></em>; <span class="stiki" id="note371146"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse49">Daniel&nbsp;2:49</a></span> and Jesus besought of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He gave His brethren, His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, authority over <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and his host.  Daniel said concerning Jerusalem, that until the things determined, she should remain in desolation; and Jesus said concerning Jerusalem, <em>There shall not be left in her stone upon stone, because she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the day of her greatness</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371148"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;19:44</a></span> Daniel foresaw the weeks that should remain over for his people; and Jesus came and fulfilled them.</p>

<p>19. Hananiah also and his brethren were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Hananiah and his brethren were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Hananiah and his brethren were cast into the furnace of fire, and it was cold as dew upon the righteous. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> also descended to the place of darkness, and burst its gates and brought forth its prisoners. Hananiah and his brethren came up from the furnace of fire, and the flame burned their accusers; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> revived and came up from the midst of darkness, and His accusers and they that crucified Him shall be burned in flames at the end. When Hananiah and his brethren came up from the furnace, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> the King trembled and was amazed; and when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> arose from the abode of the dead, the people that crucified Him were terrified and trembled. Hananiah and his brethren worshipped not the image of the King of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> restrained the nations from the worship of dead images. Because of Hananiah and his brethren, the <em>nations and languages <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> God Who had delivered them from the fire</em>: <span class="stiki" id="note371149"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse28">Daniel&nbsp;3:28-29</a></span> and because of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the nations and oil languages shall glorify (God) Who delivered His Son, so that He saw no corruption. On the garments of Hananiah and his brethren the fire had no power; and on the bodies of the righteous, who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the fire shall have no power at the end. </p>

<p>20. Mordecai also was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Mordecai was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> Haman; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the rebellious People. Mordecai by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> delivered his people from the hands of Haman; and Jesus by His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> delivered His people from the hands of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. Mordecai was delivered from the hands of his persecutor; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was rescued from the hands of His persecutors. Because Mordecai sat and clothed himself with sackcloth, he saved Esther and his people from the sword; and because Jesus clothed Himself with a body and was illuminated, He saved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her children from death. Because of Mordecai, Esther was well pleasing to the king, and went in and sat instead of Vashti, who did not do his will; and because of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and has gone in to the king, instead of the congregation which did not His Will. Mordecai admonished Esther that she should fast with her maidens, that she and her people might be delivered from the hands of Haman; and Jesus admonished the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her children (to fast), that she and her children might be delivered from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. Mordecai received the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Haman, his persecutor; and Jesus received great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from His Father, instead of His persecutors who were of the foolish People. Mordecai trod upon the neck of Haman, his persecutor; and as for Jesus, His enemies shall be put under His feet. Before Mordecai, Haman proclaimed, <em>Thus shall it be done to the man, in honouring whom the king is pleased</em>; <span class="stiki" id="note371151"><a href="../bible/est006.htm#verse11">Esther&nbsp;6:11</a></span> and as for Jesus, His preachers came out of the People that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Him, and they said:&mdash; <em>This is Jesus the San of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371152"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse54">Matthew&nbsp;27:54</a></span> The blood of Mordecai was required at the hand of Haman and his sons;  and <em>the blood of Jesus</em>, His persecutors took <em>upon themselves and upon their children</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371154"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;27:25</a></span> </p>

<p>21. These memorials that I have written unto you, my beloved, concerning Jesus Who was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and the righteous who were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, are in order that those who today are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Jesus, may be comforted, for He wrote for us and comforted us Himself; for He said:&mdash; <em>If they have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Me, they will also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you. And because of this they will <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you, that you are not of the world, even as I was not of it</em>.  For He wrote before for us:&mdash; <em>Your fathers and your brothers and your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> will deliver you up, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you for My name's sake.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371156"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;21:16-17</a></span> And again He taught us:&mdash; <em>When they shall bring you before rulers and before magistrates, and before</em>  <em>kings that hold the world, meditate not before the time what you shall say, and how you shall make defence; and I will give you a mouth and wisdom, that your enemies may not be able to overcome you, because it is not you that speak, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of your Father; He shall speak in you</em>.  This is the spirit which spoke by the mouth of Jacob to <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, his persecutor; and the spirit of wisdom which spoke before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Joseph; and the spirit which spoke by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in all the prodigies which he did in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which was given to Joshua, the son of Nun, when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> laid his hand upon him, so that the nations which <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> him came to a complete end before him; and the spirit that uttered psalms by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> David, by which he used to sing psalms and soothe Saul his persecutor from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit; and the spirit which clothed Elijah, and through him reproved <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a> and Ahab his persecutor; and the spirit which spoke in Elisha, and prophesied and made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the king his persecutor about all that was to happen thereafter; and the spirit which was fervent in the mouth of Micaiah when he reproved Ahab his persecutor saying:&mdash; <em>If you shall at all return back, the Lord has not spoken by me</em>; <span class="stiki" id="note371158"><a href="../bible/1ki022.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;22:28</a></span> and the spirit which strengthened Jeremiah, so that he stood boldly, and by it reproved Zedekiah; and the spirit that preserved Daniel and his brethren in the land of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>; and the spirit that delivered Mordecai and Esther in the place of their captivity.</p>

<p>22. Hear, my beloved, these names of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, of confessors, and of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Abel was murdered, and his blood cried out from the earth. Jacob was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and fled and became an exile. Joseph was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and sold and cast into the pit. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and fled to Midian. Joshua the son of Nun was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Jephthah and Samson and Gideon and Barak, these also were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. These are they of whom the blessed Apostle said:&mdash; <em>Time fails me to narrate their victories.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371159"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse32">Hebrews&nbsp;11:32</a>,&nbsp;sq</span> David also was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> at the hands of Saul, and he walked <em>in the mountains and in dens, and in caves</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371160"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse38">Hebrews&nbsp;11:38</a></span> Samuel also was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and mourned over Saul. Furthermore Hezekiah was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and bound up in affliction. Elijah was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and walked in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. Elisha was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and became an exile; and Micaiah was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Jeremiah was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and they cast him into the pit of mire. Daniel was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and cast into the pit of lions. Hananiah also and his brethren were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and cast into the furnace of fire. Mordecai and Esther and the children of their people were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, at the hands of Haman. Judas Maccab&aelig;us and his brethren were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and they also endured reproach. The seven brethren, sons of the blessed <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, endured torments by bitter scourgings, <span class="stiki" id="note371161"><a href="../bible/2ma007.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;7:1</a>,&nbsp;sq</span> and were confessors and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and Eleazar, aged and advanced in years as he was, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a noble example and made (his) confession and became a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note371162"><a href="../bible/2ma006.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;6:18</a>,&nbsp;sq</span> </p>

<p>23. Great and excellent is the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. He surpassed in affliction and in confession all who were before or after. And after Him was the faithful <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Stephen whom the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>. Simon (Peter) also and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> were perfect <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. And James and John walked in the footsteps of their Master Christ. Also (others) of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> thereafter in various places confessed and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. And also concerning our brethren who are in the West, in the days of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> there came great affliction and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> to the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which was in all their region. The Churches were overthrown and uprooted, and many confessors and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> made confession. And (the Lord) turned in mercy to them after they were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. And also in our days these things happened to us also on account of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but also that what is written might be fulfilled, even as our Redeemer said:&mdash; <em>These things are to be</em>.  The Apostle also said:&mdash; <em>Also over us is set this cloud of confession</em>; <span class="stiki" id="note371164"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;11:1</a></span> which (is) our <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, wherein many confess and are slain.</p>
