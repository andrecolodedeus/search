<h1>Demonstration 22 (Of Death and the 50atter Times)</h1>

<p>1. The upright and righteous and good and wise <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not nor tremble at death, because of the great hope that is before them. And they at every time are mindful of death, their exodus, and of the last day in which the children of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> shall be judged. They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that by the sentence of judgment death has held sway, because <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> transgressed the commandment; as the Apostle said:&mdash; <em>Death ruled from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> even over those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not, so that also upon all the children of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> it passed</em>,  even as it passed upon Adam. And how did death rule from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? Clearly, when God laid down the commandment for Adam, He warned him, and said:&mdash; <em>On the day that you shall eat of the tree of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, you shall die the death.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371166"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;2:17</a></span> So when he transgressed the commandment and ate of the tree, death ruled over him and over all his progeny. Even over those who had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, even over them did death rule through Adam's transgression of the commandment.</p>

<p>2. And why did he say:&mdash; <em>From <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did Death rule? </em> And who is so ill-furnished with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that only from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> has death had dominion? Yet let him understand from this that he said:&mdash; <em>Upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> it passed.</em> Thus, upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> it passed from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> until the world shall end. Yet <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> preached that its kingdom is made void. For when <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> transgressed the commandment whereby the sentence of death was passed upon his progeny, Death hoped that he would bind fast all the sons of man and would be king over them for ever. But when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> came, he proclaimed the resurrection, and Death <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that his kingdom is to be made void. For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said:&mdash; <em>Reuben shall live and not die, and shall be in number</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371167"><a href="../bible/deu033.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;33:6</a></span> And when the Holy One called <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> from the bush he said thus to him:&mdash; <em>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, of Isaac, and of Jacob</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371168"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;3:6</a></span> When Death heard this utterance, he trembled and feared and was terrified and was perturbed, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he had not become king for ever over the children of Adam. From the hour that he heard God saying to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>:&mdash; <em>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, of Isaac, and of Jacob</em>, Death smote his hands together, for he learned that God is King of the dead and of the living, and that it is appointed to the children of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to come forth from his darkness, and arise with their bodies. And observe that our Redeemer Jesus also, when He repeated this utterance to the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, when they were disputing with Him about the Resurrection of the dead, thus said:&mdash; <em>God is not (God) of the dead, for all are alive unto Him.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371169"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;20:38</a></span> </p>

<p>3. And that God might make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Death that his authority is not for ever over all the progeny of the world, He translated <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> to Himself, because he was well-pleasing, and made him deathless. And again He took up Elijah to heaven, and Death had no dominion over him. And Hannah said:&mdash; <em>The Lord makes to die and causes to live; He brings down to Sheol and raises up</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371170"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;2:6</a></span> Furthermore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said as from the mouth of God:&mdash; <em>I make to die and I <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to live</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371171"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse39">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:39</a></span> Again the Prophet Isaiah also said:&mdash; <em>Your dead shall live, and their dead bodies shall rise again; and the sleepers of the dust shall be awakened, and shall glorify You</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371172"><a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;26:19</a></span> When Death heard all these things, amazement  seized him, and he sat him down in mourning.</p>

<p>4. And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the slayer of Death, came, and clothed Himself in a Body from the seed of Adam, and was crucified in His Body, and tasted death; and when (Death) perceived thereby that He had come down unto him, he was shaken from his place and was agitated when he saw Jesus; and he closed his gates and was not willing to receive Him. Then He burst his gates, and entered into him, and began to despoil all his possessions. But when the dead saw light in the darkness, they lifted up their heads from the bondage of death, and looked forth, and saw the splendour of the King Messiah. Then the powers of the darkness of Death sat in mourning, for he was degraded from his authority. Death tasted the medicine that was deadly to him, and his hands dropped down, and he learned that the dead shall live and escape from his sway. And when He had afflicted Death by the despoiling of his possessions, he wailed and cried aloud in bitterness and said, <q>Go forth from my realm and enter it not. Who then is this that comes in alive into my realm?</q> And while Death was crying out in terror (for he saw that his darkness was beginning to be done away, and some of the righteous who were sleeping arose to ascend with Him), then He made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him that when He shall come in the fullness of time, He will bring forth all the prisoners from his power, and they shall go forth to see the light. Then when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had fulfilled His ministry among the dead, Death sent Him forth from his realm, and suffered Him not to remain there. And to devour Him like all the dead, he counted it not pleasure. He had no power over the Holy One, nor was He given over to corruption.</p>

<p>5. And when he had eagerly sent Him forth and He had come forth from his realm, He left with him, as a poison, the promise of life; that little by little his power should be done away. Even as when a man has taken a poison in the food which is given for (the support of) life, when he perceives in himself that he has received poison in the food, then he casts up again from his belly the food in which poison was mingled; but the drug leaves its power in his limbs, so that little by little the structure of his body is dissolved and corrupted. So Jesus dead was the bringer to nought of Death; for through Him life is made to reign, and through Him Death is abolished, to whom it is said:&mdash; <em>O Death, where is your victory?</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371173"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse55">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:55</a></span> </p>

<p>6. Therefore, you children of Adam, all you over whom Death has ruled, be mindful of Death and remember life; and transgress not the commandment as your first father did. O Kings, crowned with the diadem, remember Death, which will take away the diadems that are set upon your heads, and he shall be king over you till the time, when you shall rise again for the judgment. O you <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> and uplifted and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, remember Death, which shall destroy your haughtiness, and dissolve the limbs, and separate the joints, and the body and its forms shall be given over to corruption. The lofty ones shall be brought low by Death, and the fierce and stern ones shall be buried away in his darkness. He shall take away all the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and they shall corrupt away and become dust, until the judgment. O you rich, remember Death; for when the time shall come and you shall draw near to him there, you shall not use your <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and possessions. He will not place dainty viands before you, nor will he prepare for you a rich banquet. There the body of the <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttons</a> who used to live delicately shall be corrupted. They shall cease from their luxury and shall not remember it. There the worm shall consume their bodies, and they shall clothe themselves in darkness over their fair apparel. They remember not the ending of this world, that Death shall confound them when they descend to him. So they shall sit in oppression and in the shadow of death, and shall not remember this world, until the end shall be and they shall rise again for the judgment. O you rapacious and extortioners and plunderers of your fellows, remember Death, and multiply not your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for in that place sinners repent not; and he who has plundered his fellows' goods shall not possess his own, but shall go to the place where man shall make no use of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. And he shall come to nought and pass away from his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall be laid up against the day of judgment.</p>

<p>7. O you that trust in this world, let this world be despised in your eyes; for you are sojourners and aliens in the midst of it, and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the day that you shall be taken out of it. For suddenly shall Death come, and separate and lead away the loved children from their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> from their darling children. He leads away for himself the precious only-begotten children, and their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> shall be deprived of them and shall come into contempt. He separates precious friends unto himself, and their beloved weep for them lamentably. He leads away and takes prisoners unto himself them that are desired for their beauty, that he may put to shame their forms and corrupt them. And those that are <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> in aspect he leads away to himself, and they become dust until the judgment. He leads away <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> maidens from their spouses, and binds them captive in his bridal-chamber, in his place of gloom. He leads away and separates <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> husbands from the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who were designed for them and <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> in their name; and these shall sit in bitter mourning over them. He leads away and separates unto himself all the beautiful youths who supposed that even unto old age they would not see death. He leads away and gathers unto himself the loved infants of days, with whom their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were not satiated. He leads away to himself the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, the sons of luxury; And <em>they leave their possessions as the waves of the sea</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371174"><a href="../bible/sir029.htm#verse18">Sirach&nbsp;29:18</a></span> He leads away to himself the skilful artificers, who were raising up the world by their <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>. He leads away to himself the subtle and the wise, and they become simple, not distinguishing good from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. He leads away to himself the richly endowed of this world, and their endowments are destroyed and shall not be established for ever. He leads away to himself the mighty and the great ones, and their might is brought low and weakened, and comes to an end. Them that were confident that their might would not be brought lower, in the day of death, men that are of lower degree than theirs gather together their bodies. They that trust that in their death they shall be buried with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, it befalls them that the dogs devour them. And they that trust that they shall be buried in the place wherein they were born, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not but that in the land of their captivity they shall even be gathered (to the grave) with insult. They that trusted in their possessions, that they should give them in inheritance to their children, from them it is hidden that they shall be plundered by their enemies. Death leads away to himself the brave and the warriors. who thought to lay waste the great world. Death leads away them that adorn themselves with all pleasant things, and the burial of an ass befalls them when they are buried. Death rules over the unborn, and takes them captive to himself before they are born. Death leads away to himself them that are honoured with pomps, and they come into contempt when they descend to him, to the realm of darkness, where there is no light. He is not ashamed before Kings (that are) crowned with the diadem. He is not abashed before the lofty and the fierce ones who lay waste the lands. Death respects not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, nor does he receive a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> from the rich. Death despises not the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, nor does his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> scorn him that has nothing. Death honours not them that live in magnificence, nor with him are the good distinguished from the bad. He takes no account of the aged, rather than of children in respect of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The lords of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> he makes without understanding, and them that used to make haste and vex themselves, in acquiring possessions there with him, these are stripped of their gains. He leads away to himself slaves and their masters; and there the masters are not honoured more than their servants. <em>Small and great are there, and they hear not the voice of the oppressor. The slave who is freed from his master</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371175"><a href="../bible/job003.htm#verse18">Job&nbsp;3:18-19</a></span> there pays no regard to him who used to oppress him. Death binds and makes captive to himself the keepers of prisoners, and the prisoners who were shut up. By means of Death the prisoners are released, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not again because of their oppressors.</p>

<p>8. They that live daintily <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death; but the afflicted look forward with hope that they shall be speedily taken away. All the rich tremble because of death; but the poor desire it, that they may rest from their labour. Death terrifies the mighty when they remember him; but the sick look forward with hope to him that through him they may forget their pains. Again the young children are afraid of death, for when it comes upon them they shall leave their pleasures; but the old men advanced in years <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for it, they that are in need of daily bread.</p>

<p>9. The sons of peace remember death; and they forsake and remove from them <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and enmity. As sojourners they dwell in this world, and prepare for themselves a provision for the journey before them. On that which is above they set their thoughts, on that which is above they meditate; and those things which are beneath their eyes they despise. They send away their treasures to the place where there is no peril, the place where there is no moth, nor are there thieves. They abide in the world as aliens, sons of a far land; and look forward to be sent out of this world and to come to the city, the place of the righteous. They afflict themselves in the place of their sojourning; and they are not entangled or occupied in the house of their exile. Ever day by day their faces are set upwards, to go to the repose of their fathers. As prisoners are they in this world, and as hostages of the King are they kept. To the end they have no rest in this world, nor is (their) hope in it, that it will continue for ever. They that acquire possessions, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> not in them, and they that beget children, death fills them with sorrow. They that build cities, shall not be left in them; and those that hasten and toil for anything, are in no wise to be distinguished from fools. O man without sense, whosoever he be whose trust is in this world!</p>

<p>10. Remember, my beloved, and compare and consider in your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, who is there of former generations who has been left in this world so as to continue for ever? Death has led away the former generations, the great ones and the mighty and the subtle. Who is there that acquired great possessions, and at the time when he departed took them with him? That which was gathered together from the earth returns back into its bosom; and naked does a man depart from his possessions. The wise, when they acquire goods, send some of them before them, as Job said:&mdash; <em>My witnesses are heaven;</em> and again:&mdash; <em>My brethren and my lovers are with God</em>.  And our Lord commanded them that acquire possessions to <em>make for themselves friends</em> in heaven, and also to <em>lay up treasures</em> there. </p>

<p>11. Remember also death, O wise scribe, that your heart be not lifted up, so that you should forget the sentence of judgment. Death leaves not aside the wise, nor respects the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the subtle. Death leads away to himself the wise <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, so that they forget that which they have learned, until the time comes in which all the righteous shall rise again.</p>

<p>12. In that place they shall forget this world. There they have no want; and they shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another with an abundant <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. In their bodies there shall be no heaviness, and lightly shall they fly <em>as</em>  <em>doves to their windows</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371178"><a href="../bible/isa060.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;60:8</a></span> In their thoughts they shall not there remember <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> at all, nor shall anything of uncleanness arise in their heart. In that place there shall be no natural desire, for there they shall be weaned from all appetites. There shall not arise in their heart <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or lasciviousness; also they shall remove from them all things that gender <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Fervent in their heart will be the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of each other; and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> will not be fixed within them at all. They shall have no need there to build houses, for they shall abide in light, in the mansions of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. They shall have no need of woven raiment, for they shall be clothed in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light. They shall have no need of food, for they shall recline at His table and be nurtured for ever. The air of that region is pleasant and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and its light shines out, and is goodly and gladsome. Planted there are beautiful trees, whose fruits fail not, and whose leaves fall not. Their boughs are <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, their perfume delightful, and of their taste no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall grow weary for ever. Spacious is the region, nor is it limited; yet its inhabitants shall see its distance even as that which is near. There the inheritance shall not be divided, and no man shall say to his fellow:&mdash; <q>This is mine and that is yours.</q> They shall not be bound there in the desire of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, nor shall they go astray there concerning remembrance. There a man shall not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his neighbour with special reverence, but abundantly shall they all <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another after one fashion. They shall not marry wives there, nor shall they beget children; nor shall there the male be distinguished from the female; but all shall be sons of their Father Who is in heaven; as the Prophet said:&mdash; <em>Is there not one Father of us all; is there not one God Who created us?</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371179"><a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse10">Malachi&nbsp;2:10</a></span> </p>

<p>13. And as regards that which I said; that there they shall not take wives, nor is male distinguished from female, our Lord and His Apostles have taught us. For our Lord said:&mdash; <em>They that are worthy of that world, and of that resurrection from the abode of the dead, shall not take wives, nor shall (<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>) become wives to men; for they cannot die; but they are as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in heaven, and are the children of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371180"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;20:35-36</a></span> And the apostle said:&mdash; <em>There is neither male nor female, neither bond nor free; but you are all one in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371181"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse28">Galatians&nbsp;3:28</a></span> For, as for Eve, to spread abroad generation, God took her out from Adam, that she might become the mother of all living; but yet in that world there is no female; even as in heaven also there is no female, nor generation, nor use of concupiscence. In that place there is no deficiency, but fullness and perfection. The aged shall not die and the young shall not grow old. And it is in expectation of growing old and dying that young men take wives and beget children, that when the fathers shall have died the children may rise up in their stead. Now all these things have their use only in this world, for in that place there is no want, nor any deficiency, nor concupiscence, nor generation, nor ending, nor failure, nor death, nor termination, nor old age. There is neither <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, nor weariness, nor toil, nor darkness, nor night, nor <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. There is not in that place any want at all; but it is full of light, and life, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and fullness, and satisfaction and renewal, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and all the good promises that are written but not yet <em>sealed</em>. For there is there that <em>which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which has not come up into the heart of man</em>, <span class="stiki" id="note371182"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> that which is unspeakable and which a man cannot utter. And the Apostle said:&mdash; <em>That which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has prepared for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371183"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> Though men shall say much, they shall not be able to express it. That which eye has not seen, they are unable to relate; and that which ear has not heard, it is not right to speak of in such wise as to compare it with anything that the ear has heard and the eye has seen. And that which has not come up unto the heart, who is there dares to speak of it, as though it was like anything that has come up into the heart? But this is right for a speaker, to liken and call that place the abode of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the place of life, the perfect place, the place of light, the place of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the day of rest, the repose of the righteous, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the just, the abode and dwelling-place of the righteous and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, the place of our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, the sure abode of our trust, the place of our treasure, the place that shall assuage our weariness and remove our afflictions, and soothe our sighs. To these things it is right for us to liken, and thus to call, that place.</p>

<p>14. Again, Death leads away to himself kings, the founders of cities, who strengthen themselves in splendour. And he does not leave aside the Lords of the countries. Death leads away and takes captive to himself the avaricious who are not satisfied nor say <q>Enough</q>; and he is greedy for them with a greater greed than theirs. Death leads away to himself the despoilers who were not by their <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> restrained from despoiling their fellows. Death leads away to himself the oppressors, and through death are they restrained from iniquity. Death leads away to himself the persecutors, and the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> have rest till they go to him. Death leads away to himself them that swallow up their fellows, and the down-trodden and oppressed have rest for a little until they themselves also are led away and go there. Death leads away them that abound in meditations, and all they have thought upon is dissolved and brought to nought. Men meditate upon many matters, and death comes upon them suddenly, and they are led away; and thereafter they remember nothing that they have thought upon. There is one that makes plans for many years, and (the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>) is withheld from him that he shall not survive tomorrow. Some son of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is uplifted and vaunts himself over his fellow; and death comes upon him and brings to nought his vaunting. The rich man plans to add to his possessions, and he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not that he shall not continue to possess even that which he has acquired. Death leads away to himself all the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and binds them fast in his abode until the judgment. Also over those that have not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> is he king, because of the sentence of judgment that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> received for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>15. And the Life-giver shall come, the Destroyer of Death, and shall bring to nought his power, from over the just and from over the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. And the dead shall arise with a mighty shout, and Death shall be emptied and stripped of all the captivity. And for judgment shall all the children of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> be gathered together, and each shall go to the place prepared for him. The risen of the righteous shall go unto life, and the risen of the sinners shall be delivered unto death. The righteous who kept the commandment shall go, and shall not come near unto judgment in the day that they shall rise; as David asked, <em>And bring not your servant into judgment</em>;  nor will their Lord terrify them in that day.</p>

<p>16. Remember that the Apostle also said, <em>We shall judge <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371185"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:3</a></span> And our Lord said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <em>You shall sit on twelve thrones, and judge twelve tribes of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></em>.  And Ezekiel said concerning righteous men, <span class="stiki" id="note371187"><a href="../bible/eze023.htm#verse24">Ezekiel&nbsp;23:24-25</a></span> that they shall judge Ahola and Aholibah. Since, then, the righteous are to judge the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, He has made clear concerning them that they shall not come into judgment. And as to what the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> say, that <em>We shall judge <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></em>, hear, and I will instruct you. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who shall be judged by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who have violated the law; as the Prophet said, <em>The lips of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall guard <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and the law shall they inquire of his mouth; because he is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord, the most mighty</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371188"><a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse7">Malachi&nbsp;2:7</a></span> <em> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></em> who are <em>the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whose mouth the law is inquired</em>, when they transgress the law, shall be judged at the last by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who observe the law.</p>

<p>17. <em>And the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall not arise in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous</em>.  And even as the righteous who are perfected in good works shall not come into the judgment to be judged, so of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> also whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are many, and the measure of whose offenses is overflowing, it shall not be required that they should draw near unto the judgment, but when they have risen again they shall turn back to Sheol, as David said, <em>The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall turn back to Sheol, and all the nations that forget God.</em>  And Isaiah said, <em>All the nations are as a drop from the bucket, and as the turning of the balance. And the isles as a grain of sand shall be cast away, and all the nations are esteemed as nothingness by Him. For destruction and the sword are they esteemed by Him</em>.  Therefore learn and be persuaded, that all the nations that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not God their Maker, are esteemed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as nothingness, and shall not come near to judgment, but as soon as they have risen shall turn back to Sheol.</p>

<p>18. But all the rest of the world who are called sinners shall stand in the judgment and be rebuked. Those in whom there is a little shortcoming will the judge rebuke, and make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them that they have offended. And He will give them the inheritance of life after the judgment. And understand that our Lord has made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that every man according to his work shall receive his reward. He that received money, showed the increase on it. He whose pound or talent produced tenfold, received life, perfect, in nothing lacking. He whose pound or talent produced fivefold, received the half of ten. One was given a tenfold authority and one a fivefold. Now consider and see, that the increase of five is less than that of ten; and the labourers who demand the reward excel them that received it in silence. They who toiled all the day, with bold face receive the reward and demand it, in confidence that He will add more to them. While they who worked one hour receive it in silence, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> they receive mercy and life. The sinners whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are many shall be condemned by the place of judgment, and shall go into torments. And from that time and onwards, judgment shall rule over them.</p>

<p>19. Furthermore, hearken unto the Apostle who said, <em>Every man according his work shall receive his reward</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371192"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:8</a></span> He that toiled little, shall receive according to his remissness; and he that made much speed, shall be rewarded according to his speed. And Job also said, <em>Far be it from God to do iniquity; and far be it from Him to do <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For according to a man's works will He reward him, and a man shall receive according his ways.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371193"><a href="../bible/job034.htm#verse10">Job&nbsp;34:10-11</a></span> And also the Apostle said, <em>Star excels star in brightness. So also is the resurrection of the dead</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371194"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse41">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:41-42</a></span> Therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, even when men shall enter into life, yet reward shall excel reward, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall excel <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and recompense shall excel recompense. Degree is higher than degree; and light is more goodly than light in aspect. The sun excels the moon, and the moon is greater than the stars that are with her. And observe that the moon and the stars are also under the power of the sun, and their light is swallowed up in the splendour of the sun. And the sun has power along with the moon and the stars, that he may not abolish the night which has been separated from the day. And when the sun was created, he was called a luminary. And observe that the sun and the moon and the stars are all called luminaries; but luminary excels luminary. The sun obscures the light of the moon, and the moon likewise darkens the light of the stars; and star excels star in its light.</p>

<p>20. And understand (this) also, from that which is of this world, those who labour with toil, and from the hired men who work with their fellows. There are some who hire their fellow-men by day-wages, and (these) receive the wage of their toil; and there are some who are hired for the month, and compute and receive the wage for the time, at the time agreed. And the day-wage is distinguished from the monthly wage; and yearly exceeds monthly wage.</p>

<p>21. And also again, understand it from the authority that is in this world. There are some who please the king by their activity, and receive <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> from those in authority. One receives a crown from the king, to become governor in one of the countries. And under the authority of another, the king places towns; and also he excels his inferiors in his attire. Some receive presents and gifts, and one <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is distinguished from another. There is one to whom the king gives the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being steward over all the treasury. Another, according to his lower condition, serves the king, and his authority is only to provide the daily food.</p>

<p>22. Also in respect of penalty, I say that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are not equal. He that has done great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is greatly tormented. And he that has offended not so much is less tormented. Some <em>shall go into outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371195"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;7:12</a></span> Others shall be cast into the fire, according as they deserve; for it is not written that they shall gnash their teeth, nor that there is darkness there. Some shall be cast into another place, a place where <em>their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall became an astonishment to all flesh</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371196"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse24">Isaiah&nbsp;66:24</a></span> In the faces of others the door shall be closed and the Judge will say to them:&mdash; <em>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you not</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371197"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;25:12</a></span> And consider that, as the reward for good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> is not equal for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so it is also for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>. Not in one fashion shall men be judged, but every man according to his works shall receive his requital, because the Judge is clothed in righteousness and regards not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of men.</p>

<p>23. And even as I have showed you concerning the world, how one <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> excels another, of those that kings and rulers of this world give to those beneath them; also concerning this I have showed you, that even as kings have good gifts to give to those honoured by them, so also they have prisons and chains and fetters, which are various kinds of bonds. One man offends the king with a grievous offense, and without inquiry he is delivered over to death. Another offends, yet is not deserving of death; he is put in bonds until he is judged; and is chastised, and the king remits his offense. There is another whom the king has held in regard; and outside the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> house he is kept in freedom, without chains and without bonds. He that is <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> is distinguished from him that is bound; and the punishment of one exceeds that of another, according to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of his offense. But come to our Redeemer, Who said:&mdash; <em>Many are the mansions in My Father's house.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371198"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;14:2</a></span> </p>

<p>24. My beloved, men who are inferior in understanding, dispute about this that I write to you, and say:&mdash; <q>What is the place in which the righteous shall receive a good reward; and what is the place in which are torments, in which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall receive the punishments of their works?</q> O man that thinkest thus, I will ask you, and tell me, why is death called death, and why is Sheol called Sheol? For it is written that when Korah and his companions made a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <em>the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and they went down alive into Sheol</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371199"><a href="../bible/num016.htm#verse32">Numbers&nbsp;16:32-33</a></span> Therefore that was the mouth of Sheol that was opened in the wilderness. David also said, The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall turn back to Sheol.  We say that to Sheol, in which Korah and his companions were swallowed up, there shall the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> be turned back. For God has power, if He chooses, to give inheritance of life in heaven, and if it please Him, in the earth. Jesus our Lord said, <em>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371201"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;5:3</a></span> And to one of those who were crucified with Him, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on him He swore:&mdash; <em>You shall be with Me today in the garden <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371202"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;23:43</a></span> And the Apostle said, <em>When the righteous shall rise again, they shall fly upwards to meet our Redeemer</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371203"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:17</a></span> But, however, we say thus: That which our Redeemer said to us is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>:&mdash; <em><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and earth shall pass away</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371204"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;24:35</a></span> And the Apostle said, <em>Hope which is seen is not hope</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371205"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24</a></span> And the Prophet said, <em>The heavens shall pass away as smoke, and the earth as a garment shall wear away; and its inhabitants shall become like it</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371206"><a href="../bible/isa051.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;51:6</a></span> And Job said concerning those that sleep, <em>Till the heavens wear out, they shall not be aroused, nor shall they wake out of their sleep</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371207"><a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse12">Job&nbsp;14:12</a></span> From these things be persuaded that this earth, in which the children of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> are sown, and the firmament that is over men, (even) that firmament which is set to divide the upper heavens from the earth and this life, shall pass away, and wear out, and be destroyed. And God will make a new thing for the children of Adam, and they shall inherit inheritances in the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. If He shall give them inheritance in the earth, it shall be called the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. And if in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, it is easy for Him to do. For with the kings of the earth also, although each one of them abides in his own place, yet every place to which their authority extends, is called their kingdom. So the sun is a luminary set in the heaven, yet for every place to which its rays extend, its authority suffices, whether on sea or on land. And observe that the princes of the world also have banquetings and delights, and in every place or state into which they go, their banquetings are with them; and in whatever place pleases them, they make a prison-house. For the sun in twelve hours circles round, from the east unto the west; and when he has accomplished his course, his light is hidden in the night-time, and the night is not disturbed by his power. And in the hours of the night the sun turns round in his rapid course, and turning round begins to run in his accustomed path. As for the sun that is with you, you wise man, from your childhood till the completion of your old age, you know not where he runs in the night-time, so as to circle round to the place of its course. Is it necessary for you to inquire into those things that are hidden from you?</p>

<p>25. These memorials I have written for our brethren and beloved, the children of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, that when these come into their hands in various places, and when they read in them, they may also remember my insignificance in their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am a sinner also, and fall short; but that this is my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that I have set forth from the beginning and written, in these chapters written (by me). <em>Faith</em> is the foundation, and upon <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (rest) the works that become it. And after Faith (I wrote) that there are two commandments of <em>Love</em>. And after Love, I have written of <em>Fasting</em>, in its demonstration also along with its works. And after Fasting, I wrote of <em>Prayer</em> in its fruit and in its works. And after Prayer, have written about <em>War</em> and about whatever Daniel wrote concerning the kingdoms. And after War, I have written of the exhortation for <em>Monks</em>. And after the Monks, I have written about <em>Repentance</em>. And after Repentance, I have written about the <em>Resurrection of the dead</em>. And after the Resurrection of the dead, I have written about <em>Humility</em>. And after Humility, I have written of the <em>Pastors</em>, the teachers. And after the Pastors, I have written about the <em>Circumcision</em> in which the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves. And after the Circumcision, I have written about the <em><a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a></em>, and about the fourteenth day. And after the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, I have written about the <em><a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a></em>, in which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are puffed up. And after the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, I have written an  <em>Exhortation</em>, on account of the dissension which happened in our days. And after the Exhortation, I have written about <em>Meats</em>, those that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> deem unclean. And after the Meats, I have written about the <em><a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a></em>, that they have entered in and become heirs instead of the original people. And after the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, I have written and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that <em>God has a Son</em>. And after the <em><a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>, I have written against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who speak injuriously about <em>Virginity</em>. And after the apology about Virginity, I have written again <em>Against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em>, who say:&mdash; <q>It is appointed for us to be gathered together.</q> And after that defence, I have written about <em>Almsgiving to the Poor</em>. And after the Poor, I have written a demonstration about <em>The Persecuted</em>. And after the Persecuted, I have written at the end about <em>Death and the Last Times</em>. These twenty-two discourses have I written according to the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. The first ten I wrote in the six hundred and forty-eighth year of the kingdom of Alexander the son of Philip the Macedonian, as is written in the end of them. And these twelve last I wrote in the six hundred and fifty-fifth year of the kingdom of the Greeks and of the Romans, which is the kingdom of Alexander, and in the thirty-fifth year of the Persian King. </p>

<p>26. These things I have written according to what I have attained to. But if anyone shall read these discourses, and find words that do not agree with his thought, he ought not to scorn them; because whatsoever is written in these chapters was not written according to the thought of one man, nor for the persuasion of one reader; but according to the thought of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and for the persuasion of all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. If he shall read and hear with persuasion, it is well; and if not, it is meet for me to say that I wrote for those open to persuasion and not for mockers. And if again any reader should find words that are spoken by us in one fashion, and by another sage in another fashion, let him not be disturbed at this; for every man speaks to his hearers according to what he can attain to. So I, who have written these things, even if some of the words do not agree with what other speakers have said, yet say this; that those sages have spoken well, yet it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to me to speak thus. And if any man shall speak and demonstrate to me about any matter, I will receive instruction from him without contention. Everyone who reads the sacred scriptures, both former and latter, in both covenants, and reads with persuasion, will learn and teach. But if he strives about anything that he does not understand, his mind does not receive teaching. But if he finds words that are too difficult for him, and he does not understand their force, let him say thus, <q>Whatsoever is written is written well, but I have not attained to the understanding of it.</q> And if he shall ask about the matters that are too hard for him of wise and discerning men who inquire into doctrine, then, when ten wise men shall speak to him in ten different ways about one matter, let him accept that which pleases him; and if any please not him, let him not scorn the sages; for the word of God is like a pearl, that has a beautiful appearance on whatever side you turn it. And remember, O <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, what David said, <em>From all my teachers have I learned</em>.  And the Apostle said:&mdash; <em>Read every Scripture that is in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And prove everything; hold fast that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and flee from every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing</em>.  For if the days of a man should be many as all the days of the world from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to the end of the ages, and he should sit and meditate upon the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, he would not comprehend all the force of the depth of the words. And man cannot rise up to the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as I have written in the tenth discourse. But, however, the words of all speakers who do not take from the great treasure, are accursed and to be despised. For the image of the king (on his coin) is received wherever  it goes; but (the coin) in which there is base metal, is rejected and is not received. And if any one should say, <q>These discourses were spoken by such an one;</q> let him carefully learn that to be careful to inquire about the speaker is not commanded him. I also according to my insignificance have written these things, a man sprung from Adam, and fashioned by the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>. For our Lord said:&mdash; <em>Every one that asks receives, and he that seeks finds, and for him that knocks it shall be opened</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371211"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;7:8</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said:&mdash; <em>I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh in the last days, and they shall prophesy</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371212"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel&nbsp;2:28</a></span> Therefore whoever shall read anything that I have written above, let him read with persuasion, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the author as a brother of the Body; that through the petition of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>; his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be forgiven. And let whoever reads understand what is written:&mdash; <em>Let him that hears the word, communicate to him that causes him to hear, in all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371213"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;6:6</a></span> And again it is written, <em>The sower and the reaper shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> together</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371214"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;4:36</a></span> And <em>Every man according to his labours shall receive his reward</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371215"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:8</a></span> And <em>There is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed to every man</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371216"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;10:26</a></span> </p>
