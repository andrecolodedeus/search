<h1>Demonstration 8 (Of the Resurrection of the Dead)</h1>

<p>1. At all times controversies arise on this matter, <em>how the dead shall rise and with what body they shall come</em>? <span class="stiki" id="note370958"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse35">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:35</a></span> For lo! The body wears out and is corrupted; and the bones also, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, as time lengthens out over them, waste away and are not to be recognised. And when you enter a tomb in which a hundred dead men are buried, you find not there an handful of dust. And thus say those that reflect on these things:&mdash; <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of course that the dead shall rise; but they will be clothed in a heavenly body and spiritual forms. And if it is not so, these hundred dead that were buried in one tomb, of whom after a long time elapses there remains nothing at all there, when the dead shall be quickened, and shall be clothed in a body and rise, unless they shall be clothed in a heavenly body, from whence shall their body come? For lo! There is nothing in the tomb.</q></p>

<p>2. Whosoever reflects thus is foolish, and without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. When the dead were brought in, they were something; and when they were there for a long time, they became nothing. And, when the time shall have come that the dead shall rise, that nothing shall become something according to its former nature, and a change shall be added to its nature. O you unwise who reflectest thus, hear that which the blessed Apostle said when he was instructing a foolish man like you; for he said:&mdash; <em>You fool, the seed which you sow unless it die is not quickened; and that which you sow is not like that which grows up into blade, but one bare grain of wheat or barley or some other seedling. And to each one of the seeds is given its own body. But God clothes your seed with its body as He wills.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370959"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse36">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:36-38</a></span> </p>

<p>3. Therefore, O fool, be instructed by this, that each of the seeds is clothed in its own body. Never do you sow wheat and yet reap barley, and never do you plant a vine and yet it produced figs; but everything grows according to its nature. Thus also the body that was laid in the earth is that which shall rise again. And as to this, that the body is corrupted and wastes away, you ought to be instructed by the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the seed; that as the seed, when it is cast into the earth, decays and is corrupted, and from its decay it produces and buds and bears fruit. For the land that is ploughed, into which seed is not cast, produces not fruit, even if that land drinks in all the rain. So the grave in which the dead are not buried, from it men shall not issue forth in the quickening of the dead, though the full voice of the trumpet should sound within it. And if, as they say, the spirit of the just shall ascend into heaven and put on a heavenly body, they are in heaven. And He Who raises the dead dwells in heaven. Then when our Saviour shall come, whom shall He raise up from the earth? And why did He write for us:&mdash; <em>The hour shall come, and now is, that the dead also shall hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and they shall live and come forth from their tombs</em>?  For the heavenly body will not come and enter into the tomb, and again go forth from it.</p>

<p>4. For thus say those who are stubborn in folly:&mdash; Why did the Apostle say&mdash; <em>Different is the body which is in heaven from that which is on earth</em>? <span class="stiki" id="note370961"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse40">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:40</a></span> But he that hears this, let him hear also the other thing that the Apostle said:&mdash; <em>There is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370962"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse44">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:44</a></span> And again he said:&mdash; <em>We shall all sleep, but we shall not all be changed</em>.  And again he said:&mdash; <em>This that shall die must clothe itself with that that shall not die, and this which is corruptible must clothe itself with that which is incorruptible.</em>  Again he said:&mdash; <em>We must all stand before the judgment-seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that every man may be rewarded in his body for everything that before time was done by him, whether good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370965"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:10</a></span> Again he said:&mdash; <em>What shall those do that are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the dead? For if the dead rise not, why are they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for them?</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370966"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:29</a></span> Again he said:&mdash; <em>If there is no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen, and if Christ is not risen then your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is vain, and our preaching. And if so we are found false witnesses in that we testified of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He raised up Christ, Whom He raised not up</em>.  Therefore, if the dead rise not, there is no judgment. And if there is no judgment, then <em>let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die. Be not deceived; <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> communications corrupt good purposes.</em>  Now as to this that the Apostle said:&mdash; <em>The body that is in heaven is different from that which is on the earth</em>, let this word be thus understood by you. When the body of the just shall arise and be changed, it is called heavenly. And that which is not changed is called earthly, according to its earthly nature.</p>

<p>5. But hear, my beloved, another word like this, which the Apostle has spoken. For he said:&mdash; <em>The spiritual man judges everything, and he is judged by no one</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370969"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> And again he said:&mdash; <em>They that are spiritual are spiritually minded, and they that are carnal are carnally minded</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370970"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;8:5</a></span> And again he said:&mdash; <em>When we were in the flesh, the weaknesses of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were working in our members that we might become fruit for death</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370971"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;7:5</a></span> Again he said:&mdash; <em>If the Spirit of Christ is in you, you are spiritual</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370972"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;8:9</a></span> All these things the Apostle said, while he was clothed in the flesh but was doing the works of the Spirit. Thus also in the Resurrection of the dead, the righteous shall be changed, and the earthly form shall be swallowed up in the heavenly, and it shall be called a heavenly body. And that which shall not be changed, shall be called earthly.</p>

<p>6. Concerning then this Resurrection of the dead, my beloved, according to my power I will instruct you. For from the beginning God created Adam; moulded him from the dust of the earth, and raised him up. For if, while <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was not, He made him from nothing, how much easier now is it for Him to raise him up; for lo! As a seed he is sown in the earth. For if God should do those things that are easy for us, His works would not appear mighty to us. For lo! There are among men artificers who make wonderful things, and those who are not artificers of the works stand and wonder how they were done; and the work of their fellows is difficult in their eyes. How much more should not the works of God be as a marvel! But for God this was no great thing, that the dead should be quickened. Before seed was sown in the earth, the earth produced that which had not been cast into it. Before it had conceived, it bore in its <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. How then is this difficult, that the earth should <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to spring up again what had been cast into it, and after conception should bear? And lo! Her travail-pains are near; as Isaiah said, <em>Who has seen anything like this and who has heard such things as these? That the earth should travail in one day, and a people should be born in one hour</em>? <span class="stiki" id="note370973"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;66:8</a></span> For Adam unsown sprang up; unconceived he was born. But lo! now his offspring are sown, and wait for the rain, and shall spring up. And lo! The earth teems with many, and the time of her bringing forth is at hand.</p>

<p>7. For all our fathers, in hope of the Resurrection and the quickening of the dead, were looking forward and hastening; as the blessed Apostle said, <em>If the righteous had been looking forward to that city from which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> went forth, they would have had an opportunity of again turning back and to it; but they showed that they were looking forward to one better than it, namely that which is in heaven</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370974"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse15">Hebrews&nbsp;9:15-16</a></span> They were looking forward to be released and to go speedily there. And from that which I am writing unto you, understand and observe that they were looking forward to the Resurrection. For Jacob our father, when he was dying, bound Joseph his son with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and said to him, <em>Bury me in the tomb of my fathers, with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Sarah and Isaac and Rebecca.</em>  And why, my beloved, did Jacob not wish to be buried in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, but with his fathers? He showed beforehand, that he was looking forward to the quickening of the dead; that, when the Resurrection shout should be raised and the sound of the trumpet (heard), he might rise up near to his fathers, and might not at the time of the Resurrection be mingled with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> who shall return to Sheol and to punishment.</p>

<p>8. Thus also Joseph bound his brethren by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note370976"><a href="../bible/gen050.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;50:24</a></span> and said to them:&mdash; <em>When God shall remember you, take up my bones from hence with you.</em> And according to the word of Joseph his brethren did, and kept the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> a hundred and twenty-five years. At that time when the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, then <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> took up the bones of Joseph when he went forth. <span class="stiki" id="note370977"><a href="../bible/exo013.htm#verse19">Exodus&nbsp;13:19</a></span> And the bones of the righteous man were more precious and better in his estimation than the gold and the silver that the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> took from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> when they spoiled them. And the bones of Joseph were forty years in the wilderness; and at that time when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> fell asleep, he gave them in inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun. The bones of Joseph his father were better in his estimation than all the spoil of that land which he subdued. And why did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> give the bones of Joseph to Joshua? Clearly, because he was of the tribe of Ephraim the son of Joseph. And he buried them in the land of promise, that there might be in that land a treasure, (even) that of the bones of Joseph (that were) buried therein. And also at the time that Jacob was dying, he blessed his tribes, and showed them what would happen to them <em>in the latter days</em>, and said to Reuben:&mdash; <em>Reuben, you are my <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>, might and the beginning of my strength. You have gone astray; as water, you shall not abide, because you went up to your father's bed. Truly you defile my couch and went up</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370978"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;49:3-4</a></span> From the time that Jacob fell asleep until the time that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> fell asleep two hundred and thirty-three years elapsed. Then <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wished by his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power to absolve Reuben from his transgression and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in that he had lain with Bilhah, his father's concubine; that when his brethren should rise, he might not be cut off from their number. So he said in the beginning of his blessing:&mdash; <em>Reuben shall live and not die, and shall be in the number.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370979"><a href="../bible/deu033.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;33:6</a></span> </p>

<p>9. And also when the time came that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> should sleep with his fathers, he was grieved and distressed, and he sought of his Lord and entreated that he might pass over to the land of promise. And why, my beloved, was the righteous <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> grieved because he did not enter into the land of promise? Clearly, because he wished to go and be buried with his fathers, and not be buried in the land of his adversaries, in the land of Moab. For the Moabites hired Balaam the son of Beor to curse <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wished not to be buried in that land, lest the Moabites should come and take vengeance on him by taking up and casting forth the bones of that righteous man. And the Lord performed an act of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> towards <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. For He brought him forth to <a href="../cathen/10729a.htm">Mount Nebo</a>, and showed him all the land, making it pass before him. And as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> gazed upon all the land, and gazed upon the mountain of the Jebusites where the Tabernacle was to dwell, he was grieved and wept when he saw the tomb in Hebron where his fathers <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac and Jacob were buried, that he should not be buried with them, nor his bones cast upon their bones, that he might rise along with them in the Resurrection. But when he had seen all the land, his Lord encouraged him and said to him, <q>I myself will bury you and hide you, and none shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your tomb.</q> <em>So <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> died according to the word of the mouth of the Lord, and He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-Peor, where <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and no man has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his sepulchre unto this day</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370980"><a href="../bible/deu034.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy&nbsp;34:5-6</a></span> Two goodly benefits did his Lord accomplish for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in not making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his tomb to the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. He rejoiced that his adversaries should not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, and cast forth his bones from his tomb; and in the second place, that the children of his people should not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, and make his tomb a place of worship, for he was accounted as God in the eyes of the children of his people. And understand this, my beloved, from hence, that when he left them and went up to the mountain, they said: <span class="stiki" id="note370981"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;32:1</a></span> &mdash; <em>As for this <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who brought us up from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what has become of him.</em> So they made them a calf and worshipped it, and they remembered not God Who brought them up from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <em>with a mighty hand and an uplifted arm</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370982"><a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;5:15</a></span> Because of this, God had respect unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and did not make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his tomb; lest, if He should make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his tomb, the children of his people might go astray, and make them an image, and worship it and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to it, and so by their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> disquiet the bones of the righteous man.</p>

<p>10. And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> again proclaimed clearly the Resurrection of the dead, for he said as from the mouth of his God:&mdash; <em>It is I that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to die and it is I that make alive.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370983"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse39">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:39</a></span> Again also Hannah said thus in her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>:&mdash; <em>The Lord causes to die and quickens; He brings down to Sheol and brings up (therefrom).</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370984"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;2:6</a></span> The Prophet Isaiah also said thus:&mdash; <em>Your dead shall live, O Lord, and their bodies shall rise, and they that sleep in the dust shall awake and praise you.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370985"><a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;26:19</a></span> David also proclaimed, saying:&mdash; <em>For lo! For the dead You work wonderful things, and the mighty ones shall rise and make confession unto You, and those that are in the tombs shall recount Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</em>  And how <em>in the tombs</em> shall they <em>recount the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></em> of God? Clearly, when they shall hear the sound of trumpet summoning them, and the cornet sounding forth from on high, and the earthquake that shall be, and the tombs that shall be opened, then the mighty ones shall arise in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and recount one to another in the tombs, saying, <q>Great is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that is performed towards us. For our hope was cut off; yet (another) hope has arisen for us. We were imprisoned in darkness, and have come forth to the light. We were sown in corruption, and have risen in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. We were buried naturally, and we have risen spiritually. Again we were sown in weakness, and have risen in power.</q> This is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that they shall tell of in the tombs.</p>

<p>11. And it was not only in words, my beloved, that God said:&mdash; <q>I quicken the dead,</q> but also in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> He showed it to us by many testimonies; that we might have no hesitation (concerning it). He showed it beforehand plainly; for through Elijah a wonder was manifested, (in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>) that the dead shall live and that they that sleep in the dust shall arise. For when the son of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> died, Elijah raised him up and gave him to his mother. And Elisha again, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, raised up the son of the Shunamite; that the testimony of two might be established and confirmed for us. And also again when the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> cast a dead man on the bones of Elisha, that dead man revived and arose. And the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of three is certain.</p>

<p>12. And also through the Prophet Ezekiel, the Resurrection of the dead was manifestly shown, when God brought him forth to the valley and showed him many bones, and made him pass by them round about them, and said to him:&mdash; <em><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, will these bones live?</em> And Ezekiel said to Him: <span class="stiki" id="note370987"><a href="../bible/eze037.htm#verse1">Ezekiel&nbsp;37:1-10</a></span> &mdash; <em>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O Lord of lords.</em> And the Lord said to him:&mdash; <em>Prophesy, O Son Man, over these bones; prophesy and say to the dry bones, Hear the word of the Lord of lords.</em> And when he had caused them to hear those words, there was a shaking and a noise, and the bones were gathered together, even those that were crushed into pieces and broken. And when the Prophet saw them, he was astonished, for they came together from all sides, and each bone received its fellow, and each joint approached its fellow-joint, and they ordered themselves, one on another. And their dryness was made moist, and the joints were united by the ligatures, and the blood grew warm in the arteries, and skin was stretched over the flesh, and hair grew up according to its nature. But they lay prostrate and there was no breath in them. Then again He commanded the Prophet, and said to him:&mdash; <em>Prophesy unto the spirit and say to it, Come, O spirit, from the four winds, and breathe upon these slain men that they may live.</em> And when he caused them to hear this second word, <em>the spirit entered into them, and they revived and stood up upon their feet, a very great host.</em></p>

<p>13. But why, my beloved, was it that those dead did not rise because of the one word (spoken) through Ezekiel, and why was not their resurrection, both of bones and spirit, accomplished (through that one word)? For lo! By one word the bones were fitted together, and by another the spirit came. It was in order that full perfection might be left for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Who with one utterance and one word will raise up at the last day every body of man. For it was not the word that was insufficient, but its bearer was inferior. And with regard to this, understand and observe that when Elijah also, and Elisha his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, raised the dead, it was not with one word that they raised them up, but after they had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and made intercession and delayed no little time, then they arose.</p>

<p>14. And our Lord Himself, in that His first Coming raised up three that were dead, that the testimony of three might be made sure. And He raised up each one of them with two words each. For when He raised up the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> son, He called him twice, saying to him, <em>Young man, young man, arise.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370988"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;7:14</a></span> And he revived and arose. And again, He twice called the daughter of the chief of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, saying to her, <em>Damsel, damsel, arise</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370989"><a href="../bible/mar005.htm#verse47">Mark&nbsp;5:47</a></span> And her spirit returned and she arose. And after Lazarus died, when He came to the place of burial. He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> earnestly and cried with a loud voice and said, <em>Lazarus, come forth.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370990"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;11:43</a></span> And he revived and came out of his tomb.</p>

<p>15. And concerning all this that I have explained to you, that those dead <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were raised with two words each, it was because for them two resurrections take place; that former one, and the second, that which is to come. For in that resurrection in which all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall rise, none shall fall again; and by one word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sent forth through Christ, all <em>the dead shall rise in the twinkling of an eye, speedily</em>. For He Who brings it to pass is not feeble or insufficient. For with one word of summons He will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> all the ends (of the world) to hear, and all that are laid (in the grave) shall leap forth and rise up; and no word shall return void to Him that sent it forth, but as it is written in the Prophet Isaiah, <span class="stiki" id="note370991"><a href="../bible/isa055.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;55:10-11</a></span> who compares the word to rain and snow; for he said:&mdash; <em>As the rain and the snow come down from heaven and return not there, but fertilize the earth and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it to bring forth and give seed to the sower and bread for food, so shall the word be that goes forth from My mouth, and it shall not return to Me void, but shall accomplish whatsoever I desire and shall accomplish that for which I shall have sent it.</em> For the rain and the snow do not return to heaven, but accomplish in the earth the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sends them. So the word that He shall send through His Christ, Who is Himself the Word and the Message, shall return to Him with great power. For when He shall come and bring it, He shall come down like rain and snow, and through Him all that is sown shall spring up and bear righteous fruit, and the word shall return to His sender; but not in vain shall His going have been, but thus shall He say in the presence of His sender:&mdash; <em>Behold, I and the children that the Lord has given Me.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370992"><a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;8:18</a></span> And this is the voice through which the dead shall live. Concerning it our Redeemer testifies, saying:&mdash; <em>The hour shall come when even the dead shall hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and shall come forth from their tombs</em>; <span class="stiki" id="note370993"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;5:25</a></span> as it is written, <em>In the beginning was</em> the voice, that is <em>the Word</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370994"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Again He said, <em>The Word became a body and dwelt among us.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370995"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> And this is that voice of God which shall sound from on high and raise up all the dead.</p>

<p>16. Again, our Lord explained to the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> with regard to the resurrection of the dead, when they brought forth to Him the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was married to seven husbands, and said to Him:&mdash; <em>Lo! The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was wife of them all; in the Resurrection of the dead, to which of them shall she be wife?</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370996"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;22:28</a></span> Then our Lord said to them:&mdash; <em>You do greatly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> nor the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For they who are worthy of that world and of that Resurrection from the dead, they that are men do not take wives, nor are the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> married to husbands, for they cannot die, for they are as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and children of the Resurrection. But concerning the Resurrection, that the dead shall rise, have you not read in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> that God said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> out of the bush, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, of Isaac and of Jacob.</q> And lo! He is not God of the dead, for they all are alive unto Him.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370997"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;23:29-32</a></span> </p>

<p>17. And there are those who even while they live are dead unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For He laid a commandment on <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and said to him, <em>In the day that you shall eat of the tree, you shall surely die</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370998"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;2:17</a></span> And after he had transgressed the commandment, and had eaten, he lived nine hundred and thirty years; but he was accounted dead unto God because of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But that it may be made certain for you that a sinner is called dead even when he lives, I will make it clear to you. For thus it is written in Ezekiel the Prophet, <em>As I live, says the Lord of lords, I desire not the death of the dead sinner.</em> </p>

<p>18. Moreover our Lord said to that man who said to Him:&mdash; <em>Let me go and bury my father, and I will come to You</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371000"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse59">Luke&nbsp;9:59-60</a></span> And our Lord said to him, <em>Let the dead bury their dead, but go, preach the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>.</em> But how is this word understood by you, my beloved? Did you ever see the dead burying their dead? Or how shall a dead man arise to bury another dead man? But receive this explanation from me, that a sinner, while he is living, is dead unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and a righteous man, though dead, is alive unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For such death is a sleep, as David said, <em>I lay down and slept, and awoke</em>.  Again Isaiah said, <em>They that sleep in the dust shall awake</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371002"><a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;26:19</a></span> And our Lord said concerning the daughter of the chief of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, <em>The damsel is not dead, but sleeping a slumber</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371003"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;9:26</a></span> And concerning Lazarus, He said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>:&mdash; <em>Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go to waken him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371004"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;11:11</a></span> And the Apostle said:&mdash; <em>We shall all sleep, but we shall not all be changed</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371005"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse51">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:51</a></span> And again he said:&mdash; <em>Concerning those that sleep, be not grieved.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note371006"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> </p>

<p>19. But it is right for us to be afraid of the second death,  that which is full of weeping and gnashing of teeth, and of groanings and miseries, that which is situated in outer darkness. But blessed shall be the faithful and the righteous in that Resurrection, in which they expect to be awakened and to receive the good promises made them. But as for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> who are not faithful, in the Resurrection woe to them, because of that which is laid up for them! It would be better for them according to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they possess, were they not to arise. For the servant, for whom his Lord is preparing stripes and bonds, while he is sleeping desires not to awake, for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that when the dawn shall have come and he shall awake, his Lord will scourge and bind him. But the good servant, to whom his Lord has promised gifts, looks expectantly for the time when dawn shall come and he shall receive presents from his Lord. And even though he is soundly sleeping, in his dream he sees something like what his Lord is about to give him, whatsoever He has promised him, and he rejoices in his dream, and exults, and is gladdened. As for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, his sleep is not pleasant to him, for he imagines that lo! The dawn has come for him, and his heart is broken in his dream. But the righteous sleep, and their slumber is pleasant to them, in the day-time and the night-time, and they take no thought of all that long night, and like one hour is it accounted in their eyes. Then in the watch of the dawn they awake with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. But as for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, their sleep lies heavy upon them, and they are like a man who is laid low by a great and deep fever, and tosses on his couch hither and there, and he is terrified the whole night long, which lengthens itself out for him, and he fears the dawn when his Lord will condemn him.</p>

<p>20. But our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> thus teaches, that when men fall asleep, they sleep this slumber without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> good from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And the righteous look not forward to their promises, nor do the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> look forward to their sentence of punishment, until the Judge come and separate those whose place is at His right hand from those whose place is at His left. And be instructed by that which is written, that when the Judge shall sit, and the books be opened before Him and the good and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> recited, then they that have wrought good works shall receive good rewards from Him Who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and they that have done <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> shall receive <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> penalties from the just Judge. For towards the good, He changes not His nature; and He proves Himself just because He <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemns many. But towards the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> He changes His nature, in that world where <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is lost in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and He proves Himself just to all. And <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> will not be joined with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> towards them. Like as <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> avails not (to remedy) detriment, so <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (avails not to assist) <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is far from the judge, but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> urges the judge. If <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be near to any one, let him turn himself towards it, and not deliver himself into the hands of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, lest it condemn him, exacting for his shortcomings the penalty at his hands. And if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be far from any one, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> will bring him to the trial, and by it he will be condemned, and go away to the torment.</p>

<p>21. But hear, my beloved, this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that retribution shall take place at the end. For when the Shepherd divides His flock and sets some on His right hand and some on His left,  until He shall have acknowledged the service of the good, then He will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to inherit the kingdom; and until He shall have rebuked the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and they are condemned, then He will send them to the torment. And as to them that sent messengers after the King, saying, <em>This man shall not be king over us</em>,  when He shall receive the kingdom and return, then His adversaries shall be slain before Him. And the labourers who hastened and were wearied in the vineyard, shall not receive the reward till the labour shall cease. And the traders who received the money, when the Lord of the money shall come, then shall He exact the <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who, while waiting for the bridegroom, slumbered and slept because He delayed to come, when they shall hear the cry, then they shall awake and trim their lamps; and they that are wise shall enter in; and the foolish shall be shut out. And they who were before us in entering the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, without us <em>shall not be made perfect</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371010"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse40">Hebrews&nbsp;11:40</a></span> </p>

<p>22. From all these things, understand, my beloved, as it has been made certain for you, that as yet no one has received his reward. For the righteous have not inherited the kingdom, nor have the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> gone into torment. The Shepherd has not as yet divided His flock. And lo! The workmen enter into the vineyard, and as yet have not received the reward. And lo! The merchants are trading with the money. And as yet their Lord has not come to take the account. And the King has gone to receive the Kingdom, but as yet He has not returned the second time. And those <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> that are waiting the bridegroom are sleeping up to the present time, and are awaiting the cry when they will awake. And the former men who toiled in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> until the last men shall come, shall not be made perfect.</p>

<p>23. But they who are babes in understanding say:&mdash; <q>If no one has received his reward, why did the Apostle say, <em>When we shall depart from the body, we shall be present with the Lord?</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note371011"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> But recollect, my beloved, that I instructed you concerning this matter in the <em>Demonstration concerning Solitaries</em>,  that the spirit which the righteous receive, according to its heavenly nature, goes to our Lord until the time of the Resurrection, when it shall come to put on the body in which it dwelt. And at every time it has the memory of this in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and looks eagerly for the Resurrection of that body in which it dwelt, as the Prophet Isaiah said about the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>:&mdash; <em>They that make mention of you shall be faithful and stand before the Lord, and you shall not give them rest</em>.  But as to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, they have none to make mention of them before the Lord, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is far removed from them, because they are animal, and are buried after the manner of animals.</p>

<p>24. And again, (the followers of) doctrines, which are instruments of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>, are offended by the word which our Lord spoke, <em>No one has ascended up to heaven but He Who came down from heaven, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, Who was in heaven</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371014"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;3:13</a></span> And they say, <q>Lo! Our Lord testified that no earthly body has ascended to heaven.</q> In their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> they cannot apprehend the force of this. For when our Lord instructed <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, he did not apprehend the force of the saying. Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said to him:&mdash; <em>No one has ascended into heaven, so as to come down and</em> relate to you whatsoever is there. For <em>if I have spoken unto you of those things that are in the earth, and you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, how shall you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> if I shall speak unto you of those things which are in heaven</em>? <span class="stiki" id="note371015"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;3:12</a></span> For lo! no other <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> besides Me has come down from thence, to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> concerning those things which are in heaven, so that you should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For Elijah went up there, but he came not down along with Me to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that the testimony of two might be sure.</p>

<p>25. But as for you, my beloved, have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the Resurrection of the dead. For the living mouth (of God) testifies:&mdash; <em>I <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to die and I make alive</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note371016"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse39">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:39</a></span> And both of them proceeded out of one mouth. And as we are sure that He causes to die, and we see it; so also it is sure and worthy of belief, that He makes alive. And from all that I have explained to you, receive and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that in the day of the Resurrection your body shall arise in its entirety, and you shall receive from our Lord the reward of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and in all that you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, you shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and be made glad.</p>
