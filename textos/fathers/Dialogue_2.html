<h1>Dialogue 2</h1>

<p><strong>Eranistes and Orthodoxus.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I have come as I promised. 'Tis yours to adopt one of two alternatives, and either furnish a solution of my difficulties, or assent to what I and my friends lay down.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I accept your challenge, for I think it right and fair. But we must first recall to mind at what point we left off our discourse yesterday, and what was the conclusion of our argument.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I will remind you of the end. I remember our agreeing that the divine Word remained immutable, and took flesh, and was not himself changed into flesh.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; You seem to be content with the points agreed on, for you have faithfully called them to mind.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes, and I have already said that the man that withstands teachers so many and so great is indubitably out of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. I was moreover put to not a little shame to find that <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> used the same terms as the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, although in his books about the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> his drift has distinctly been in another direction.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then we affirm that the Divine Word took flesh?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; We do.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And what do we mean by the flesh? A body only, as is the view of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius, or body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; What kind of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? The reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or that which is by some termed the <em>phytic</em>, vegetable,  that is, vital? For the fable-mongering quackery of the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarians</a> compels us to ask unseemly questions.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Does then <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> make a distinction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>? </p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; He says that man is composed of three parts, of a body, a vital <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and further of a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which he terms mind. <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> on the contrary <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only one, not two <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; and this is plainly taught us by the formation of the first man. For it is written God took dust from the earth and <q>formed man,</q> and <q>breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  And in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a> the Lord said to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <q>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but rather <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> him which is able to destroy both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q> </p>

<p>And the very divine <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> when he told the tale of them that came down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and stated with whom each tribal chief had come in, added, <q>All the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were seventy-five,</q>  reckoning one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for each immigrant. And the divine apostle at <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>, when all supposed Eutychus to be dead, said <q>Trouble not yourselves for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in him.</q> </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; It is shown clearly that each man has one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> says two; and that the Divine Word took the unreasonable, and that instead of the reasonable, he was made in the flesh. It was on this account that I asked what kind of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> you assert to have been assumed with the body.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I say the reasonable. For I follow the Divine Scripture.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; We agree then that the <q>form of a servant</q> assumed by the Divine Word was complete.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes; complete.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And rightly; for since the whole first man became subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and lost the impression of the Divine Image,  and the race followed, it results that the Creator, with the intention of renewing the blurred image, assumed the nature in its entirety, and stamped an imprint far better than the first.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; True. But now I beg you in the first place that the meaning of the terms employed may be made quite clear, that thus our discussion may advance without hindrance, and no investigation of doubtful points intervene to interrupt our conversation.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; What you say is admirable. Ask now concerning whatever point you like.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; What must we call Jesus the Christ? Man?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; By neither name alone, but by both. For the Divine Man after being made man was named <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. <q>For,</q> it is written, <q>You shall call His name Jesus for he shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q>  and unto you is born this day in the city of David Christ the Lord.  Now these are <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels'</a> voices. But before the Incarnation he was named <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, only begotten, Lord, Divine Word, and Creator. For it is written <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  and <q>all things were made by Him,</q>  and <q>He was life,</q>  and <q>He was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light which lights every man that comes into the world.</q> There are also other similar passages, declaring the divine nature. But after the Incarnation He was named Jesus and Christ.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Therefore the Lord Jesus is God only.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; You hear that the divine Word was made man, and do you call him God only?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Since He became man without being changed, but remained just what He was before, we must call Him just what He was.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The divine Word was and is and will be immutable. But when He had taken man's nature He became man. It behooves us therefore to confess both natures, both that which took, and that which was taken.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; We must name Him by the nobler.</p>

<p> <em>Orth</em>&mdash; Man&mdash;I mean man the animal&mdash;is he a simple or a composite being?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Composite.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Composed of what component parts?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Of a body and a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And of these natures whether is nobler?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Clearly the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for it is reasonable and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and has been entrusted with the sovereignty of the animal. But the body is mortal and perishable, and without the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is unreasonable, and a corpse.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> ought to have called the animal after its more excellent part.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; It does so call it, for it calls them that came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For with seventy-five <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, it says, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> came down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But does the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> never call any one after the body?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; It calls them that are the slaves of flesh, flesh. For <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> it is written, <q>said my spirit shall not always remain in these men, for they are flesh.</q> </p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But without blame no one is called flesh?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I do not remember.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then I will remind you, and point out to you that even the very <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are called <q>flesh.</q> Answer now. What would you call the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? Spiritual, or fleshly?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Spiritual&mdash;and leaders and teachers of the spiritual.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Hear now the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when he says <q>But when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood neither went I up to them that were <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> before me.</q>  Does he so style the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> because he blames them?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Certainly not.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Is it not that he names them after their visible nature, and comparing the calling which is of men with that which is of heaven?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; True.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then hear too the psalmist David&mdash; <q>Unto you shall all flesh come.</q>  Hear too, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah foretelling <q>All flesh shall see the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of our God.</q> </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; It is made perfectly plain that <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> names <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from the flesh without the least blame.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I will proceed to give you the yet further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; What further?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The fact that sometimes when giving blame the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> uses only the name of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; And where will you find this in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Hear the Lord God speaking through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ezekiel <q>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> it shall die.</q>  Moreover through the great <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> He says <q>If a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash; </q>  And again <q>It shall come to pass that every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that will not hear that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> shall be cut off.</q>  And many other passages of the same kind may be found.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; This is plainly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; In cases, then, where there is a certain natural union, and a combination of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, and of beings connected by service and by time, it is not the custom of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture to use a name for this being derived only from the nobler nature; it names it indiscriminately both by the meaner and by the nobler. If so, how can you find fault with us for calling Christ the Lord, man, after confessing Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when many things combine to compel us to do so?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; What is there to compel us to call the Saviour Christ, <q>man</q>?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The diverse and mutually inconsistent opinions of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; What opinions, and contrary to what?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; That of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> to that of Sabellius. The one divides the substances: the other confounds the hypostases. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> introduces three substances, and Sabellius makes one hypostasis instead of three.  Tell me now, how ought we to heal both maladies? Must we apply the same drug for both ailments, or for each the proper one?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; For each the proper one.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; We shall therefore endeavour to persuade <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> to acknowledge the substance of the Holy Trinity, and we shall adduce <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of this position from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes: this ought to be done.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But in arguing with Sabellius we shall adopt the opposite course. Concerning the substance we shall advance no argument, for even he acknowledges but one.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Plainly.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But we shall do our best to cure the unsound part of his doctrine.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; We say that where he halts is about the hypostases.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Since then he asserts there to be one hypostasis of the Trinity, we shall point out to him that the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> proclaims three hypostases.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; This is the course to take. But we have wandered from the subject.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Not at all. We are collecting <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of it, as you will learn in a moment. But tell me, do you understand that all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which derive their name from Christ, acknowledge both the Godhead of Christ and His manhood?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; By no means.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Do not some acknowledge the godhead alone, and some the manhood alone?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And some but a part of the manhood?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I think so. But it will be well for us to lay down the names of the holders of these different opinions, that the point under discussion may be made plainer.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I will tell you the names. Simon, Menander, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a>, Cerdo, and Manes, openly denied the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. On the other hand Artemon, Theodotus, Sabellius, <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>, Marcellus, and Photinus, fell into the diametrically opposite <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; for they preach Christ to be man only, and deny the Godhead which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the ages. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius make the Godhead of the only begotten a created Godhead, and maintain that He assumed only a body. <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> confesses that the assumed body was a living  body, but in his work deprives the reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alike of its <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and of its <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. This is the contrariety of these corrupt opinions. But do you, with all due <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, tell us, must we institute a discussion with these men, or shall we let them go dashed down headlong and howling to their doom?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; It is inhuman to neglect the sick.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Very well; then we must compassionate them, and do our best to heal them.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; By all means.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; If then you had scientifically learned how to cure the body, and round you stood many men asking you to cure them, and showing their various ailments, such as arise from running at the eyes, injury to the ears, tooth-ache, contraction of the joints, palsy, bile, or phlegm, what would you have done? Tell me; would you have applied the same treatment to all, or to each that which was appropriate?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I should certainly have given to each the appropriate remedy.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; So by applying cold treatment to the hot, and heating the cold, and loosing the strained, and giving tension to the loose, and drying the moist, and moistening the dry, you would have driven out the diseases and restored the health which they had expelled.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; This is the treatment prescribed by medical science, for contraries, it is said, are the remedies of contraries.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; If you were a gardener, would you give the same treatment to all plants? Or their own to the mulberry and the fig, and so to the pear, to the apple, and to the vine what is fitting to each, and in a word to each plant its own proper culture?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; It is obvious that each plant requires its own treatment.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And if you undertook to be a ship builder, and saw that the mast wanted repair, would you try to mend it in the same way as you would the tiller? Or would you give it the proper treatment of a mast?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; There is no question about these things: everything demands its own treatment, be it plant or limb or gear or tackle.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then is it not monstrous to apply to the body and to things without life to each its own appropriate treatment, and not to keep this rule of treatment in the case of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Most <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>; nay, rather stupid than unrighteous. They who adopt any other method are quite unskilled in the healing art.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then in disputing against each <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> we shall use the appropriate remedy?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; By all means.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And it is fitting treatment to add what is wanting and to remove what is superfluous?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; In endeavouring then to cure Photinus and Marcellus and their adherents, in order to carry out the rule of treatment, what should we add?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; The acknowledgment of the Godhead of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for it is this that they lack.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But about the manhood we will say nothing to them, for they acknowledge the Lord Christ to be man.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You are right.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And in arguing with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius about the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the only begotten, what should we persuade them to add to their own confession?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; The assumption of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for they say that the divine Word took only a body.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And what does <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> lack to make his teaching accurate about the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Not to separate the mind from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but to confess that, with the body, was assumed a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then shall we dispute with him on this point?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Certainly.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But under this head what did we assert to be confessed, and what altogether denied, by <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, Manes and their adherents?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; That they admitted their belief in the Godhead of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but do not accept the doctrine of His manhood.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; We shall therefore do our best to persuade them to accept also the doctrine of the manhood, and not to call the divine <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>  a mere appearance.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; It will be well so to do.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; We will therefore tell them that it is right to style the Christ not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also man.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; By all means.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And how is it possible for us to induce others to style the Christ 'man' while we excuse ourselves from doing so? They will not yield to our persuasion, but on the contrary will convict us of agreeing with them.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; And how can we, confessing as we do that the divine Word took flesh and a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, agree with them?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; If we confess the fact, why then shun the word?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; It is right to name the Christ from His nobler qualities.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Keep this rule then. Do not speak of Him as crucified, nor yet as risen from the dead, and so on.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; But these are the names of the sufferings of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Denial of the sufferings implies denial of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And the name Man is the name of a nature. Not to pronounce the name is to deny the nature: denial of the nature is denial of the sufferings, and denial of the sufferings does away with the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I hold it profitable to acknowledge the assumed nature; but to style the Saviour of the world man is to belittle the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Do you then deem yourself wiser than Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; aye, and than the Saviour Himself? For the Lord said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <q>Why do you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which I heard of my Father?</q>  And He frequently called Himself <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>.</p>

<p>And the meritorious Peter, in his sermon to the Jewish people, says&mdash;<q>You men of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, hear these words. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, a man approved of God among you.</q>  And the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, when bringing the message of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the chiefs of the Areopagus, among many other things said this&mdash;</p>

<p><q>And the times of this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> God winked at; but now commands all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> everywhere to repent: Because he has appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained, whereof he has given assurance unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in that he has raised him from the dead.</q>  He then who excuses himself from using the name appointed and preached by the Lord and his Apostles deems himself wiser than even these great instructors, aye, even than the very well-spring of the wisest.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; They gave this instruction to the unbelievers. Now the greater part of the world  has professed the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But we have still among us <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> systems innumerable, and to each of these we must give fit and appropriate teaching. But, supposing we were all of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, tell me now, what harm is there in calling the Christ both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>? Do we not behold in Him perfect Godhead, and manhood likewise lacking in nothing?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; This we have owned again and again.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Why then deny what we have again and again owned?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I hold it unnecessary to call the Christ 'man,'&mdash; especially when believer is conversing with believer.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Do you consider the divine Apostle a believer?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes: a teacher of all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And do you deem Timothy worthy of being so styled?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes: both as a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Apostle, and as a teacher of the rest.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Very well: then hear the teacher of teachers writing to his very perfect <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. <q>There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, and one mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all.</q>  Do stop your idle prating, and laying down the law about divine names. Moreover in this passage that very name 'mediator' stands indicative both of Godhead and of manhood. He is called a mediator because He does not exist as God alone; for how, if He had had nothing of our nature could He have mediated between us and God? But since as God He is joined with God as having the same substance, and as man with us, because from us He took the form of a servant, He is properly termed a mediator, uniting in Himself distinct qualities by the unity of natures of Godhead, I mean, and of manhood. </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; But was not <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> called a mediator, though only a man? </p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; He was a type of the reality: but the type has not all the qualities of the reality. Wherefore though <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was not by nature <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet, to fulfil the type, he was called a god. For He says <q>See, I have made you a god to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>.</q>  And then directly afterwards he assigns him also a Prophet as though to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for <q><a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> your brother,</q> He says, <q>shall be your Prophet.</q>  But the reality is by nature <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by nature man.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; But who would call one not having the distinct characteristics of the archetype, a type?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The imperial images, it seems, you do not call images of the emperor.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes, I do.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yet they have not all the characteristics which their archetype has. For in the first place they have neither life nor reason; secondly they have no inner organs, heart, I mean, and belly and liver and the adjacent parts. Further they present the appearance of the organs of sense, but perform none of their functions, for they neither hear, nor speak, nor see; they cannot write; they cannot walk, nor perform any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action; and yet they are called imperial <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>. In this sense <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was a mediator and Christ was a mediator; but the former as an image and type and the latter as reality. But that I may make this point clearer to you from yet another authority, call to mind the words used of Melchisedec in the Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; What words?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Those in which the divine Apostle comparing the Levitical <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> with that of the Christ likens Melchisedec in other respects to the Lord Christ, and says that the Lord had the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> after the order of Melchisedec. </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I think the words of the divine Apostle are as follows&mdash;<q>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the most high God who met <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; to whom also <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation king of righteousness, and after that also king of Salem, which is king of peace; without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>; abides a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> continually.</q>  I presume you spoke of this passage.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yes, I spoke of this; and I must praise you for not mutilating it, but for quoting the whole. Tell me now, does each one of these points fit Melchisedec in nature and reality?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Who has the audacity to deny a fitness where the divine apostle has asserted it?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then you say that all this fits Melchisedec by nature?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Do you say that he was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or assumed some other nature?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; A man.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Begotten or unbegotten?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You are asking very absurd questions.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The fault lies with you for openly opposing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Answer then.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; There is one only unbegotten, who is God and Father.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then we assert that Melchisedec was begotten?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But the passage about him teaches the opposite. Remember the words which you quoted a moment ago, <q>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life.</q> How then do the words <q>Without father and without mother</q> fit him; and how the statement that he neither received beginning of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> nor end, since all this transcends humanity?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; These things do in fact overstep the limits of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then shall we say that the Apostle told lies?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; God forbid.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; How then is it possible both to testify to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Apostle, and apply the supernatural to Melchisedec?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; The passage is a very difficult one, and requires much explanation.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; For any one willing to consider it with attention it will not be hard to attain perception of the meaning of the words. After saying <q>without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life,</q> the divine Apostle adds <q>made like the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, abides a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> continually.</q>  Here he plainly teaches us that the Lord Christ is archetype of Melchisedec in things concerning the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And he speaks of Melchisedec as <q>made like the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> Now let us examine the point in this manner&mdash;do you say that the Lord had a father according to the flesh?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Certainly not.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Why?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; He was born of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin alone.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; He is therefore properly styled <q>without father</q>?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; True.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Do you say that according to the divine Nature He had a mother? </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Certainly not.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; For He was begotten of the Father alone before the ages?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Agreed.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And yet, as the generation He has of the Father is ineffable, He is spoken of as <q>without descent.</q> <q>Who</q> says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <q>shall declare His generation?</q> </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You are right.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Thus it becomes Him to have neither beginning of days nor end of life; for He is without beginning, indestructible, and, in a word, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and coeternal with the Father.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; This is my view too. But we must now consider how this fits the admirable Melchisedec.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; As an image and type. The image, as we have just observed, has not all the properties of the archetype. Thus to the Saviour these qualities are proper both by nature and in reality; but the story of the origin of the race has attributed them to Melchisedec. For after telling us of the father of the patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and of the father and mother of Isaac, and in like manner of Jacob and of his sons, and exhibiting the pedigree of our first forefathers, of Melchisedec it records neither the father nor the mother, nor does it teach that he traced his descent from any one of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a> sons, to the end that he may be a type of Him who is in reality without father, and without mother. And this is what the divine Apostle would have us understand, for in this very passage he says further, <q>But he whose descent is not counted from them received <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and blessed him that had the promises.</q> </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Then, since <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> has not mentioned his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, can he be called without father and without mother?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; If he had really been without father and without mother, he would not have been an image, but a reality. But since these are his qualities not by nature, but according to the dispensation of the Divine Scripture, he exhibits the type of the reality.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; The type must have the character of the archetype.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Is man called an image of God?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Man is not an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but was made in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Listen then to the Apostle. He says: <q>For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Granted, then, that he is an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; According to your argument then he must needs have plainly preserved the characters of the archetype, and have been uncreate, uncompounded, and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. He ought in like manner to have been able to create out of the non existent, he ought to have fashioned all things by his word and without labour, in addition to this to have been free from sickness, sorrow, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to have been <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and incorruptible and to possess all the qualities of the archetype.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Man is not an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in every respect.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Though <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> an image in the qualities in which you would grant him to be so, you will find that he is separated by a wide interval from the reality.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Agreed.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Consider now too this point. The divine Apostle calls the Son the image of the Father; for he says <q>Who is the image of the invisible God?</q> </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; What then; has not the Son all the qualities of the Father?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; He is not Father. He is not uncaused. He is not unbegotten.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; If He were He would not be Son.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then does not what I said hold good; the image has not all the qualities of the archetype?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; True.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Thus too the divine Apostle said that Melchisedec is made like the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Suppose we grant that he is without Father and without Mother and without descent, as you have said. But how are we to understand his having neither beginning of days nor end of life?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> when writing the ancient genealogy tells us how <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> being so many years old begot Seth,  and when he had lived so many years he ended his life.  So too he writes of Seth, of <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, and of the rest, but of Melchisedec he mentions neither beginning of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> nor end of life. Thus as far as the story goes he has neither beginning of days nor end of life, but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and reality the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> never began to exist and shall never have an end.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Agreed.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then, so far as what belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and is really divine is concerned, Melchisedec is a type of the Lord Christ; but as far as the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is concerned, which belongs rather to man than to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Lord Christ was made a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> after the order of Melchisedec.  For Melchisedec was a <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of the people, and the Lord Christ for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> has made the right <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> offering of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; We have spent many words on this matter.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yet more were needed, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, for you said the point was a difficult one.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Let us return to the question before us.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; What was the question?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; On my remarking that Christ must not be called man, but only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you yourself besides many other testimonies adduced also the well known words of the Apostle which he has used in his epistle Timothy&mdash; <q>One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one mediator between God and men, the man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time.</q> </p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I remember from what point we diverged into this digression. It was when I had said that the name of mediator exhibits the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and you said that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was called a mediator though he was only a man and not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. I was therefore under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of following up these points to show that the type has not all the qualities of the archetype. Tell me, then, whether you allow that the Saviour ought also to be called man.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I call Him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He is God's Son.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; If you call him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because you have learned that he is God's Son, call him also man, for he often called Himself <q><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>.</q></p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; The name man does not apply to Him in the same way as the name God.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; As not really belonging to Him or for some other reason?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; God is his name by nature; man is the designation of the Incarnation. </p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But are we to look on the Incarnation as real, or as something imaginary and false?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; As real.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; If then the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Incarnation is real, and what we call Incarnation is the divine Word's being made man, then the name man is real; for after taking man's nature He is called man.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Before His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> He was styled man, but afterward He was no longer so styled.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But it was after the Passion and the Resurrection that the divine Apostle wrote the Epistle to Timothy wherein he speaks of the Saviour Christ as man,  and writing after the Passion and the Resurrection to the Corinthians he exclaims <q>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</q>  And in order to make his meaning clear he adds, <q>For as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</q>  And after the Passion and the Resurrection the divine Peter, in his address to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, called Him man.  And after His being taken up into heaven, Stephen the victorious, amid the storm of stones, said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> standing on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Are we to suppose ourselves wiser than the illustrious heralds of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I do not suppose myself wiser than the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> doctors, but I fail to find the use of the name.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; How then could you persuade them that deny the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionists</a>, I mean, and Manichees, and all the rest who are thus unsound, to accept the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, unless you adduce these and similar <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> with the object of showing that the Lord Christ is not God only but also man?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Perhaps it is necessary to adduce them.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Why not then teach the faithful the reality of the doctrine? Are you forgetful of the apostolic precept enjoining us to be <q>ready to give an answer.</q>  Now let us look at the matter in this light. Does the best general engage the enemy, attack with arrows and javelins, and endeavour to break their column all alone, or does he also arm his men, and marshal them, and rouse their hearts to play the man?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; He ought rather to do this latter.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yes; for it is not the part of a general to expose his own life, and take his place in the ranks, and let his men go fast asleep, but rather to keep them awake for their work at their post.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; True.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; This is what the divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> did, for in writing to them who had made profession of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he said, <q>Take unto you the whole armour of God that you be able to stand against the wiles of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>.</q>  And again, <q>Stand therefore with your loins girt about with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q>  and so on. Bear in mind too what we have already said, that a physician supplies what nature lacks. Does he find the cold redundant? He supplies the hot, and so on with the rest; and this is what the Lord does.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; And where will you show that the Lord has done this?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; In the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Show me then and fulfil your promise.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; What did the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> consider our Saviour Christ?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; A man.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And that He was also God they were wholly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Was it not then necessary for the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> to learn?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Agreed.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Listen to Him then saying to them: <q>Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?</q>  And when they replied: <q>For a good work we stone you not, but for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and because that thou being a man makest yourself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  He added <q>It is written in your law I said you are gods. If he called them gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken, say ye of Him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world you blaspheme, because I said I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? If I do not the works of my father <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me not...that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.</q> </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; In the passages you have just read you have shown that the Lord showed Himself to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to be God and not man.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yes, for they did not need to learn what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>; that He was a man they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, but they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He was from the beginning God. He adopted this same course in the case of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>; for when He saw them accosting Him as a mere man He asked them <q>What do you think of Christ? Whose son is He?</q>  And when they said <q>Of David</q> He went on <q>How then does David calling him Lord say 'The Lord said unto my Lord sit on my right hand.'</q>  Then He goes on to argue, <q>If then He is His Lord how is He His Son?</q></p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You have brought testimony against yourself, for the Lord plainly taught the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> to call Him not <q>Son of David</q> but <q>Lord of David.</q> Wherefore He is distinctly shown wishing to be called God and not man.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I am afraid you have not attended to the divine teaching. He did not repudiate the name of <q>Son of David,</q> but He added that He ought also to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be Lord of David. This He clearly shows in the words <q>If He is his Lord how is He then his Son?</q> He did not say <q>if He is Lord He is not Son,</q> but <q>how is He his Son?</q> instead of saying in one respect He is Lord and in another Son. These passages both distinctly show the Godhead and the manhood.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; There is no need of argument. The Lord distinctly teaches that He does not wish to be called Son of David.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then He ought to have told the blind men and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Canaan and the multitude not to call Him Son of David, and yet the blind men cried out <q>You Son of David have mercy on us.</q>  And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Canaan <q>Have mercy on me O Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a Devil.</q>  And the multitude: <q><a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the Son of David! Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord.</q>  And not only did He not take it ill, but even praised their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for the blind He freed from their long weary night and granted them the power of sight; the maddened and distraught daughter of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Canaan He healed and drove out the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>; and when the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> were offended at them that shouted <q><a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the Son of David</q> He did not merely not prevent them from shouting, but even sanctioned their acclamation, for, said He, <q>I tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out.</q> </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; He put up with this style of address before the resurrection in condescension to the weakness of them that had not yet properly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. But after the resurrection these names are needless.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Where shall we rank the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>? Among the perfect or the imperfect?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; It is wrong to joke about serious things.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; It is wrong to make light of the reading of the divine oracles.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; And who is such a wretch as to despise his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Answer my question, and then you will learn your <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; What question?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Where are we to rank the divine Apostle?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Plainly among the most perfect, and one of the perfect teachers.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And when did he begin his teaching?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; After the ascension of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a> of the victorious Stephen.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, at the very end of his life, when writing his last letter to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> Timothy, and in giving him, as it were, his paternal inheritance by will, added <q>Remember that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was raised from the dead according to my gospel.</q>  Then he went on to mention his sufferings on behalf of the gospel, and thus showed its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> saying, <q>Wherein I suffer trouble as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doer even unto bonds.</q> </p>

<p>It were easy for me to adduce many similar testimonies, but I have judged it needless to do so.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You promised to prove that the Lord supplied the lacking instruction to them that needed, and you have shown that He discoursed about His own Godhead to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, and to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But that He gave also His instruction about the flesh you have not shown.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; It would have been quite superfluous to have discoursed about the flesh which was before their eyes, for He was plainly seen eating and drinking and toiling and sleeping. Furthermore, to omit the many and various events before the passion, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to His disbelieving <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> not His Godhead but His manhood; for He said, <q>Behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself. Handle me and see for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see me have.</q> </p>

<p>Now I have fulfilled my promise, for we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the giving of instruction about the Godhead to them that were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Godhead, and about the resurrection of the flesh to them that denied this latter. Cease therefore from contending, and confess the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of the Saviour.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; There were two before the union, but, after combining, they made one nature.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; When do you say that the union was effected?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I say at the exact moment of the conception.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And do you deny that the divine Word <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the conception?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I say that He was before the ages.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And that the flesh was co-existent with Him?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; By no means.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But was formed, after the salutation of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; So I say.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Therefore before the union there were not two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> but only one. For if the Godhead pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, but the manhood was not co-existent, being formed after the angelic salutation, and the union being coincident with the formation, then before the union there was one nature, that which exists always and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the ages. Now let us again consider this point. Do you understand the making of flesh or becoming man to be anything other than the union?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; No.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; For when He took flesh He was made flesh.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Plainly.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And the union coincides with the taking flesh.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; So I say.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; So before the making man there was one nature. For if both union and making man are identical, and He was made man by taking man's nature, and the form of God took the form of a servant, then before the union the divine nature was one.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; And how are the union and the making man identical?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; A moment ago you confessed that there is no distinction between these terms.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You led me astray by your arguments.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then, if you like, let us go over the same ground again.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; We had better so do.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Is there a distinction between the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> and the union, according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the transaction?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Certainly; a very great distinction.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Explain fully the character of this distinction.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Even the sense of the terms shows the distinction, for the word <q><a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a></q> shows the taking of the flesh, while the word <q>union</q> indicates the combination of distinct things.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Do you represent the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> to be anterior to the union?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; By no means.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; You say that the union took place in the conception?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I do.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Therefore if not even the least moment of time intervened between the taking of flesh and the union, and the assumed nature did not precede the assumption and the union, then <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> and union signify one and the same thing, and so before the union and <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> there was one nature, while after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> we speak properly of two, of that which took and of that which was taken.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I say that Christ was of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, but I deny two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Explain to us then in what sense you understand the expression <q>of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>;</q> like gilded silver? Like the composition of electron?  like the solder made of lead and tin?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I deny that the union is like any of these; it is ineffable, and passes all understanding.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I too confess that the manner of the union cannot be comprehended. But I have at all events been instructed by the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> that each nature remains unimpaired after the union.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; And where is this taught in the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; It is all full of this teaching.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of what you assert.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Do you not acknowledge the properties of each nature?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; No: not, that is, after the union.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Let us then learn this very point from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I am ready to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; When, then, you hear the divine John exclaiming <q>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the word was God</q>  and <q>By Him all things were made</q>  and the rest of the parallel passages, do you affirm that the flesh, or the divine Word, begotten before the ages of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was by nature <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and made all things?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I say that these things belong to <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>. But I do not separate Him from the flesh made one with Him.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Neither do we separate the flesh from <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, nor do we make the union a confusion.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I recognise one nature after the union.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; When did the Evangelists write the gospel? Was it before the union, or a very long time after the union?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Plainly after the union, the nativity, the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the passion, the resurrection, the taking up into heaven, and the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Hear then John saying <q>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the word was God. He was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made</q>  and so on. Hear too Matthew, <q>The book of the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Son of David,&mdash; Son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,</q>&mdash; and so on.  Luke too traced His genealogy to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and David.  Now make the former and the latter quotation fit one nature. You will find it impossible, for <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the beginning, and descent from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>&mdash;the making of all things, and derivation from a created forefather, are inconsistent.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; By thus arguing you divide the only begotten son into two Persons.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; One <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> I both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and adore, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>; but I have been taught the difference between His Godhead and his manhood. You, however, who say that there is only one nature after the union, do you make this agree with the introductions of the Evangelists.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You appear to assume the proposition to be hard, nay impossible. Be it, I beg, short and easy&mdash;only solve our question.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Both qualities are proper to the Lord Christ,&mdash; <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the beginning, and generation, according to the flesh, from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and David.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You laid down the law that after the union it is not right to speak of one nature. Take heed lest in mentioning the flesh you transgress your own law.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Even without mentioning the flesh it is quite easy to explain the point in question, for I am applying both to the Saviour Christ.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I too assert that both these qualities belong to the Lord Christ.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yes; but you do so in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in Him, and applying to each its own properties. But if the Christ is one nature, how is it possible to attribute to it properties which are inconsistent with one another? For to have derived origin from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and David, and still more to have been born many generations after David, is inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the beginning. Again to have sprung from created beings is inconsistent with being Creator of all things; to have had <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fathers with <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> derived from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In short the new is inconsistent with the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<p>Let us also look at the matter in this way. Do we say that the divine Word is Creator of the Universe?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; So we have learned to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And how many days after the creation of heaven and earth are we told that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was formed?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; On the sixth day.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> how many generations went by?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I think twenty.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to Christ our Saviour how many generations are reckoned by the Evangelist Matthew.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Forty-two. </p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; If then the Lord Christ is one nature how can He be Creator of all things visible and invisible and, at the same time, after so many generations, have been formed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> womb? And how could He be at one and the same time Creator of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and Son of Adam's descendants?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I have already said that both these properties are appropriate to Him as God made flesh, for I recognise one nature made flesh of the Word.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Nor yet, my good sir, do we say that two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of the divine Word were made flesh, for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the divine Word is one, but we have been taught that the flesh of which He availed Himself when He was incarnate is of another nature, and here I think that you too agree with me. Tell me now; after what manner do you say that the making flesh took place?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the manner, but I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He was made flesh.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; You make a pretext of your <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> unfairly, and after the fashion of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. For they when they beheld the force of the Lord's enquiry, and suspecting that they were on the point of conviction, uttered their reply <q>We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q>  But I proclaim quite openly that the divine <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> is without change. For if by any variation or change He was made flesh, then after the change all that is divine in His names and in His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> is quite inappropriate to Him.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; We have agreed again and again that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> is immutable.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; He was made flesh by taking flesh.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The nature of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> made flesh is different from that of the flesh, by assumption of which the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a> and became man.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Agreed.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Was He then changed into flesh?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Certainly not.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; If then He was made flesh, not by mutation, but by taking flesh, and both the former and the latter qualities are appropriate to Him as to God made flesh, as you said a moment ago, then the natures were not confounded, but remained unimpaired. And as long as we hold thus we shall perceive too the harmony of the Evangelists, for while the one proclaims the divine attributes of the one only begotten&mdash; the Lord Christ&mdash; the other sets forth His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> qualities. So too Christ our Lord Himself teaches us, at one time calling Himself <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and at another <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>: at one time He gives <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to His Mother as to her that gave Him birth;  at another He rebukes her as her Lord.  At one time He finds no fault with them that style Him Son of David; at another He teaches the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that He is not only David's Son but also David's Lord.  He calls <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> and Capernaum His country,  and again He exclaims <q>Before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was I am.</q>  You will find the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> full of similar passages, and they all point not to one nature but to two.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; He who contemplates two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in the Christ divides the one only begotten into two sons.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yes; and he who says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is made up of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body makes two Pauls out of one.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; The analogy does not hold good.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it does not,  for here the union is a natural union of parts that are co&aelig;val, created, and fellow slaves, but in the case of the Lord Christ all is of good will, of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Here too, though the union is natural, the proper qualities of the natures remain unimpaired.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; If the proper qualities of the natures remain distinct, how does the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> together with the body crave for food?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not crave for food. How could it when it is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>? But the body, which derives its vital force from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, feels its need, and desires to receive what is lacking. So after toil it longs for rest, after waking for sleep, and so with the rest of its desires. So immediately after its dissolution, since it has no longer its vital energy, it does not even crave for what is lacking, and, ceasing to receive it, it undergoes corruption.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You see that to thirst and to hunger and similar appetites belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Did these belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> it would suffer hunger and thirst, and the similar wants, even after its release from the body.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; What then do you say to be proper to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? </p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The reasonable, the absolute, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, the invisible.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; And what of the body?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The complex, the visible, the mortal.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; And we say that man is composed of these?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yes.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Then we define  man as a mortal reasonable being.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Agreed.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; And we give names to him from both these attributes.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yes.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; As then in this case we make no distinction, but call the same man both reasonable and mortal, so also should we do in the case of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and apply to Him both the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; This is our argument, although you do not accurately express it. For look you. When we are pursuing the argument about the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, do we only mention what is appropriate to its energy and nature?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; This only.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And when our discussion is about the body, do we not only recall what is appropriate to it?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Quite so.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But, when our discourse touches the whole being, then we have no difficulty in adducing both sets of qualities, for the properties both of the body and of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are applicable to man.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Unquestionably.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Well; just in this way should we speak of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and, when arguing about His natures, give to each its own, and recognise some as belonging to the Godhead, and some as to the manhood. But when we are discussing the Person we must then make what is proper to the natures common, and apply both sets of qualities to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and call the same Being both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>, both <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>&mdash; both David's Son and David's Lord, both Seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Creator of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and so on.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; That the person of the Christ is one, and that both the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> are attributable to Him, you have quite rightly said, and I accept this definition of the Faith; but your real position, that in discussing the natures we must give to each its own properties, seems to me to dissolve the union. It is for this reason that I object to accept these and similar arguments.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yet when we were enquiring about <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body you thought the distinction of these terms admirable, and immediately gave it your approbation. Why then do you refuse to receive the same rule in the case of the Godhead and manhood of the Lord Christ? Do you go so far as to object to comparing the Godhead and the manhood of the Christ to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body? So, while you grant an unconfounded union to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, do you venture to say that the Godhead and manhood of the Christ have undergone commixture and confusion?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I hold the Godhead of the Christ aye, and His flesh too, to be infinitely higher in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> than <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; but after the union I do assert one nature.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But now is it not impious and shocking, while maintaining that a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united to a body is in no way subject to confusion, to deny to the Godhead of the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> the power to maintain its own nature unconfounded or to keep within its proper bounds the humanity which He assumed? Is it not, I say, impious to mix the distinct, and to commingle the separate? The idea of one nature gives ground for suspicion of this confusion.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I am equally anxious to avoid the term confusion, but I shrink from asserting two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> lest I fall into a <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> of sons.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I am equally anxious to escape either horn of the dilemma, both the impious confusion and the impious distinction; for to me it is alike an unhallowed thought to split the one Son in two and to gainsay the duality of the natures. But now in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> name tell me. Were one of the faction of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> or Eunomius to endeavour, while disputing with you, to belittle the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and to describe Him as less than and inferior to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by the help of all their familiar arguments and citations from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> of the text <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me</q>  and that other, <q>Now is my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> troubled</q>  and other like passages, how would you dispose of his objections? How could you show that the Son is in no way diminished in dignity by these expressions and is not of another substance, but begotten of the substance of the Father?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I should say that the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> uses some terms according to the theology and some according to the &oelig;conomy, and that it is wrong to apply what belongs to the &oelig;conomy to what belongs to the theology. </p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But your opponent would retort that even in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> says many things &oelig;conomically, as for instance, <q>Adam heard the voice of the Lord God walking,</q>  and <q>I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which has come to me; and if not I will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q>  and again, <q>Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you fear God</q>  and the like.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I might answer to this that there is a great distinction between the &oelig;conomies. In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> there is an &oelig;conomy of words; in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then your opponent would ask of what <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; He shall straightway hear of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the making flesh. For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> on being made man both in word and deed at one time exhibits the flesh, at another the Godhead: as of course, in the passage quoted, He shows the weakness of the flesh and of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the sense namely of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But if he were to go on to say, <q>But he did not take a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but only a body; for the Godhead instead of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being united to the body performed all the functions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,</q> with what arguments could you meet his objections?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I could bring <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> showing how <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> took not only flesh but also <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And what <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of this shall we find in Scripture?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Have you not heard the Lord saying <q>I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again....I lay it down of myself that I might take it again.</q>  And again, <q>Now is my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> troubled.</q>  And again, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is exceeding sorrowful even unto death,</q>  and again David's words as interpreted by Peter <q>His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not left in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> neither did His flesh see corruption.</q>  These and similar passages clearly point out that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> assumed not only a body but also a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; You have quoted this testimony most appositely and properly, but your opponent might reply that even before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> God said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>Fasting and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day and feasts my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>.</q>  Then he might go on to argue that as in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> He mentioned a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, though He had not a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so He does in the New.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; But he shall be told again how the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>, when speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, mentions even parts of the body as <q>Incline your ear and hear</q>  and <q>Open your eyes and see</q>  and <q>The mouth of the Lord has spoken it</q>  and <q>Your hands have made me and fashioned me</q>  and countless other passages.</p>

<p>If then after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> we are forbidden to understand <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to mean <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it is equally forbidden to hold body to mean body. Thus the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the &oelig;conomy will be found to be mere imagination; and we shall in no way differ from <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and Manes, the inventors of all these figments.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But if a follower of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> were suddenly to intervene in our discussion and were to ask <q>Most excellent Sir; what kind of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> do you say that Christ assumed?</q> what would you answer?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I should first of all say that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man; then I should answer, <q>But if you reckon two <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the one reasonable and the other without reason, I say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> assumed was the reasonable. Yours it seems is the unreasonable, inasmuch as you think that our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was incomplete.</q></p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But suppose he were to ask for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of what you say?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I could very easily give it. I shall quote the oracles of the Evangelists <q>The Child Jesus grew and waxed strong in spirit and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God was upon him</q>  and again <q>Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favour with God and men.</q>  I should say that these have nothing to do with Godhead for the body increased in stature, and in wisdom the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash; not that which is without reason, but the reasonable. <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> then took on Him a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Good Sir, you have bravely broken through the three fold phalanx of your foes; but that union, and the famous commixture and confusion, not in two ways only but in three, you have scattered and undone; and not only have you pointed out the distinction between Godhead and manhood, but you have in two ways distinguished the manhood by pointing out that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is one thing and the body another, so that no longer two, according to our argument, but three natures of our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> may be understood.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes; for did not you say that there is another substance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> besides the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yes.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; How then does the argument seem absurd to you?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Because while you object to two, you have admitted three natures.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; The contest with our antagonists compels us to this, for how could any one in any other way argue against those who deny the assumption of the flesh, or of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but by adducing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> on these points from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>? And how could any one confute them who in their readiness strive to belittle the Godhead of the only Begotten but by pointing out that the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> speaks sometimes theologically and sometimes &oelig;conomically.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; What you now say is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. It is what I, nay what all say, who keep whole the apostolic rule. You yourself have become a supporter of our doctrines.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; How do I support yours, while I refuse to acknowledge two sons?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; When did you ever hear of our affirming two sons?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; He who asserts two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> asserts two sons.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then you assert three sons, for you have spoken of three natures.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; In no other way was it possible to meet the argument of my opponents.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Hear this same thing from us too; for both you and I confront the same antagonists.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; But I do not assert two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> after the union.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And yet after many generations of the union a moment ago you used the same words. Explain to us however in what sense you assert one nature after the union. Do you mean one nature derived from both or that one nature remains after the destruction of the other?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I maintain that the Godhead remains and that the manhood was swallowed up by it. </p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Fables of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, all this, and follies of the Manichees. I am ashamed so much as to mention such things. The Greeks had their gods' swallowings  and the Manichees wrote of the daughter of light. But we reject such teaching as being as absurd as it is impious, for how could a nature absolute and uncompounded, comprehending the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, unapproachable and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, have absorbed the nature which it assumed?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Like the sea receiving a drop of honey, for straightway the drop, as it mingles with the ocean's water, disappears.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The sea and the drop are different in quantity, though alike in quality; the one is greatest, the other is least; the one is sweet and the other is bitter; but in all other respects you will find a very close relationship. The nature of both is moist, liquid, and fluid. Both are created. Both are lifeless yet each alike is called a body. There is nothing then absurd in these cognate natures undergoing commixture, and in the one being made to disappear by the other. In the case before us on the contrary the difference is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and so great that no figure of the reality can be found. I will however endeavour to point out to you several instances of substances which are mixed without being confounded, and remain unimpaired.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Who in the world ever heard of an unmixed mixture?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I shall endeavour to make you admit this.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Should what you are about to advance prove <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> we will not oppose the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Answer then, dissenting or assenting as the argument may seem good to you.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I will answer.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Does the light at its rising seem to you to fill all the atmosphere except where men shut up in caverns might remain bereft of it?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And does all the light seem to you to be diffused through all the atmosphere?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I am with you so far.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And is not the mixture diffused through all that is subject to it?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Certainly.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But, now, this illuminated atmosphere, do we not see it as light and call it light?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Quite so.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And yet when the light is present we sometimes are aware of moisture and aridity; frequently of heat and cold.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And after the departure of the light the atmosphere afterwards remains alone by itself.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; True.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Consider this example too. When iron is brought in contact with fire it is fired.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Certainly.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And the fire is diffused through its whole substance?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Well?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; How, then, does not the complete union, and the mixture universally diffused, change the iron's nature?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; But it changes it altogether. It is now reckoned no longer as iron, but as fire, and indeed it has the active properties of fire.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But does not the smith call it iron, and put it on the anvil and smite it with his hammer?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Unquestionably.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the iron was not damaged by contact with the fire. If then, in natural bodies, instances may be found of an unconfounded mixture, it is sheer folly in the case of the nature which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> neither corruption nor change to entertain the idea of confusion and destruction of the assumed nature, and all the more so when this nature was assumed to bring blessing on the race.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; What I assert is not the destruction of the assumed nature, but its change into the substance of Godhead.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is no longer limited as heretofore?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; No.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; When did it undergo this change?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; After the complete union.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; And what date do you assign to this?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I have said again and again, that of the conception.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yet after the conception He was an unborn babe in the womb; after His birth. He was a babe  and was called a babe, and was worshipped by shepherds, and in like manner became a boy, and was so called by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.  Do you acknowledge all this? Or do you think I am inventing fables?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; This is taught in the history of the divine <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>, and cannot be gainsaid.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Now let us investigate what follows. We acknowledge, do we not, that the Lord was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Of what was there a <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>? Of flesh or Godhead?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Of the flesh.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Of what was then the growth and increase in wisdom and stature?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; This, of course, is not applicable to Godhead.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Nor hunger and thirst?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; No.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Nor walking about, and being weary, and falling asleep?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; No.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; If then the union took place at the conception, and all these things came to pass after the conception and the birth, then, after the union, the manhood did not lose its own nature.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I have not stated my meaning exactly. It was after the resurrection from the dead that the flesh underwent the change into Godhead.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Then, after the resurrection, nothing of all that indicates its nature remained in it?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; If it remained, the divine change did not take place.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; How then was it that He showed His hands and His feet to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who disbelieved?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Just as He came in when the doors were shut.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But He came in when the doors were shut just as He came out from the womb, though the virgin's bolts and bars were undrawn, and just as He walked upon the sea. Then according to your argument not even yet had the change of nature taken place?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; The Lord showed His hands to the Apostles in the same way as He wrestled with Jacob.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; No; the Lord does not allow us to understand it in this sense. The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> thought they saw a spirit, but the Lord dispelled this idea, and showed the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the flesh, for He said <q>Why are you troubled? And why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.</q>  And observe the exactness of the language. He does not say <q>is not flesh and bones,</q> but <q>has not flesh and bones,</q> in order to point out that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the possessor and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that which is possessed are distinct and separate. Just in the same way that which took and that which was taken are separate and distinct, and the Christ is beheld made one of both. Thus the part possessing is entirely different from the part possessed; and yet does not divide into two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> Him who is an object of thought in them. The Lord, indeed, while the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were still in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, asked for food and took and ate it, not consuming the food only in appearance, nor satisfying to the need of the body.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; But one of these alternatives must be accepted; either He partook because He needed, or else, needing not, He seemed to eat, and did not really partake of food.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; His body now become <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> required no food. Of them that rise the Lord says: <q>they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as Angels.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> however bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that He partook of the food, for the blessed Luke in the preface to the Acts says <q>being assembled together with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> the Lord commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem</q>  and the very divine Peter says more distinctly: <q>Who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.</q>  For since eating is proper to them that live this present life, of necessity the Lord by means of eating and drinking <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the resurrection of the flesh to them that did not acknowledge it to be real. This same course He pursued in the case of Lazarus and of Jairus' daughter. For when He had raised up the latter He ordered that something should be given her to eat  and He made Lazarus sit with Him at the table  and so showed the reality of the rising again.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; If we grant that the Lord really ate, let us grant that after the resurrection all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> partake of food.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; What was done by the Saviour through a certain &oelig;conomy is not a rule and law of nature. This follows from the fact that He did other things by &oelig;conomy which shall by no means be the lot of them that live again.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; What do you mean?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Will not the bodies of them that rise become incorruptible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; So the divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has taught us. <q>It is sown</q> he says <q>in corruption; it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.</q> </p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; But the Lord, who raises the bodies of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, unmaimed and unmarred (for lameness of limb and blindness of eye are unknown among them that are risen),  left in His own body the prints of the nails, and the wound in His side, whereof are witnesses both the Lord Himself and the hand of Thomas.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; True.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; If then after the resurrection the Lord both partook of food, and showed His hands and His feet to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and in them the prints of the nails, and His side with the mark of the wound in it, and said to them, <q>Handle me and see for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see me have</q>  it follows that after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His body was preserved and was not changed into another substance.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Then after the resurrection it is mortal and subject to suffering?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; By no means; it is incorruptible, impassible, and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; If it is incorruptible, impassible, and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, it has been changed into another nature.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Therefore the bodies of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> will be changed into another substance, for all will be incorruptible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. Or have you not heard the words of the Apostle, <q>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a></q>? </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I have heard.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Therefore the nature remains, but its corruption is changed into incorruption, and its mortal into <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. But let us look at the matter in this way; we call a body that is sick and a body that is whole, in the same way, a body.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Unquestionably.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Wherefore?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Since both partake of the same substance.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Yet we see in them a very great difference, for the one is whole, perfect, and unhurt; the other has either lost an eye, or has a broken leg, or has undergone some other suffering.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; But to the same nature belong both health and sickness.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; So the body is called substance; disease and health are called accident.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Of course. For these things are accidents of the body, and again cease to be so.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; In the same way corruption and death must be called accidents, and not substances, for they too are accidents and cease to be so.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; True.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; So the body of the Lord rose incorruptible, impassible, and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and is worshipped by the powers of heaven, and is yet a body having its former limitation.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; In these points you seem to say truth, but after its assumption into heaven I do not think that you will deny that it was changed into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Godhead.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I would not so say persuaded only by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> arguments, for I am not so rash as to say anything concerning which <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> is silent. But I have heard the divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> exclaiming <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has appointed a day in the which He will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom He has ordained whereof He has given assurance unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in that He has raised Him from the dead,</q>  and I have learned from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Angels that He will come in like manner as the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> saw Him going into heaven.  Now they saw His nature not unlimited. For I have heard the words of the Lord, <q>You shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> coming in the clouds of heaven,</q>  and I acknowledge that what is seen of men is limited, for the unlimited nature is invisible. Furthermore to sit upon a throne of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and to set the lambs upon the right and the kids upon the left  indicates limitation.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Then He was not unlimited even before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> saw Him surrounded by the Seraphim. </p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> did not see the substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but a certain appearance accommodated to his capacity. After the resurrection, however, all the world will see the very visible nature of the judge.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You promised that you would adduce no argument without evidence, but you are introducing arguments adapted to us.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I have learned these things from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>. I have heard the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Zechariah <q>They shall look on Him whom they pierced,</q>  and how shall the event follow the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> unless the crucifiers recognise the nature which they crucified? And I have heard the cry of the victorious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Stephen, <q>Behold I see the heavens opened and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> standing on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  and he saw the visible, not the invisible nature.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; These things are thus written, but I do not think that you will be able to show that the body, after the ascension into heaven, is called body by the inspired writers.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; What has been already said indicates the body perfectly plainly; for what is seen is a body; but I will nevertheless point out to you that even after the assumption the body of the Lord is called a body. Hear the teaching of the Apostle, <q>For our conversation is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> from whence also we look for the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> body.</q>  It was not changed into another nature, but remained a body, full however of divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and sending forth beams of light. The bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall be fashioned like it. But if it was changed into another nature, their bodies will be likewise changed, for they shall be fashioned like it. But if the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> preserve the character of their nature, then also the body of the Lord in like manner keeps its own nature unchanged.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Then will the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> be equal with the body of the Lord?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; In its incorruption and its <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> they too will share. Moreover in its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> they will participate, as says the Apostle, <q>If so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> together.</q>  It is in quantity that the vast difference may be found, a difference as great as between sun and stars, or rather between master and slaves, and that which gives and that which receives light. Yet has He given a share of His own name to His servants and as He is Light, calls His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> light, for <q>You,</q> He says, <q>are the Light of the world,</q>  and being named servants and being named <q>Sun of Righteousness</q>  He says of his servants <q>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun.</q>  It is therefore according to quality, not according to quantity, that the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall be fashioned like the body of the Lord. Now I have shown you plainly what you bade me. Further, if you please, let us look at the matter in yet another way.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; One ought <q>to stir every stone,</q> as the proverb says,  to get at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; above all when it is a question of divine doctrines.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Tell me now; the mystic <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> which are offered to God by them who perform <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, of what are they <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Of the body and blood of the Lord.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Of the real body or not?</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; The real.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Good. For there must be the archetype of the image. So painters imitate nature and paint the images of visible objects.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; True.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; If, then, the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> are antitypes of the real body,  therefore even now the body of the Lord is a body, not changed into nature of Godhead, but filled with divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You have opportunely introduced the subject of the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> for from it I shall be able to show you the change of the Lord's body into another nature. Answer now to my questions.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I will answer.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; What do you call the gift which is offered before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> invocation?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; It were wrong to say openly; perhaps some uninitiated are present.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Let your answer be put enigmatically.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Food of grain of such a sort.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; And how name we the other <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; This name too is common, signifying species of drink.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; And after the consecration how do you name these?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; Christ's body and Christ's blood.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; And do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you partake of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and blood?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I do.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; As, then, the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of the Lord's body and blood are one thing before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> invocation, and after the invocation are changed and become another thing; so the Lord's body after the assumption is changed into the divine substance.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; You are caught in the net you have woven yourself. For even after the consecration the mystic <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> are not deprived  of their own nature; they remain in their former substance figure and form; they are visible and tangible as they were before. But they are regarded as what they have become, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> so to be, and are worshipped  as being what they are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be. Compare then the image with the archetype, and you will see the likeness, for the type must be like the reality. For that body preserves its former form, figure, and limitation and in a word the substance of the body; but after the resurrection it has become <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and superior to corruption; it has become worthy of a seat on the right hand; it is adored by every creature as being called the natural body of the Lord.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; Yes; and the mystic <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> changes its former appellation; it is no longer called by the name it went by before, but is styled body. So must the reality be called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not body.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; You seem to me to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>&mdash; for He is called not only body but even bread of life. So the Lord Himself used this name  and that very body we call divine body, and giver of life, and of the Master and of the Lord, teaching that it is not common to every man but belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>. <q>For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></q> is <q>the same yesterday, today, and forever.</q> </p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You have said a great deal about this, but I follow the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who have shone of old in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; show me then, if you can, these in their writings dividing the natures after the union.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; I will read you their works, and I am sure you will be astonished at the countless mentions of the distinction which in their struggle against impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> they have inserted in their writings. Hear now those whose testimony I have already adduced speaking openly and distinctly on these points.</p>

<p> <em>Testimony of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Ignatius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>From the Epistle to the Smyrn&aelig;ans:  <q>I acknowledge and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> to be existent in the flesh: and when He came to them that were with Peter He said to them 'Take; handle me and see, for I am not a bodiless d&aelig;mon.'  And straightway they took hold of him and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same epistle:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>And after His Resurrection He ate with them, and drank with them, as being of the flesh, although He was spiritually one with the Father.</q></p>

<p> <em>Testimony of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, the ancient <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>;</em>&mdash; </p>

<p>From the third Book of his work <q>Against Heresies.</q> (Chap. XX.)</p>

<p><q>As we have said before, He united man to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For had not a man vanquished man's adversary, the enemy would not have been vanquished aright; and again, had not God granted the boon of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> we should not have possessed it in security. And had not man been united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he could not have shared in the incorruption. For it behooved the mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men, by means of His close kinship to either, to bring them both into friendship and unanimity, and to set man close to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to make God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to men.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the third book of the same treatise (Chapter XVIII):&mdash; </p>

<p><q>So again in his Epistle he says 'Whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,'  recognising one and the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to whom the gates of heaven were opened, on account of His assumption in the flesh. Who in the same flesh in which He also suffered shall come revealing the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the fourth book (Chapter VII):&mdash; </p>

<p><q>As Isaiah says 'He shall <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them that come of Jacob to take root. <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit.'  So his fruit being scattered through the whole world, they who erst brought forth good fruit (for of them was produced the Christ in the flesh and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>) were abandoned and removed. And now they are no longer fit for bringing forth fruit.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same book (Chapter LIX):&mdash; </p>

<p><q>And he judges also them of Ebion.  How can they be saved unless it was God who wrought their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> on earth, or how shall man come to God unless God came to man?</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same book (Chapter LXIV):&mdash; </p>

<p><q>They who preach that <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> was of the Virgin set forth the union of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> with His creature.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same treatise (Book V. Chap. I.):&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Now these things came to pass not in seeming but in essential <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for if He appeared to be man though He was not man then the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> did not continue to be what in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> It is; for the Spirit is invisible; nor was there any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in Him, for He was not what He appeared to be. And we have said before that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> beheld Him in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> prophesying what was destined to come to pass in actual sight. If then now too He appeared to be of such a character, though in reality He was not what He appeared, then a kind of prophetic vision would have been given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and we must still look for yet another advent in which He will really be what He is now seen to be in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Now we have demonstrated that there is no difference between the statements that He only appeared in seeming and that He took nothing from Mary, for He did not really even possess flesh and blood whereby He redeemed us, unless He renewed in Himself the old creation of Adam. The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> are therefore vain in teaching thus that they may cast out the life of the flesh.</q></p>

<p> <em>Testimony of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Hippolytus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, from his work on the distribution of the talents:</em> &mdash; </p>

<p><q>Any one might say that these and those who uphold otherwise are neighbours, erring as they do in the same manner, for even they either confess that the Christ appeared in life as mere man, denying the talent of His Godhead, or else acknowledging Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on the other hand they deny the man, representing that He deluded the sight of them that beheld Him by unreal appearances; and that He wore manhood not as a Man but was rather a mere imaginary semblance, as <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> teach, wrenching away the Word from the flesh, and rejecting the one talent, the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his letter to a certain Queen: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>He calls Him 'the first fruits of them that sleep,' as being 'the first born from the dead,'  and He, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, wishing to show that that which was risen was the same as that which had undergone death, when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were doubting, called Thomas to Him, and said, 'Come hither handle me and see for a spirit has not flesh and blood as you see me have.'</q> </p>

<p>Of the same from his discourse on Elkanah and Hannah:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Wherefore three seasons of the year typified the Saviour Himself that He might fulfil the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> predicted about Him. In the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, that He might show Himself as the sheep doomed to be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> and show a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> as says the Apostle, 'Christ, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  our <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for us.' At Pentecost that He might announce the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> ascending Himself first into heaven and offering to God man as a gift.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his work on the great Psalm: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>He who drew from the nethermost <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> man first formed of the earth when lost and held fast in bonds of death; He who came down from above and lifted up him that was down; He who became Evangelist of the dead, ransomer of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and resurrection of them that were entombed; this was He who became succourer of vanquished man in Himself, like man <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> Word; visiting the first formed <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in the Virgin; the spiritual seeking the earthy in the womb; the ever-living him who by disobedience died; the heavenly calling the earthly to the world above, the highborn meaning to make the slave free by His own <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>; He who turned to adamant man crumbled into dust and made serpents' meat; He who made man hanging on a tree of wood Lord over him who had conquered Him and so by a tree of wood is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> victorious.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same book:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>They who do not now recognise the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the flesh will one day recognise Him when He comes as judge in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, though now in an inglorious body suffering wrong.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same book:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Moreover the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> when they had come to the sepulchre on the third day did not find the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, just as the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> went up on the mountain, and could not find the tomb of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his interpretation of Psalm II.:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>When He had come into the world He was manifested as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>. His manhood is easy of perception because He is ahungered and aweary, in toil He is thirsty, in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> He flees,  in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> He grieves; He falls asleep upon a pillow, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that the cup of suffering may pass from Him, being in an agony He sweats, He is strengthened by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, betrayed by Judas, dishonoured by <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, set at nought by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, scourged by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, mocked by soldiers, nailed to a cross by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, He commends His spirit to the Father with a cry, He leans His head as He breathes His last, He is pierced in the side with a spear and rolled in fine linen, is laid in a tomb, and on the third day He is raised by the Father. No less plainly may His divinity be seen when He is worshipped by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, gazed on by shepherds, waited for by Simeon, testified to by Anna, sought out by <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, pointed out by a Star, at the wedding feast makes water wine, rebukes the sea astir by force of winds, and on the same sea walks, makes a man blind from birth see, raises Lazarus who had been four days dead, works many and various wonders, remits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and gives power to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his work on Psalm XXIV.:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>He comes to the heavenly gates, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> travel with Him and the gates of the heavens are shut. For He has not yet ascended into heaven. Now first to the heavenly powers flesh appears ascending. The Word then goes forth to the powers from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that speed before the Lord and Saviour, 'Lift the Gates ye princes and be lifted up ye everlasting doors and the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall come in.'</q> </p>

<p> <em>Testimony of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Eustathius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and confessor.</em></p>

<p>From his work on The Titles of the Psalms:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>He predicted that He would sit upon a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> throne, showing that He has been set forth on the same throne as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">divine Spirit</a> on account of the God that dwells in Him continually.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his work upon the Soul:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Before His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> in each case He predicted His bodily death, saying that He would be betrayed to the father of the High Priest, and announcing the trophy of the Cross. And after the passion, when He had risen on the third day from the dead, His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> being in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, He appeared to them in His very body and confessed that He had complete flesh and bones, submitting to their sight His wounded side and showing them the prints of the nails.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his discourse on <q>The Lord formed me in the beginning of His ways</q>: &mdash; </p>

<p><q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> did not say 'conformed to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>' but 'conformed to the image of His Son?'  in order to point out a distinction between the Son and His image, for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, wearing the divine tokens of His Father's Excellence, is an image of His Father; for since like are generated of like, offspring appear as very images of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, but the manhood which He wore is an image of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as images even of different colours are painted on wax,  some being wrought by hand and some by nature and likeness. Moreover the very law of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> announces this, for the bodiless spirit of wisdom is not conformed to bodily men, but the express image  made man by the spirit bearing the same number of members with all the rest, and clad in similar form.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same work:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>That he speaks of the body as conformed to those of men he teaches more clearly in his Epistle to the Philippians, 'our conversation' he says 'is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> from whence also we look for the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> body.'  And if by changing the form of the vile body of men He fashions it like His own body, then the false teaching of our opponents is shown to be in every way worthless.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same work:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>But as being born of the Virgin He is said to have been made man of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,  so He is described as being made under the law because of His sometimes walking by the precepts of the law, as for instance when His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> urged His <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, when He was a child eight days old, as relates the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> Luke, afterwards 'they brought Him to present Him to the Lord,' 'bringing the offerings of purification' 'to offer a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> according to that which is said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.'  As then the gifts of purification were offered on His behalf according to the law, and He underwent <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> on the eighth day, the Apostle very properly writes that He was thus brought under the law. Not indeed that the Word was subject to the law, (as our <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> opponents suppose) being Himself the law, nor did <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who by one breath can cleanse and hallow all things, need <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of purification. But He took from the Virgin the members of a man and became subject to the law and was purified according to the rite of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>, not because He submitted to this treatment from any need on His part of such observance, but in order that He might redeem from the slavery of the law them that were sold to the doom of the curse.</q></p>

<p> <em>Testimony of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Athanasius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria.</em></p>

<p>From his Second Discourse against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>We should not have been redeemed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the curse had not the flesh which the Word wore been by nature that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for we should have had nothing in common with that which was not our own; just so man would not have been made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had not the Word which was made flesh been by nature of the Father and verily and properly His. And the combination is of this character that to the natural God may be joined the natural man, and so his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and deification be secure. Therefore let them that deny Him to be naturally of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and own Son of His substance, deny too that He took very flesh of man from the Virgin Mary.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his Epistle to Epictetus:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>If on account of the Saviour's Body being, and being described in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> as being, derived from Mary, and a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> Body, they fancy that a quaternity is substituted for a Trinity, as though some addition were made by the body, they are quite wrong; they put the creature on a par with the Creator, and suppose that the Godhead is capable of being added to. They fail to see that the Word was not made flesh on account of any addition to Godhead, but that the flesh may rise. Not for the aggrandisement of the Word did He come forth from Mary, but that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> may be redeemed. How can they think that the body ransomed and quickened by the Word can add anything in the way of Godhead to the Word that quickened it?</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same Epistle:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Let them be told that if the Word had been a creature, the creature would not have assumed a body to quicken it. For what help can creatures get from a creature standing itself in need of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? But the Word, Himself Creator, was made maker of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, and therefore in the fullness of the ages He attached the creature to Himself, that once more as a Creator He might renew it, and might be able to create it afresh.</q></p>

<p>From the longer Discourse <q>De Fide</q>:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>This also we add concerning the words 'Sit on my right hand,'  that they are said of the Lord's body. For if 'the Lord says, do not I fill heaven and earth,'  as says Jeremiah, and God contains all things, and is contained of none, on what kind of throne does He sit? It is therefore the body to which He says 'Sit on my right hand,' of which too the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> with his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> powers was foe, and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> too. Through this body too He was made and was called High Priest and Apostle through the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> whereof He gave to us, saying 'This is my Body for you'  and 'my Blood of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>' (not of the Old), shed for you.</q>  Now Godhead has neither body nor blood; but the manhood which He bore of Mary was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of them, of whom the Apostles said '<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, a man approved of God among you.' </p>

<p>Of the same from his book against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>And when he says 'Wherefore God has also highly exalted Him and given Him a name which is above every name'  he speaks of the temple of the body, not of the Godhead, for the Most High is not exalted, but the flesh of the Most High is exalted, and to the flesh of the Most High He gave a name which is above every name. Nor did the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> receive the designation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as a favour, but His flesh was held divine as well as Himself.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same work:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>And when he says 'the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was not yet because that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>,'  he says that His flesh was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, for the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, but the flesh itself receives <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord as it mounts with Him into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>; whence he says the spirit of adoption was not yet among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because the first fruits taken from men had not yet ascended into heaven. Wherever then the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that the Son received and was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, it speaks because of His manhood, not His Godhead.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same work:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>So that He is very God both before His being made man and after His being made mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> united to the Father in spirit, and to us in flesh, who mediated between God and men, and who is not only man but also God.</q></p>

<p> <em>Testimony of the Holy Ambrosius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Milan.</em></p>

<p>In his Exposition of the Faith:&mdash; </p>

<p>We confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Only Begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, was begotten before all ages, without beginning, of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that in these last days the same was made flesh of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin Mary, assumed the manhood, in its perfection, of a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, of one substance with the Father as touching His Godhead and of one substance with us as touching His manhood. For union of two perfect natures has been after an ineffable manner. Wherefore we acknowledge one Christ, one Son, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that being coeternal with His own Father as touching His Godhead, by virtue of which also He is creator of all, He deigned, after the assent of the Holy Virgin, when she said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to your word'  to build after an ineffable fashion a temple out of her for Himself, and to unite this temple to Himself by her conception, not taking and uniting with Himself a body coeternal with His own substance, and brought from heaven, but of the matter of our substance, that is of the Virgin. <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was not turned into flesh; His appearance was not unreal; keeping ever His own substance immutably and invariably He took the first fruits of our nature, and united them to Himself. <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> did not take His beginning from the Virgin, but being coeternal with His own Father He of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> kindness deigned to unite to Himself the first fruits of our nature, undergoing no mixture but in either substance appearing one and the same, as it is written 'Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.'  For the divine Christ, as touching my substance which he took is destroyed, and the same Christ raises the destroyed temple as touching the divine substance in which also He is Creator of all things. Never at any time after the Union which He deigned to make with Himself from the moment of the conception did He depart from His own temple, nor indeed through His ineffable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> could depart.</p>

<p>The same Christ is both passible and impassible; as touching His manhood passible and as touching His Godhead impassible. 'Behold behold me, it is I, I have undergone no change'&mdash; and when <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> had raised His own temple and in it had wrought out the resurrection and renewal of our nature, He showed this nature to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and said 'Handle me and see for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see me,' not 'be' but 'have.'  So He says, referring to both the possessor and the possessed in order that you may perceive that what had taken place was not mixture, not change, not variation, but union. On this account too He showed the prints of the nails and the wound of the spear and ate before His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to convince them by every means that the resurrection of our nature had been renewed in Him; and further because in accordance with the blessed substance of His Godhead unchanged, impassible, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, He lived in need of nought, He by concession permitted all that can be felt to be brought to His own temple, and by His own power raised it up, and by means of His own temple made perfect the renewal of our nature.</p>

<p><q>Them therefore that assert that the Christ was mere man, that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was passible, or changed into flesh, or that the body which He had was consubstantial, or that He brought it from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, or that it was an unreality; or assert that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> being mortal needed to receive His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or that the body which He assumed was without a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or manhood without a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or that the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of the Christ became one nature by confusion and commixture; them that deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> was two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> unconfounded, but one person, as He is one Christ and one Son, all these the catholic and apostolic Church condemns.</q></p>

<p>Of the same: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>If then the flesh of all was in Christ or has been in Christ subject to wrongs, how can it be held to be of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> with the Godhead? For if the Word and the flesh which derives its nature from earth are of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, then the Word and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which He took in its perfection are of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, for the Word is of one nature with God both according to the Word of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the confession of the Son Himself in the words, 'I and my Father are one.'  Thus the Father must be held to be of the same substance with the body. Why any longer are you <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, who say that the Son is a creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while you assert yourselves that the Father is of one substance with His creatures?</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his letter to the Emperor Gratianus: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>Let us preserve a distinction between Godhead and flesh. One <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> speaks in both, since in Him both natures exist. The same Christ speaks, yet not always in the same but sometimes in a different manner. Observe how at one time He expresses divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and at another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feeling. As God He utters the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He is the Word; as man He speaks with humility because He converses in my <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.</q></p>

<p>On the same from the same book: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>As to the passage where we read that the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was crucified,  let us not suppose that He was crucified in His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But since He is both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as touching His Godhead <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as touching the assumption of the flesh, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Lord of Glory, is said to have been crucified. For He partakes of either nature&mdash; that is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and the divine. In the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of manhood He underwent the passion in order that He who suffered might be said to be without distinction both Lord of Glory and <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>. As it is written 'He that came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.'</q> </p>

<p>Similarly of the same: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>Let then vain questions about words be silent, as it is written, the kingdom of God is not in 'enticing words' but in 'demonstration of the spirit.'  For there is one <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> who speaks in both ways, since both natures exist in Him; but although He Himself speaks He does not speak always in the same way; for you see in Him at one time God's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, at another time man's feeling. As God He utters divine things, being the Word; as man He utters <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things, since in this nature He spoke.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his work on the Incarnation of the Lord against the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarians</a>: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>But while we are confuting these, another set spring up who assert the body of the Christ and His godhead to be of one nature. What <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> has vomited forth so terrible a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>? Really <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are more tolerable, whose infidelity, on account of these men, is strengthened, so that with greater opposition they deny Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to be of one substance, for they did at least endeavour to maintain the Godhead of the Lord and His flesh to be of one nature.</q></p>

<p>Of the same (from the same chapter):&mdash; </p>

<p><q>He has frequently told me that he maintains the exposition of the Nicene Council, but in that examination our Fathers laid down that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, not the flesh, was of one substance with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and they confessed that the Word came from the substance of the Father but that the flesh is of the Virgin. Why then do they hold out to us the name of the Nicene Council, while in reality they are introducing innovations of which our forefathers never entertained the thought?</q></p>

<p>Of the same against <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a>: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>Refuse thou to allow that the body is by nature on a par with the Godhead. Even though thou <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the body of the Christ to be real and bring it to the altar for transformation,  and fail to distinguish the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body and of the Godhead we shall say to you, 'If you offer rightly and fail to distinguish rightly, you sin, hold your peace.'  Distinguish what belongs naturally to us, and what is peculiar to the Word. For I had not what was naturally His, and He had not what was naturally mine, but He took what was naturally mine in order to make us partakers of what was His. And He received this not for confusion but for completion.</q></p>

<p>Of the same, a little further on: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>Let them who say that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Word has been changed into nature of the body say so no more, lest by the same interpretation the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Word seem to have been changed into the corruption of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For there is a distinction between what took, and what was taken. Power came over the Virgin, as in the words of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to her, 'The power of the highest shall overshadow you.'  But what was born was of the body of the Virgin, and on this account the descent  was divine but the conception <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the flesh and of the godhead could not be the same.</q> </p>

<p> <em>The testimony of St. Basil, Bishop of C&aelig;sarea.</em></p>

<p>From his homily on Thanksgiving:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Wherefore when He wept over His friend He showed His participation in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and set us free from two extremes, suffering us neither to grow over soft in suffering nor to be insensible to pain. As then the Lord suffered hunger after solid food had been digested, and thirst when the moisture in His body was exhausted; and was aweary when His nerves and sinews were strained by His journeying, it was not that His divinity was weighed down with toil, but that His body showed the wonted symptoms of its nature. Thus too when He allowed Himself to weep He permitted the flesh to take is natural course.</q></p>

<p>From the same against Eunomius:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>I say that being in the form of God has the same force as being in God's substance for as to have taken the form of a servant shows our Lord to have been of the substance of the manhood, so the statement that He was in the form of God attributes to Him the peculiar qualities of the divine substance.</q> </p>

<p> <em>The testimony of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Gregorius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nazianzus.</em></p>

<p>From his discourse De nova dominica: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>Believe that He will come again at His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> advent judging quick and dead,  no longer flesh but not without a body.</q></p>

<p><q>In order that He may be seen by them that pierced Him  and remain God without grossness.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his Epistle to Cledonius:&mdash; </p>

<p><q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man are two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, as <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body are two; but there are not two sons, nor yet are there here two men although <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> thus speaks of the outward man and the inward man.  In a word the sources of the Saviour's being are of two kinds, since the visible is distinct from the invisible and the timeless from that which is of time, but He is not two beings. God forbid.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same Exposition to Cledonius:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>If any one says that the flesh has now been laid aside, and that the Godhead is bare of body, and that it is not and will not come with that which was assumed, let him be deprived of the vision of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the advent! For where is the body now, save with Him that assumed it? For it assuredly has not been, as the Manichees fable, swallowed up by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that it may be honoured through dishonour; it has not been poured out and dissolved in the air like a voice and stream of perfume or flash of unsubstantial lightning. And where is the capacity of being handled after the resurrection, wherein one day it shall be seen by them that pierced Him? For Godhead of itself is invisible.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the second discourse about the Son:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>As the Word He was neither <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> nor disobedient, for these qualities belong to them that are in subjection and to inferiors; the former of the more tractable and the latter of them that deserve condemnation. But in the form of a servant He accommodates Himself to his fellowservants and puts on a form that was not His own, bearing in Himself all of me with all that is mine, that in Himself He may waste and destroy the baser parts as wax is wasted by fire or the mist of the earth by the sun.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his discourse on the Theophany:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Since He came forth from the Virgin with the assumption of two things mutually opposed to one another, flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, whereof the one was taken into God and the other exhibited the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Godhead.</q></p>

<p>Of the same a little further on:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>He was sent, but as Man. For His nature was twofold, for without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> He thenceforth was aweary and hungered and thirsted and suffered agony and shed tears after the custom of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his second discourse about the Son:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>He would be called God not of the Word, but of the visible creation, for how could He be God of Him that is absolutely God? Just so He is called Father, not of the visible creation, but of the Word. For He was of two-fold nature. Wherefore the one belongs absolutely to both, but the other not absolutely.  For He is absolutely our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not absolutely our Father. And it is this conjunction of names which gives rise to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. A <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this lies in the fact that when natures are distinguished in thought, there is a distinction in names. Listen to the words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. 'The God of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, The Father of Glory,' &mdash; of Christ He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> Father, and if both are one this is so not by nature but by conjunction. What can be plainer than this? Fifthly let it be said that He receives life, authority, inheritance of nations, power over all flesh, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> or what you will; all these belong to the manhood.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same work:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>'For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus.'  As man He still pleads for my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, because He keeps with Him the body which He took, till he made me God by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>&mdash; though He be no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> according to the flesh that is by affections of the flesh and though He be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same work:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Is it not plain to all that as God He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, He says, as man? If, that is, any one distinguish the apparent from that which is an object of intellectual perception. For what gives rise to this opinion is the fact that the appellation of the Son is absolute without relation, it not being added of whom He is the Son; so to give the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sense to this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> we hold it to belong to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and not to the divine.</q></p>

<p> <em>Testimony of the Holy Gregorius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nyssa.</em></p>

<p>From his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> discourse:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>And who says this that the infinity of the Godhead is comprehended by the limitation of the flesh, as by some vessel?</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same work:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>But if man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by necessity of its nature commingled with the body, is everywhere in authority, what need is there of asserting that the Godhead is limited by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the flesh?</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same work:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>What hinders us then, while recognising a certain unity and approximation of a divine nature in relation to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, from retaining the divine intelligence even in this approximation, believing that the divine even when it exists in men is beyond all limitation?</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his work against Eunomius:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>The Son of Mary converses with brothers, but the only begotten has no brothers, for how could the name of only begotten be preserved among brothers? And the same Christ that said 'God is a spirit'  says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> 'Handle me,'  to show that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> only can be handled and that the divine is intangible; and He that said 'I go'  indicates removal from place to place, while He that comprehends all things and 'by Whom,' as says the Apostle, 'all things were created and by Whom all things consist,'  had among all existing things nothing without and beyond Himself which can stand to Him in the relation of motion or removal.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same work:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>'Being by the right hand of God exalted.'  Who then was exalted? The lowly or the most high? And what is the lowly if it be not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>? And what is the most high save the divine? But God being most high needs no exaltation, and so the Apostle says that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> is exalted, exalted that is in being 'made both Lord and Christ.'  Therefore the Apostle does not mean by this term 'He made' the everlasting <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the Lord, but the change of the lowly to the exalted which took place on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By this word he declares the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, for when he says 'by the right hand of God exalted' he plainly reveals the ineffable &oelig;conomy of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> that the right hand of God which created all things, which is the Lord by whom all things were made and without whom nothing consists of things that were made,  through the union lifted up to Its own exaltation the manhood united to It.</q></p>

<p> <em>Testimony of St. Amphilochius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Iconium.</em></p>

<p>From his discourse on <q>My Father is greater than I</q>: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>Henceforth distinguish the natures; that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and that of man. For He was not made man by falling away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor God by increase and advance from man.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his discourse on <q>the Son can do nothing of Himself</q>: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>For after the resurrection the Lord shows both&mdash; both that the body is not of this nature, and that the body rises, for remember the history. After the passion and the resurrection the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were gathered together, and when the doors were shut the Lord stood in the midst of them. Never at any time before the passion did He do this. Could not then the Christ have done this even long before? For all things are possible to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  But before the passion He did not do so lest you should suppose the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> an unreality or appearance, and think of the flesh of the Christ as spiritual, or that it came down from heaven and is of another substance than our flesh. Some have invented all these theories with the idea that thereby they reverence the Lord, forgetful that through their thanksgiving they <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> themselves, and accuse the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>: for I say nothing of the lie being altogether absurd. For if He took another body how does that affect mine, which stands in need of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? If He brought down flesh from heaven, how does this affect my flesh which was derived from earth?</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same work:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Wherefore not before the passion, but after the passion, the Lord stood in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when the doors were shut, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your natural body after being sown is 'raised a spiritual body,'  and that you may not suppose the body that is raised to be a different body. When Thomas after the resurrection <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>, He shows him the prints of the nails, He shows him the marks of the spears. But had He not power to heal Himself after the resurrection too, when even before the resurrection He had healed all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? But by showing the prints of the nails He shows that it is this very body; by coming in when the doors were shut He shows that it has not the same qualities; the same body to fulfil the work of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> by raising that which had become a corpse, but a changed body that it fall not again under corruption nor be subject again to death.</q></p>

<p> <em>Testimony of the blessed Theophilus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria.</em></p>

<p>From his work against <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Our likeness which He assumed is not changed into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Godhead nor is His Godhead turned into our likeness. For He remains what He was from the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He so remains preserving our subsistence in Himself.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same treatise:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>But you persist continually in your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> attacking the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and using these words 'as the Son and the Father are one, so also are the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which the Son took and the Son Himself one.' You are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the Son and the Father are one on account of their one substance and the same Godhead; but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the Son are each of a different substance and different nature. For if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the Son and the Son Himself are one in the same sense in which the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are one, then the Father and the Soul will be one and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the Son shall one day say 'He that has seen Me has seen the Father.'  but this is not so; God forbid. For the Son and the Father are one because there is no distinction between their qualities, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the Son are distinguished alike in nature and substance, in that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is naturally of one substance with us was made by Him. For if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the Son are one in the same manner in which the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are one, as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> would have it, then the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> equally with the Son will be 'the brightness of God's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and express image of His person.'  But this is impossible; impossible that the Son and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be one as He and the Father are one. And what will <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> do when again he attacks himself? For he writes, never could the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> distressed and 'exceeding sorrowful'  be the '<a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> of every creature.'  For <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, as being stronger than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the Son Himself, says 'I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.'  If then the Son is stronger than His own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as is agreed, how can His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and in the form of God? For we say that 'He emptied Himself and took upon Him the form of a servant.'  In the extravagance of his impieties <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> surpasses all other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, as we have shown, for if the Word exists in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and is equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and if he supposes thus daring to write the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the Saviour to be in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how can the equal be greater, when the inferior in nature testifies to the superiority of what is beyond it?</q></p>

<p> <em>Testimony of the Holy John Chrysostom, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople.</em></p>

<p>From the Discourse held in the Great Church:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Your Lord exalted man to heaven, and you will not even give him a share of the agora. But why do I say 'to heaven'? He seated man on a kingly throne. Thou expellest him from the city.</q></p>

<p>Of the same, on the beginning of <a href="../bible/psa041.htm">Ps. xlii.</a>:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Up to this day <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> does not cease to say 'We are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us; we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.'  Nor did He stand here, but taking the first fruits of your nature He sat down 'above all principality and power and might, and every name that is named not only in this world but in the world to come.'  What could be equal to this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>? The first fruits of our race which has so much offended and is so dishonoured sits so high and enjoys <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> so vast.</q></p>

<p>Of the same about the division of tongues:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>For bethink you what it is to see our nature riding on the Cherubim and all the power of heaven mustered round about it. Consider too <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> wisdom and how many terms he searches for that he may set forth the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for he does not say simply the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, nor yet simply the riches, but the 'exceeding great riches of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in His kindness.'</q> </p>

<p>Of the same from his Dogmatic Oration, on the theme that the word spoken and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done in humility by Christ were not so spoken and done on account of infirmity, but on account of differences of dispensation:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>And after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, when He saw His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> disbelieving, He did not shrink from showing him both wound and print of nails, and letting him lay his hand upon the scars, and said 'Examine and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones.'  The reason of His not assuming the manhood of full age from the beginning, and of His deigning to be conceived, to be born, to be suckled, and to live so long upon the earth, was that by the long period of the time and all the other circumstances, He might give a warranty for this very thing.</q></p>

<p>Of the same against those who assert that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> rule <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Nothing was more worthless than man and than man nothing has become more precious. He was the last part of the reasonable creation, but the feet have been made the head, and through the firstfruits have been borne up to the kingly throne. Just as some man noble and bountiful, on seeing a wretch escaped from shipwreck who has saved nothing but his bare body from the waves, welcomes him with open hands, clothes him in a radiant robe, and exalts him to the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, so too has God done towards our nature. Man had lost all that he had, his freedom, his intercourse with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his abode in Paradise, his painless life, whence he came forth like a man all naked from a wreck, but God received him and straightway clothed him, and, taking him by the hand, led him onward step by step and brought him up to heaven.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same work:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>But God made the gain greater than the loss, and exalted our nature to the royal throne. So <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> exclaims 'And have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places'  at His right hand.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his third oration against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>He opened the heavens; of foes he made friends; He introduced them into heaven; He seated our nature on the right hand of the throne; He gave us countless other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his discourse on the Ascension:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>To this distance and height did He exalt our nature. Look where low it lay, and where it mounted up. Lower it was impossible to descend than where man descended; higher it was impossible to rise than where He exalted him.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his interpretation of the Epistle to the Ephesians:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>According to His good pleasure, which He had proposed in himself, that is which He earnestly desired, He was as it were in labour to tell us the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. And what is this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>? That He wishes to seat man on high; as in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came to pass.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same interpretation:&mdash; </p>

<p><q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> speaks of this and not of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same interpretation:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>'And when we were dead in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> He quickened us together in Christ.'  again Christ stands in the midst, and the work is wonderful. If the first fruits live we live also. He quickened both Him and us. Do you see that all these things are spoken according to the flesh?</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the gospel according to St. John:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Why does he add 'and dwelt among us'?  It is as though he said: Imagine nothing absurd from the phrase 'was made.' For I have not mentioned any change in that unchangeable nature, but of tabernacling  and of inhabiting. Now that which tabernacles is not identical with the tabernacle, but one thing tabernacles in another; otherwise there would be no tabernacling. Nothing inhabits itself. I spoke of a distinction of substance. For by the union and the conjunction <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> and the flesh are one without confusion or destruction of the substances, but by ineffable and indescribable union.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the gospel according to St. Matthew:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Just as one standing in the space between two that are separated from one another, stretches out both his hands and joins them, so too did He, joining the old and the new, the divine nature and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, His own with ours.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the Ascension of Christ:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>For so when two champions stand ready for the fight, some other intervening between them, at once stops the struggle, and puts an end to their ill will, so too did Christ. As God He was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, but we made light of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and turned away our faces from our loving Lord. Then Christ flung Himself in the midst, and restored both natures to mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and Himself took on Him the weight of the punishment laid by the Father on us.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same work:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Lo He brought the first fruits of our nature to the Father and the Father Himself approved the gift, alike on account of the high dignity of Him that bought it and of the faultlessness of the offering. He received it in His own hands, He made a chair of His own throne; nay more He seated it on His own right hand, let us then recognise who it was to whom it was said 'Sit on my right hand'  and what was that nature to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said 'Dust you are and to dust you shall return.'</q> </p>

<p>Of the same a little further on:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>What arguments to use, what words to utter I cannot tell; the nature which was rotten, worthless, declared lowest of all, vanquished everything and overcame the world. Today it has been thought worthy to be made higher than all, today it has received what from old time <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have desired; today it is possible for archangels to be made spectators of what has been for ages longed for, and they contemplate our nature, shining on the throne of the King in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</q></p>

<p>From the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to St. Luke:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>In all of us the Lord writes the express image of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and in various ways shows our nature the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Many and clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> does He give us both of His bodily advent and of His Godhead working by a body's means. For He wished to give us assurance of both His natures.</q></p>

<p>Of the same on the Theophany:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>'Who can express the noble acts of the Lord, or show forth all His praise?'  who could express in words the greatness of His goodness toward us? Human nature is joined to Godhead, while both natures remain independent.</q></p>

<p><q>Believe thou that this only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, on account of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, came down from heaven to earth, having taken on Him this manhood of like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> with us, and being born of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin and of <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. This <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> was effected, not in seeming and unreality, but in reality. He did not only pass through the Virgin, as through a channel, but was verily made flesh of her. Like us He really ate, and of the Virgin was really suckled. For if the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> was an unreality, then our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is a delusion. The Christ was twofold&mdash; the visible man, the invisible God. He ate as man, verily like ourselves, for the flesh that He wore was of like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> with us; He fed the five thousand with five loaves  as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><q>He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not Jesus the Christ as very God and as very man, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not in reality his own life, for we incur the same peril if we deny Christ Jesus or God the spirit, or the flesh of our own body. 'Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will I confess also before my Father which is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, but whosoever shall deny me before men him will I also deny before my Father which is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.'  These things spoke the Word made flesh; these things the man Christ Jesus, Lord of Glory, taught, being made Mediator for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the very <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> whereby He mediated between God and men. Both being made one out of the natures united for this very purpose, He was one and the same through either nature, but so that in both He fell short in neither, lest haply by being born as man He should cease to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or by remaining God should not be man. Therefore this is the blessedness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to preach both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to confess both word and flesh, to recognise that God was also man, and not to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the flesh is also Word.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from the same book: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>So the only begotten God being born man of a Virgin and in the fullness of the time, being Himself ordained to work out the advance of man to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, observed this order of things, through all the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>, that He might teach belief in Himself, as <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and keep us in mind to preach Him as <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>. As being man He always spoke and acted as is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but in such a manner as never to speak in this same mode of speech as touching both save with the intention of signifying both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>. But hence the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> derive a pretext for catching in their traps simple and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men: what was spoken by our Lord in accordance with His manhood they <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> assert to have been uttered in the weakness of His divine nature, and since one and the same person spoke all the words He used they urged that all He uttered He uttered about Himself. Now even we do not deny that all His extant words are of His own nature. But granted that the one Christ is man and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; granted that when man He was not then first <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; granted that when man He was then also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, granted that after the assumption of the manhood in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, the Word was man and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows of necessity that there is one and the same <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His words as there is of His generation. Whenever in Him, as occasion may require, you distinguish the manhood from the Godhead, then also endeavour to separate the words of God from the words of man. And whenever you confess <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, then discern the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And when the words are spoken of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and again of man wholly and wholly of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, consider carefully the occasion. If anything was spoken to signify what was appropriate to a particular occasion, apply the words to the occasion. A distinction must be observed between God before the manhood, man and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, man wholly and God wholly after the union of the manhood and Godhead. Take heed therefore not to confuse the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> in the words and acts. For it must needs be that according to the quality of the kinds of natures a distinction lies in the manner of speech, before the manhood was born, in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> when it was still approaching death, and again when it was everlasting. 'For if in His birth and in His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> and in His death He acted in accordance with our nature He nevertheless effected all this by the power of His own nature.'</q></p>

<p>Of the same in the same book:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Do you then see that thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are confessed, so that death is predicated of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the resurrection of the flesh, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for consider the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the power of the resurrection, and recognise in the death the &oelig;conomy as touching man. And since both death and resurrection have been brought about in their own natures, bear in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, I beg you, the one Christ Jesus, who was of both. I have shortly demonstrated these points to you to the end that we may remember both natures to have been in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> 'for being in the form of God He took the form of a servant.'</q> </p>

<p> <em>Testimony of the very <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Augustinus.</em></p>

<p>From his letter to Volusianus. Epistle III:</p>

<p><q>But now He appeared as Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so as in the unity of His person to conjoin both natures, by combining the wonted with the unwonted, and the unwonted with the wonted.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his exposition of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>What then, O <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>? Since Christ is also man, He speaks as man; and do you <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> God? He in Himself lifts man's nature on high, and you have the hardihood to cheapen His divine nature.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his book on the Exposition at the Faith:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>It is ours to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but His to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and so let God the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself, after receiving all that is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, be man, and let man after His assumption and reception of all that is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be no other than God. It must not be supposed because He is said to have been incarnate and mixed that therefore His substance was diminished. God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that He mixes Himself without the natural corruption, and He is mixed in reality. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also that He so received in Himself as that no addition of increment accrues to Himself, as also He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> He infused His whole self so as to incur no diminution. Let us not then, in accordance with our weak intelligence, and forming conjectures on the teaching of experience and the senses, suppose that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are mixed after the manner of things created and equal mixed together, and that from such a confusion as this of the Word and of the flesh a body as it were was made. God forbid that this should be our belief, lest we should suppose that after the manner of things which are confounded together two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> were brought into one hypostasis.  For a mention of this kind implies destruction of both parts; but Christ Himself, containing but not contained, who examines us but is Himself beyond examination, making full but not made full, everywhere at one and the same time being Himself whole and pervading the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, through His pouring out His own power, as being moved with mercy, was mingled with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, though the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man was not mingled with the divine.</q></p>

<p> <em>Testimony of Severianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Gabala.</em> </p>

<p>From <q>the Nativity of Christ</q>:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>O <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> heavenly and yet on earth&mdash; <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> seen and not apparent for so was the Christ after His birth; heavenly and yet on earth; holding and not held; seen and invisible; of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> as touching the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Godhead, on earth as touching the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the manhood; seen in the flesh, invisible in the spirit; held as to the body not to be holden as to the Word.</q></p>

<p> <em>Testimony of Atticus</em>,  <em><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople.</em></p>

<p>From his letter to Eupsychius:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>How then did it behoove the Most Wise to act? By mediation of the flesh assumed, and by union of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> with man born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, He is made of either nature, so that the Christ made one of both, as constituted in Godhead, abides in the proper dignity of His impassible nature, but in flesh, being brought near to death, at one and the same time shows the kindred nature of the flesh how through death to despise death, and by His death confirms the righteousness of the new covenant.</q></p>

<p> <em>Testimony of Cyril, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria.</em></p>

<p>From his letter to <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>The natures which have been brought together in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> unity are distinct, and of both there is one God and Son, but the difference of the natures has not been removed in consequence of the union.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his letter against the Orientals: &mdash; </p>

<p><q>There is an union of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, wherefore we acknowledge one Christ, one Son, one Lord. In accordance with this perception of the unconfounded union we acknowledge the Holy Virgin as <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>  because the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was made flesh and was made man, and from the very conception united to Himself the temper taken from her.</q> </p>

<p>Of the same:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>There is one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, even if the difference be recognised of the natures of which we assert the ineffable union to have been made.</q></p>

<p>Of the same:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Therefore, as I said, while praising the manner of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, we see that two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> came together in inseparable union without confusion and without division,  for the flesh is flesh and no kind of Godhead, although it was made flesh of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; in like manner the Word is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not flesh, although He made the flesh His own according to the &oelig;conomy.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his interpretation of the Epistle to the Hebrews:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>For although the natures which came together in unity are regarded as different and unequal with one another, I mean of flesh and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Who was made of both, is one.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his interpretation of the same Epistle:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Yet though the only begotten <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is said to be united in hypostasis to flesh, we deny there was any confusion of the natures with one another, and declare each to remain what it is.</q></p>

<p>Of the same from his commentaries:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>The Father's Word, born of the Virgin, is named man, though being by nature God as partaking of flesh and blood like us  for thus He was seen by men upon earth, without getting rid of His own nature, but assuming our Manhood perfect according to its own reason.</q></p>

<p>Of the same concerning the Incarnation (Schol. c. 13):&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Then before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> there is one Very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in manhood He remains what He was and is and will be; the one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> then must not be separated into man apart and into God apart, but recognising the difference of the natures and preserving them unconfounded with one another, we assert that there is one and the same Christ Jesus.</q></p>

<p>Of the same after other commentaries:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>There is plain perception of one thing dwelling in another, namely the divine nature in manhood, without undergoing commixture or any confusion, or any change into what it was not. For what is said to dwell in another does not become the same as that in which it dwells, but is rather regarded as one thing in another. But in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Word and of the manhood the difference points out to us a difference of natures alone, for of both is perceived one Christ. Therefore he says that the Word 'Tabernacled among us,'  carefully observing the freedom from confusion, for he recognises one only begotten Son who was made flesh and became man.</q></p>

<p>Now, my dear sir, you have heard the great lights of the world; you have seen the beams of their teaching, and you have received exact instruction how, not only after the nativity, but after the passion which wrought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and the resurrection, and the ascension, they have shown the union of the Godhead and of the manhood to be without confusion.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; I did not suppose that they distinguished the natures after the union, but I have found an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> amount of distinction.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; It is mad and rash against those noble champions of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> so much as to wag your tongue. But I will adduce for you the words of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a>, in order that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he too asserts the union to be without confusion. Now hear his words.</p>

<p> <em>Testimony of Apollinarius.</em></p>

<p>From his summary:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>There is an union between what is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and what is of the body. On the one side is the adorable Creator Who is wisdom and power <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; these are of the Godhead.  On the other hand is the Son of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, born at the last time, worshipping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, advancing in wisdom, strengthened in power; these are of the body. The suffering on behalf of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the curse came and will not pass away nor yet be changed into the incorporeal.</q></p>

<p>And again a little further on:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Men are consubstantial with the unreasoning animals as far as the unreasoning body is concerned; they are of another substance in so far forth as they are reasonable. Just so God who is consubstantial with men according to the flesh is of another substance in so far forth as He is Word and Man.</q></p>

<p>And in another place he says:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Of things which are mingled together the qualities are mixed and not destroyed. Thus it comes to pass that some are separate from the mixed parts as wine from water, nor yet is there mingling with a body, nor yet as of bodies with bodies, but the mingling preserves also the unmixed, so that, as each occasion may require, the energy of the Godhead either acts independently or in conjunction, as was the case when the Lord fasted, for the Godhead being in conjunction in proportion to its being above need, hunger was hindered, but when it no longer opposed to the craving its superiority to need, then hunger arose, to the undoing of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But if the mixture of the bodies suffered no change, how much more that of the Godhead?</q></p>

<p>And in another place he says:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>If the mixture with iron which makes the iron itself fire does not change its nature, so too the union of God with the body implies no change of the body, even though the body extend its divine energies to what is within its reach.</q></p>

<p>To this he immediately adds:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>If a man has both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and these remain in unity, much more does the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, who has Godhead and body, keep both secure and unconfounded.</q></p>

<p>And again a little further on:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is partaker of the divine energy, as far as it is capable, but it is as distinct as the least from the greatest. Man is a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not servant of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor even of Himself. Man is a creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a creature of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor even of Himself.</q></p>

<p>And again:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>If any one takes in reference to Godhead and not in reference to flesh the passage the 'Son does what He sees the Father do,'  wherein He Who was made flesh is distinct from the Father Who was not made flesh, divides two divine energies. But there is no division. So He does not speak in reference to Godhead.</q></p>

<p>Again he says:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>As man is not an unreasoning being, on account of the contact of the reasoning and the unreasoning, just so the Saviour is not a creature on account of the contact of the creature with God uncreate.</q></p>

<p>To this he also adds:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>The invisible which is united to a visible body and thereby is beheld, remains invisible, and it remains without composition because it is not circumscribed with the body, and the body, remaining in its own measure, accepts the union with God in accordance with its being quickened, nor is it that which is quickened which quickens.</q></p>

<p>And a little further on he says:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>If the mixture with <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, although from the beginning they coalesce, does not make the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> visible on account of the body, nor change it into the other properties of the body, so as to allow of its being cut or lessened, how much rather <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is not of the same nature as the body, is united to the body without undergoing change, if the body of man remains in its own nature, and this when it is animated by a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, then in the case of Christ the commingling does not so change the body as that it is not a body.</q></p>

<p>And further on he says again:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>He who confesses that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body are constituted one by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, is inconsistent with himself when he asserts that this union of the Word with the body is a change, such change being not even beheld in the case of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q></p>

<p>Listen to him again exclaiming clearly:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>If they are impious who deny that the flesh of the Lord abides, much more are they who refuse wholly to accept His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>.</q></p>

<p>And in his little book about the Incarnation he has written:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>The words 'Sit on my right hand'  He speaks as to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for they are not spoken to Him that sits ever on the throne of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> after His ascension from earth, but they are said to Him who has now been exalted to the heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as man, as the Apostles say 'for David is not ascended into the heavens, but he says himself the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand.'  The order is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, giving a beginning to the sitting; but it is a divine dignity to sit together with God 'to whom thousand thousands minister and before whom ten thousand times ten thousand stand.'</q> </p>

<p>And again a little further on:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>He does not put His enemies under Him as God but as man, but so that the God who is seen and man are the same. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> too teaches us that the words 'until I make your foes your footstool'  are spoken to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, describing the success as His own of course in accordance with His divinity 'According to the working whereby He is able even to subdue all things unto Himself.'  Behold Godhead and manhood existing inseparably in One Person.</q></p>

<p>And again:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>'Glorify me with your own self with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had with you before the world was.'  The word 'glorify' He uses as man, but His having this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> before the ages He reveals as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>And again:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>But let us not be humiliated as thinking the worship of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> humiliation, even in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> likeness, but as though honouring some king appearing in poor raiment with his royal <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and above all seeing that the very garb in which He is clad is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, as became the body of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the world's Saviour which is seed of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, instrument of divine <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, destroyer of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, slayer of death and prince of resurrection; for though it had its nature from man it derived its life from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and its power and divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from heaven.</q></p>

<p>And again:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Whence we worship the body as the Word; we partake of the body as of the spirit.</q></p>

<p>Now it has been plainly shown you that the author who was first to introduce the mixture of the natures openly uses the argument of a distinction between them; thus he has called the body garb, creature and instrument; he even went so far as to call it slave, which none of us has ever ventured to do. He also says that it was deemed worthy of the seat on the right hand, and uses many other expressions which are rejected by your vain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; But why then did he who was the first to introduce the mixture insert so great a distinction in his arguments?</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The power of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> forces even them that vehemently fight against her to agree with what she says, but, if you will, let us now begin a discussion about the impassibility of the Lord.</p>

<p> <em>Eran.</em>&mdash; You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that musicians are accustomed to give their strings rest, and they slacken them by turning the pegs; if then things altogether void of reason and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> stand in need of some recreation, we who partake of both shall do nothing absurd if we mete out our labour in proportion to our power. Let us then put it off till tomorrow.</p>

<p> <em>Orth.</em>&mdash; The divine David charges us to give heed to the divine oracles by night and by day; but let it be as you say, and let us keep the investigation of the remainder of our subject till tomorrow.</p>
