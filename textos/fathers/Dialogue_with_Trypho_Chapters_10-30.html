<h1>Dialogue with Trypho (Chapters 10-30)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 10. Trypho blames the Christians for this alone&mdash;the non-observance of the law</h2>

<p>And when they ceased, I again addressed them.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Is there any other matter, my friends, in which we are blamed, than this, that we live not after the law, and are not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in the flesh as your forefathers were, and do not observe sabbaths as you do? Are our lives and customs also <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> among you? And I ask this: have you also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> concerning us, that we eat men; and that after the feast, having extinguished the lights, we engage in promiscuous concubinage? Or do you condemn us in this alone, that we adhere to such tenets, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in an opinion, untrue, as you think?</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> This is what we are amazed at, but those things about which the multitude speak are not worthy of belief; for they are most repugnant to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Moreover, I am aware that your precepts in the so-called <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> are so wonderful and so great, that I suspect no one can keep them; for I have carefully read them. But this is what we are most at a loss about: that you, professing to be <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and supposing yourselves better than others, are not in any particular separated from them, and do not alter your mode of living from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, in that you observe no festivals or sabbaths, and do not have the rite of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; and further, resting your hopes on a man that was crucified, you yet expect to obtain some good thing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while you do not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> His commandments. Have you not read, that that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be cut off from his people who shall not have been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> on the eighth day? And this has been ordained for strangers and for slaves equally. But you, despising this covenant rashly, reject the consequent duties, and attempt to persuade yourselves that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when, however, you perform none of those things which they do who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God. If, therefore, you can defend yourself on these points, and make it manifest in what way you hope for anything whatsoever, even though you do not observe the law, this we would very gladly hear from you, and we shall make other similar investigations.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 11. The law abrogated; the New Testament promised and given by God</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> There will be no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, O Trypho, nor was there from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> any other existing, but He who made and disposed all this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Nor do we think that there is one God for us, another for you, but that He alone is God who led your fathers out from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with a strong hand and a high arm. Nor have we trusted in any other (for there is no other), but in Him in whom you also have trusted, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. But we do not trust through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> or through the law; for then we would do the same as yourselves. But now &mdash;(for I have read that there shall be a final law, and a covenant, the chiefest  of all, which it is now incumbent on all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to observe, as many as are seeking after the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the law promulgated on Horeb is now old, and belongs to yourselves alone; but <em>this</em> is for all universally. Now, law placed against law has abrogated that which is before it, and a covenant which comes after in like manner has put an end to the previous one; and an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and final law&mdash;namely, Christ&mdash;has been given to us, and the covenant is trustworthy, after which there shall be no law, no commandment, no ordinance. Have you not read this which Isaiah says: 'Hearken unto Me, hearken unto Me, my people; and, you kings, give ear unto Me: for a law shall go forth from Me, and My judgment shall be for a light to the nations. My righteousness approaches swiftly, and My <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> shall go forth, and nations shall trust in My arm?'  And by Jeremiah, concerning this same new covenant, He thus speaks: 'Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and with the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a>; not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>' <span class="stiki" id="note011970"><a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse31">Jeremiah&nbsp;31:31-32</a></span>). If, therefore, God proclaimed a new covenant which was to be instituted, and this for a light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, we see and are persuaded that men approach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, leaving their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and other unrighteousness, through the name of Him who was crucified, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and abide by their confession even unto death, and maintain <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Moreover, by the works and by the attendant <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, it is possible for all to understand that He is the new law, and the new covenant, and the expectation of those who out of every people wait for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> spiritual <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and descendants of Judah, Jacob, Isaac, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> (who in uncircumcision was approved of and blessed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on account of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and called the father of many nations), are we who have been led to God through this crucified Christ, as shall be demonstrated while we proceed.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 12. The Jews violate the eternal law, and interpret ill that of Moses</h2>

<p>I also adduced another passage in which Isaiah exclaims: <q>Hear My words, and your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given Him for a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the people: nations which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not You shall call on You; peoples who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not You shall escape to You, because of your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; for He has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> You.</q> </p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> This same law you have despised, and His new <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> covenant you have slighted; and now you neither receive it, nor repent of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>. <q>For your ears are closed, your eyes are blinded, and the heart is hardened,</q> Jeremiah  has cried; yet not even then do you listen. The Lawgiver is present, yet you do not see Him; to the poor the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is preached, the blind see, yet you do not understand. You have now need of a second <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, though you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> greatly in the flesh. The new law requires you to keep perpetual <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, and you, because you are idle for one day, suppose you are <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, not discerning why this has been commanded you: and if you eat unleavened bread, you say the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has been fulfilled. The Lord our God does not take pleasure in such observances: if there is any <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjured</a> person or a thief among you, let him cease to be so; if any adulterer, let him repent; then he has kept the sweet and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sabbaths of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If any one has impure hands, let him wash and be pure.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 13. Isaiah teaches that sins are forgiven through Christ's blood</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For Isaiah did not send you to a bath, there to wash away <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which not even all the water of the sea were sufficient to purge; but, as might have been expected, this was that saving bath of the olden time which followed  those who repented, and who no longer were purified by the blood of goats and of sheep, or by the ashes of an heifer, or by the offerings of fine flour, but by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> through the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and through His death, who died for this very reason, as Isaiah himself said, when he spoke thus:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>The Lord shall make bare His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> arm in the eyes of all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and all the nations and the ends of the earth shall see the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Depart, depart, depart,  go out from thence, and touch no unclean thing; go out of the midst of her, be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord, for  you go not with haste. For the Lord shall go before you; and the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, shall gather you together. Behold, my servant shall deal prudently; and He shall be exalted, and be greatly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. As many were astonished at You, so Your form and Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall be marred more than men. So shall many nations be astonished at Him, and the kings shall shut their mouths; for that which had not been told them concerning Him shall they see, and that which they had not heard shall they consider. Lord,  who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have announced Him as a child before Him, as a root in a dry ground. He has no form or comeliness, and when we saw Him He had no form or beauty; but His form is dishonoured, and fails more than the sons of men. He is a man in affliction, and acquainted with bearing sickness, because His face has been turned away; He was despised, and we esteemed Him not. He bears our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and is distressed for us; and we esteemed Him to be in toil and in affliction, and in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> treatment. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him. With His stripes we are healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray. Every man has turned to his own way; and the Lord laid on Him our iniquities, and by reason of His oppression He opens not His mouth. He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He opens not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away. And who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth. Because of the transgressions of my people He came unto death. And I will give the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> for His grave, and the rich for His death, because He committed no iniquity, and deceit was not found in His mouth. And the Lord wills to purify Him from affliction. If he has been given for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall see a long-lived seed. And the Lord wills to take His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> away from trouble, to show Him light, and to form Him in understanding, to justify the righteous One who serves many well. And He shall bear our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; therefore He shall inherit many, and shall divide the spoil of the strong, because His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was delivered to death; and He was numbered with the transgressors, and He bore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of many, and was delivered for their transgression. Sing, O barren, who bearest not; break forth and cry aloud, you who does not travail in pain: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife. For the Lord said, Enlarge the place of your tent and of your curtains; fix them, spare not, lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes; stretch forth to your right and your left; and your seed shall inherit the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and you shall make the desolate cities to be inherited. Fear not because you are ashamed, neither be confounded because you have been reproached; for you shall forget everlasting shame, and shall not remember the reproach of your widowhood, because the Lord has made a name for Himself, and He who has redeemed you shall be called through the whole earth the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. The Lord has called you as  a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> forsaken and grieved in spirit, as  a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> from her youth.' </em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 14. Righteousness is not placed in Jewish rites, but in the conversion of the heart given in baptism by Christ</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Justin:</strong> By reason, therefore, of this laver of repentance and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which has been ordained on account of the transgression of God's people, as Isaiah cries, we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and testify that that very <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which he announced is alone able to purify those who have repented; and this is the water of life. But the cisterns which you have dug for yourselves are broken and profitless to you. For what is the use of that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which cleanses the flesh and body alone? Baptize the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; and, lo! The body is pure. For this is the symbolic significance of unleavened bread, that you do not commit the old <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> leaven. But you have understood all things in a carnal sense, and you suppose it to be <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> if you do such things, while your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are filled with deceit, and, in short, with every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Accordingly, also, after the seven days of eating unleavened bread, God commanded them to mingle new leaven, that is, the performance of other works, and not the imitation of the old and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works. And because this is what this new Lawgiver demands of you, I shall again refer to the words which have been quoted by me, and to others also which have been passed over. They are related by Isaiah to the following effect:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>Hearken to me, and your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall live; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given Him for a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the people, a leader and commander to the nations. Nations which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not You shall call on You; and peoples who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not You shall escape unto You, because of Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, for He has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> You. Seek <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and when you find Him, call on Him, so long as He may be near you. Let the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will obtain mercy, because He will abundantly pardon your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For my thoughts are not as your thoughts, neither are my ways as your ways; but as far removed as the heavens are from the earth, so far is my way removed from your way, and your thoughts from my thoughts. For as the snow or the rain descends from heaven, and shall not return till it waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread for food, so shall My word be that goes forth out of My mouth: it shall not return until it shall have  accomplished all that I desired, and I shall make My commandments prosperous. For you shall go out with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and be taught with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. For the mountains and the hills shall leap while they expect you, and all the trees of the fields shall applaud with their branches: and instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle. And the Lord shall be for a name, and for an everlasting sign, and He shall not fail! </em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Of these and such like words written by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, O Trypho, some have reference to the first advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in which He is preached as inglorious, obscure, and of mortal appearance: but others had reference to His second advent, when He shall appear in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and above the clouds; and your nation shall see and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him whom they have pierced, as Hosea, one of the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and Daniel, foretold.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 15. In what the true fasting consists</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Learn, therefore, to keep the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fast of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as Isaiah says, that you may please God. Isaiah has cried thus:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>Shout vehemently, and do not spare: lift up your voice as with a trumpet, and show My people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. They seek Me from day to day, and desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> My ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They ask of Me now righteous judgment, and desire to draw near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, Wherefore have we fasted, and You see not? And afflicted our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and You have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>? Because in the days of your <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> you find your own pleasure, and oppress all those who are subject to you. Behold, you fast for strifes and debates, and smite the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> with your fists. Why do you fast for Me, as today, so that your voice is heard aloud? This is not the fast which I have chosen, the day in which a man shall afflict his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And not even if you bend your neck like a ring, or clothe yourself in sackcloth and ashes, shall you call this a fast, and a day acceptable to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. This is not the fast which I have chosen, says the Lord; but loose every unrighteous bond, dissolve the terms of wrongous covenants, let the oppressed go free, and avoid every iniquitous contract. Deal your bread to the hungry, and lead the homeless poor under your dwelling; if you see the naked, clothe him; and do not hide yourself from your own flesh. Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your garments  shall rise up quickly: and your righteousness shall go before you, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God shall envelope you. Then shall you cry, and the Lord shall hear you: while you are speaking, He will say, Behold, I am here. And if you take away from you the yoke, and the stretching out of the hand, and the word of murmuring; and shall give heartily your bread to the hungry, and shall satisfy the afflicted <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; then shall your light arise in the darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noon-day: and your God shall be with you continually, and you shall be satisfied according as your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> desires, and your bones shall become fat, and shall be as a watered garden, and as a fountain of water, or as a land where water fails not. <span class="stiki" id="note011981"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;58:1-12</a></span></em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><q>Circumcise, therefore, the foreskin of your heart,</q> as the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all these passages demand.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 16. Circumcision given as a sign, that the Jews might be driven away for their evil deeds done to Christ and the Christians</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And God himself proclaimed by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, speaking thus: 'And circumcise the hardness of your hearts, and no longer stiffen the neck. For the Lord your God is both Lord of lords, and a great, mighty, and terrible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who regards not <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and takes not rewards.'  And in Leviticus: 'Because they have transgressed against Me, and despised Me, and because they have walked contrary to Me, I also walked contrary to them, and I shall cut them off in the land of their enemies.

<h2>Chapter 17. The Jews sent persons through the whole earth to spread calumnies on Christians</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For other nations have not inflicted on us and on Christ this wrong to such an extent as you have, who in very deed are the authors of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> prejudice against the Just One, and us who hold by Him. For after that you had crucified Him, the only blameless and righteous Man&mdash;through whose stripes those who approach the Father by Him are healed&mdash;when you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He had risen from the dead and ascended to heaven, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold He would, you not only did not repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> which you had committed, but at that time you selected and sent out from Jerusalem chosen men through all the land to tell that the godless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had sprung up, and to publish those things which all they who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> us not speak against us. So that you are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> not only of your own unrighteousness, but in fact of that of all other men. And Isaiah cries <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>: 'By reason of you, My name is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note011986"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;52:5</a></span> And: 'Woe unto their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>!

<h2>Chapter 18. Christians would observe the law, if they did not know why it was instituted</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For since you have read, O Trypho, as you yourself admitted, the doctrines taught by our Saviour, I do not think that I have done foolishly in adding some short utterances of His to the prophetic statements. Wash therefore, and be now clean, and put away iniquity from your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as God bids you be washed in this laver, and be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. For we too would observe the fleshly <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, and in short all the feasts, if we did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for what reason they were enjoined you&mdash;namely, on account of your transgressions and the hardness of your hearts. For if we patiently endure all things contrived against us by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, so that even amid cruelties unutterable, death and torments, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for mercy to those who inflict such things upon us, and do not wish to give the least retort to any one, even as the new Lawgiver commanded us: how is it, Trypho, that we would not observe those <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> which do not harm us&mdash;I speak of fleshly <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, and feasts?</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 19. Circumcision unknown before Abraham. The law was given by Moses on account of the hardness of their hearts</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> It is this about which we are at a loss, and with reason, because, while you endure such things, you do not observe all the other customs which we are now discussing.</p>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is not, however, necessary for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but for you alone, in order that, as I have already said, you may suffer these things which you now <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> suffer. Nor do we receive that useless <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of cisterns, for it has nothing to do with this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of life. Wherefore also God has announced that you have forsaken Him, the living fountain, and dug for yourselves broken cisterns which can hold no water. Even you, who are the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> according to the flesh, have need of our <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; but we, having the latter, do not require the former. For if it were necessary, as you suppose, God  would not have made Adam uncircumcised; would not have had respect to the gifts of Abel when, being uncircumcised, he offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and would not have been pleased with the uncircumcision of <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, who was not found, because God had translated him. <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, being uncircumcised, was saved from <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves and the Lord sending him out. <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> was the beginning of our race; yet, uncircumcised, along with his children he went into the ark. <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Most High, was uncircumcised; to whom also <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> the first who received <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> after the flesh, gave <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and he blessed him: after whose order God declared, by the mouth of David, that He would establish the everlasting <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Therefore to you alone this <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was necessary, in order that the people may be no people, and the nation no nation; as also Hosea,  one of the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, declares. Moreover, all those righteous men already mentioned, though they kept no <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>,  were pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and after them <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> with all his descendants until <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, under whom your nation appeared unrighteous and ungrateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, making a calf in the wilderness: wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, accommodating Himself to that nation, enjoined them also to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, as if to His name, in order that you might not serve <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. Which precept, however, you have not observed; nay, you <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> your children to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. And you were commanded to keep <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, that you might retain the memorial of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For His word makes this announcement, saying, 'That you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am God who redeemed you.' <span class="stiki" id="note011993"><a href="../bible/eze020.htm#verse12">Ezekiel&nbsp;20:12</a></span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 20. Why choice of meats was prescribed</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Moreover, you were commanded to abstain from certain kinds of food, in order that you might keep God before your eyes while you ate and drank, seeing that you were prone and very ready to depart from His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also affirms: 'The people ate and drank, and rose up to play.' <span class="stiki" id="note011994"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;32:6</a></span> And again: 'Jacob ate, and was satisfied, and grew fat; and he who was beloved kicked: he grew fat, he grew thick, he was enlarged, and he forsook God who had made him.' <span class="stiki" id="note011995"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:15</a></span> For it was told you by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the book of Genesis, that God granted to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, being a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, to eat of every animal, but not of flesh with the blood, which is <em>dead</em>. </p></blockquote>

<p>And as he was ready to say, <q>as the green herbs,</q> I anticipated him:</p>

<blockquote><p>Why do you not receive this statement, 'as the green herbs,' in the sense in which it was given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to wit, that just as God has granted the herbs for sustenance to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even so has He given the animals for the diet of flesh? But, you say, a distinction was laid down thereafter to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, because we do not eat certain herbs. As you interpret it, the thing is incredible. And first I shall not occupy myself with this, though able to say and to hold that every vegetable is food, and fit to be eaten. But although we discriminate between green herbs, not eating all, we refrain from eating some, not because they are common or unclean, but because they are bitter, or deadly, or thorny. But we lay hands on and take of all herbs which are sweet, very nourishing and good, whether they are marine or land plants. Thus also God by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commanded you to abstain from unclean and improper  and violent animals: when, moreover, though you were eating manna in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and were seeing all those wondrous acts wrought for you by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you made and worshipped the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">golden calf</a>.  Hence he cries continually, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, 'They are foolish children, in whom is no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note011999"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:6,&nbsp;20</a></span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 21. Sabbaths were instituted on account of the people's sins, and not for a work of righteousness</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Moreover, that God enjoined you to keep the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and impose on you other precepts for a sign, as I have already said, on account of your unrighteousness, and that of your fathers&mdash;as He declares that for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, lest His name be profaned among them, therefore He permitted some of you to remain alive&mdash;these words of His can prove to you: they are narrated by Ezekiel thus:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>I am the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; walk in My statutes, and keep My judgments, and take no part in the customs of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and hallow My <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the Lord your God. Notwithstanding you rebelled against Me, and your children walked not in My statutes, neither kept My judgments to do them: which if a man do, he shall live in them. But they polluted My <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>. And I said that I would pour out My fury upon them in the wilderness, to accomplish My <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> upon them; yet I did it not; that My name might not be altogether profaned in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. I led them out before their eyes, and  I lifted up Mine hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and disperse them through the countries; because they had not executed My judgments, but had despised My statutes, and polluted My <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, and their eyes were after the devices of their fathers. Wherefore I gave them also statutes which were not good, and judgments whereby they shall not live. And I shall pollute them in their own gifts, that I may destroy all that opens the womb, when I pass through them. <span class="stiki" id="note012000"><a href="../bible/eze020.htm#verse19">Ezekiel&nbsp;20:19-26</a></span></em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 22. So also were sacrifices and oblations</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And that you may learn that it was for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of your own nation, and for their idolatries and not because there was any necessity for such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, that they were likewise enjoined, listen to the manner in which He speaks of these by Amos, one of the twelve, saying: 'Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord! To what end is this day of the Lord for you? It is darkness and not light, as when a man flees from the face of a lion, and a bear meets him; and he goes into his house, and leans his hands against the wall, and the serpent bites him. Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness and not light, even very dark, and no brightness in it? I have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, I have despised your feast-days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies: wherefore, though you offer Me your burnt-offerings and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your presence. Take away from Me the multitude of your songs and psalms; I will not hear your instruments. But let judgment be rolled down as water, and righteousness as an impassable torrent. Have you offered unto Me victims and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in the wilderness, O house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? Says the Lord. And have you taken up the tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Moloch</a>, and the star of your god Raphan, the figures which you made for yourselves? And I will carry you away beyond Damascus, says the Lord, whose name is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>. Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: those who are named among the chiefs have plucked away the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the nations: the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> have entered for themselves. Pass all of you unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go unto Hamath the great, and go down thence to Gath of the strangers, the noblest of all these kingdoms, if their boundaries are greater than your boundaries. You who come to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> day, who are approaching, and who hold to false <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>; who lie on beds of ivory, and are at ease upon their couches; who eat the lambs out of the flock, and the sucking calves out of the midst of the herd; who applaud at the sound of the musical instruments; they reckon them as stable, and not as fleeting, who drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments, but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph. Wherefore now they shall be captives, among the first of the nobles who are carried away; and the house of evil-doers shall be removed, and the neighing of horses shall be taken away from Ephraim.'  And again by Jeremiah: 'Collect your flesh, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and eat: for concerning neither <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> nor libations did I command your fathers in the day in which I took them by the hand to lead them out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.'  And again by David, in the forty-ninth Psalm, He thus said: 'The God of gods, the Lord has spoken, and called the earth, from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. Out of Zion is the perfection of His beauty. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall come openly, and shall not keep silence. Fire shall burn before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. He shall call to the heavens above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people. Assemble to Him His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; those that have made a covenant with Him by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. And the heavens shall declare His righteousness, for God is judge. Hear, O My people, and I will speak to you; O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and I will testify to you, I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even your God. I will not reprove you for your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; your burnt-offerings are continually before me. I will take no bullocks out of your house, nor he-goats out of your folds: for all the beasts of the field are Mine, the herds and the oxen on the mountains. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the fowls of the heavens, and the beauty of the field is Mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer unto God the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise, and pay your vows unto the Most High, and call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me. But unto the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> God says, What have you to do to declare My statutes, and to take My covenant into your mouth? But you have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> instruction, and cast My words behind you. When you saw a thief, you consented with him; and hast been partaker with the adulterer. Your mouth has framed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and your tongue has enfolded deceit. You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son. These things have you done, and I kept silence; you thought that I would be like yourself in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. I will reprove you, and set your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in order before your eyes. Now consider this, you that forget <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest He tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. The  <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise shall glorify Me; and there is the way in which I shall show him My <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.'  Accordingly He neither takes <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> from you nor commanded them at first to be offered because they are needful to Him, but because of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For indeed the temple, which is called the temple in Jerusalem, He admitted to be His house or court, not as though He needed it, but in order that you, in this view of it, giving yourselves to Him, might not worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. And that this is so, Isaiah says: 'What house have you built Me? Says the Lord. <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is My throne, and earth is My footstool.' <span class="stiki" id="note012004"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;66:1</a></span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 23. The opinion of the Jews regarding the law does an injury to God</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> But if we do not admit this, we shall be liable to fall into foolish opinions, as if it were not the same God who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the times of <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> and all the rest, who neither were <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> after the flesh, nor observed <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, nor any other <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, seeing that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> enjoined such observances; or that God has not wished each race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> continually to perform the same righteous actions: to admit which, seems to be ridiculous and absurd. Therefore we must confess that He, who is ever the same, has commanded these and such like institutions on account of sinful men, and we must declare Him to be benevolent, foreknowing, needing nothing, righteous and good. But if this be not so, tell me, sir, what you think of those matters which we are investigating.</p></blockquote>

<p>And when no one responded:</p>

<blockquote><p>Wherefore, Trypho, I will proclaim to you, and to those who wish to become proselytes, the divine message which I heard from that man.  Do you see that the elements are not idle, and keep no <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>? Remain as you were born. For if there was no need of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, or of the observance of <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, of feasts and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, before <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; no more need is there of them now, after that, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has been born without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> sprung from the stock of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. For when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself was in uncircumcision, he was justified and blessed by reason of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he reposed in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> tells. Moreover, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and the facts themselves compel us to admit that He received <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> for a sign, and not for righteousness. So that it was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> recorded concerning the people, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which shall not be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> on the eighth day shall be cut off from his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. And, furthermore, the inability of the female sex to receive fleshly <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, proves that this <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> has been given for a sign, and not for a work of righteousness. For God has given likewise to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> the ability to observe all things which are righteous and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; but we see that the bodily form of the male has been made different from the bodily form of the female; yet we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that neither of them is righteous or unrighteous merely for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but [is considered righteous] by reason of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and righteousness.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 24. The Christians' circumcision far more excellent</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Now, sirs, it is possible for us to show how the eighth day possessed a certain <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> import, which the seventh day did not possess, and which was promulgated by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through these <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. But lest I appear now to diverge to other subjects, understand what I say: the blood of that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> is obsolete, and we trust in the blood of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; there is now another covenant, and another law has gone forth from Zion. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> circumcises all who will&mdash;as was declared above&mdash;with knives of stone; <span class="stiki" id="note012006"><a href="../bible/jos005.htm#verse2">Joshua&nbsp;5:2</a>; <a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;26:2-3</a></span> that they may be a righteous nation, a people keeping <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, holding to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and maintaining peace. Come then with me, all who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who wish to see the good of Jerusalem. Come, let us go to the light of the Lord; for He has liberated His people, the house of Jacob. Come, all nations; let us gather ourselves together at Jerusalem, no longer plagued by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of her people.

<h2>Chapter 25. The Jews boast in vain that they are sons of Abraham</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Those who justify themselves, and say they are sons of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, shall be desirous even in a small degree to receive the inheritance along with you;  as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by the mouth of Isaiah, cries, speaking thus while he personates them:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>Return from heaven, and behold from the habitation of Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Where is Your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and strength? Where is the multitude of Your mercy? For You have sustained us, O Lord. For You are our Father, because <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of us, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has not recognised us. But You, O Lord, our Father,  deliver us: from the beginning Your name is upon us. O Lord, why have You made us to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> from Your way? And hardened our hearts, so that we do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> You? Return for Your servants' sake, the tribes of Your inheritance, that we may inherit for a little Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain. We were as from the beginning, when You did not bear rule over us, and when Your name was not called upon us. If You will open the heavens, trembling shall seize the mountains before You: and they shall be melted, as wax melts before the fire; and fire shall consume the adversaries, and Your name shall be manifest among the adversaries; the nations shall be put into disorder before Your face. When You shall do <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> things, trembling shall seize the mountains before You. From the beginning we have not heard, nor have our eyes seen a God besides You: and Your works,  the mercy which You shall show to those who repent. He shall meet those who do righteousness, and they shall remember Your ways. Behold, You are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and we were sinning. Therefore we have erred and become all unclean, and all our righteousness is as the rags of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> set apart: and we have faded away like leaves by reason of our iniquities; thus the wind will take us away. And there is none that calls upon Your name, or remembers to take hold of You; for You have turned away Your face from us, and have given us up on account of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And now return, O Lord, for we are all Your people. The city of Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has become desolate. Zion has become as a wilderness, Jerusalem a curse; the house, our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which our fathers blessed, has been burned with fire; and all the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> nations  have fallen along with it. And in addition to these [misfortunes], O Lord, You have refrained Yourself, and are silent, and have humbled us very much.</em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> What is this you say? That none of us shall inherit anything on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain of God?</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 26. No salvation to the Jews except through Christ</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> I do not say so; but those who have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and do <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Christ, if they do not repent, shall not inherit anything on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain. But the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, and have repented of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which they have committed, they shall receive the inheritance along with the patriarchs and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the just men who are descended from Jacob, even although they neither keep the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, nor are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, nor observe the feasts. Assuredly they shall receive the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> inheritance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For God speaks by Isaiah thus:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>I, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, have called You in righteousness, and will hold Your hand, and will strengthen You; and I have given You for a covenant of the people, for a light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out them that are bound from the chains, and those who sit in darkness from the prison-house. <span class="stiki" id="note012013"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;42:6-7</a></span></em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>And again:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>Lift up a standard  for the people; for, lo, the Lord has made it heard unto the end of the earth. Say to the daughters of Zion, Behold, your Saviour has come; having His reward, and His work before His face: and He shall call it a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, redeemed by the Lord. And you shall be called a city sought out, and not forsaken. Who is this that comes from Edom? In red garments from Bosor? This that is beautiful in apparel, going up with great strength? I speak righteousness, and the judgment of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Why are Your garments red, and Your apparel as from the trodden wine-press? You are full of the trodden grape. I have trodden the wine-press all alone, and of the people there is no man with Me; and I have trampled them in fury, and crushed them to the ground, and spilled their blood on the earth. For the day of retribution has come upon them, and the year of redemption is present. And I looked, and there was none to help; and I considered, and none assisted: and My arm delivered; and My fury came on them, and I trampled them in My fury, and spilled their blood on the earth. </em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 27. Why God taught the same things by the prophets as by Moses</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Why do you select and quote whatever you wish from the prophetic writings, but do not refer to those which expressly command the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> to be observed? For Isaiah thus speaks:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>If you shall turn away your foot from the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, so as not to do your pleasure on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day, and shall call the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> delights of your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if you shall not lift your foot to work, and shall not speak a word from your own mouth; then you shall trust in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and He shall <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to go up to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the land; and He shall feed you with the inheritance of Jacob your father: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it. <span class="stiki" id="note012016"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;58:13-14</a></span></em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> I have passed them by, my friends, not because such prophecies were contrary to me, but because you have understood, and  do understand, that although God commands you by all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to do the same things which He also commanded by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, it was on account of the hardness of your hearts, and your ingratitude towards Him, that He continually proclaims them, in order that, even in this way, if you repented, you might please Him, and neither <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> your children to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, nor be partakers with thieves, nor lovers of gifts, nor hunters after revenge, nor fail in doing judgment for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, nor be inattentive to the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> due to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> nor have your hands full of blood. 'For the daughters of Zion have walked with a high neck, both sporting by winking with their eyes, and sweeping along their dresses. <span class="stiki" id="note012017"><a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse16">Isaiah&nbsp;3:16</a></span> For they are all gone aside,' He exclaims, 'they are all become useless. There is none that understands, there is not so much as one. With their tongues they have practised deceit, their throat is an open sepulchre, the poison of asps is under their lips, destruction and misery are in their paths, and the way of peace they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.'  So that, as in the beginning, these things were enjoined you because of your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, in like manner because of your steadfastness in it, or rather your increased proneness to it, by means of the same precepts He calls you to a remembrance or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it. But you are a people hard-hearted and without understanding, both blind and lame, children in whom is no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as He Himself says, honouring Him only with your lips, far from Him in your hearts, teaching doctrines that are your own and not His. For, tell me, did God wish the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when they offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>? Or those to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, who are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and do circumcise on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>; since He commands that on the eighth day&mdash;even though it happen to be a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>&mdash;those who are born shall be always <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>? Or could not the infants be operated upon one day previous or one day subsequent to the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, if He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it is a sinful act upon the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>? Or why did He not teach those&mdash;who are called righteous and pleasing to Him, who lived before <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who were not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in their foreskin, and observed no <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>&mdash;to keep these institutions?</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 28. True righteousness is obtained by Christ</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> We heard you adducing this consideration a little ago, and we have given it attention: for, to tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it is worthy of attention; and that answer which pleases most&mdash;namely, that so it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to Him&mdash;does not satisfy me. For this is ever the shift to which those have recourse who are unable to answer the question.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Since I bring from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and the facts themselves both the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> and the inculcation of them, do not delay or hesitate to put <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in me, although I am an uncircumcised man; so short a time is left you in which to become proselytes. If Christ's coming shall have anticipated you, in vain you will repent, in vain you will weep; for He will not hear you. 'Break up your fallow ground,' Jeremiah has cried to the people, 'and sow not among thorns. Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and circumcise the foreskin of your heart.' <span class="stiki" id="note012019"><a href="../bible/jer004.htm#verse3">Jeremiah&nbsp;4:3</a></span> Do not sow, therefore, among thorns, and in untilled ground, whence you can have no fruit. Know Christ; and behold the fallow ground, good, good and fat, is in your hearts. 'For, behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will visit all them that are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in their foreskins; <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and Judah,  and Edom, and the sons of Moab. For all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> are uncircumcised in their hearts.'  Do you see how that God does not mean this <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> which is given for a sign? For it is of no use to the Egyptians, or the sons of Moab, or the sons of Edom. But though a man be a Scythian or a Persian, if he has the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of His Christ, and keeps the everlasting righteous decrees, he is <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> with the good and useful <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and is a friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God rejoices in his gifts and offerings. But I will lay before you, my friends, the very words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He said to the people by Malachi, one of the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, 'I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord; and I shall not accept your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> at your hands: for from the rising of the sun unto its setting My name shall be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; and in every place a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is offered unto My name, even a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>: for My name is honoured among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, says the Lord; but you profane it.' <span class="stiki" id="note012022"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse10">Malachi&nbsp;1:10</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And by David He said, 'A people whom I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, served Me; at the hearing of the ear they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> Me.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 29. Christ is useless to those who observe the law</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Let us glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all nations gathered together; for He has also visited us. Let us glorify Him by the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, by the Lord of hosts. For He has been gracious towards the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also; and our <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> He esteems more grateful than yours. What need, then, have I of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, who have been witnessed to by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? What need have I of that other <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, who  have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? I think that while I mention this, I would persuade even those who are possessed of scanty intelligence. For these words have neither been prepared by me, nor embellished by the art of man; but David sung them, Isaiah preached them, Zechariah proclaimed them, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wrote them. Are you acquainted with them, Trypho? They are contained in your Scriptures, or rather not yours, but ours.  For we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them; but you, though you read them, do not catch the spirit that is in them. Be not offended at, or reproach us with, the bodily uncircumcision with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has created us; and think it not strange that we drink hot water on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, since God directs the government of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> on this day equally as on all others; and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, as on other days, so on this, are ordered to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; and there are so many righteous men who have performed none of these legal ceremonies, and yet are witnessed to by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 30. Christians possess the true righteousness</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> But impute it to your own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that God even can be accused by those who have no understanding, of not having always instructed all in the same righteous statutes. For such institutions seemed to be unreasonable and unworthy of God to many men, who had not received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your nation were called to conversion and repentance of spirit,  while they were in a sinful condition and labouring under spiritual disease; and that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which was announced subsequent to the death of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is everlasting. And this is mentioned in the Psalm, my friends.  And that we, who have been made wise by them, confess that the statutes of the Lord are sweeter than honey and the honey-comb, is manifest from the fact that, though threatened with death, we do not deny His name. Moreover, it is also manifest to all, that we who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to be kept by Him from strange, i.e., from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and deceitful, spirits; as the word of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, personating one of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, figuratively declares. For we do continually beseech God by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to preserve us from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> which are hostile to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and whom we of old time served, in order that, after our conversion by Him to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we may be blameless. For we call Him Helper and Redeemer, the power of whose name even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> do <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; and at this day, when they are exorcised in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, crucified under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, governor of Jud&aelig;a, they are overcome. And thus it is manifest to all, that His Father has given Him so great power, by virtue of which <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are subdued to His name, and to the dispensation of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a>.</p></blockquote>
