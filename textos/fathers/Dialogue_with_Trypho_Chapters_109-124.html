<h1>Dialogue with Trypho (Chapters 109-124)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 109. The conversion of the Gentiles has been predicted by Micah</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> But that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> would repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in which they led erring lives, when they heard the doctrine preached by His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> from Jerusalem, and which they learned  through them, suffer me to show you by quoting a short statement from the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Micah, one of the twelve [minor <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>]. This is as follows: 'And in the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, established on the top of the mountains; it shall be exalted above the hills, and people shall flow unto it.  And many nations shall go, and say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob; and they shall enlighten us in His way, and we shall walk in His paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among many peoples, and shall rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> any more. And each man shall sit under his vine and under his fig tree; and there shall be none to terrify: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken it. For all people will walk in the name of their gods; but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will assemble her that is afflicted, and gather her that is driven out, and whom I had plagued; and I shall make her that is afflicted a remnant, and her that is oppressed a strong nation. And the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion from henceforth, and even for ever.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 110. A portion of the prophecy already fulfilled in the Christians: the rest shall be fulfilled at the second advent</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Now I am aware that your teachers, sirs, admit the whole of the words of this passage to refer to Christ; and I am likewise aware that they maintain He has not yet come; or if they say that He has come, they assert that it is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> who He is; but when He shall become manifest and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, then it shall be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> who He is. And then, they say, the events mentioned in this passage shall happen, just as if there was no fruit as yet from the words of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. O unreasoning men! understanding not what has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by all these passages, that two advents of Christ have been announced: the one, in which He is set forth as suffering, inglorious, dishonoured, and crucified; but the other, in which He shall come from heaven with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, when the man of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>,  who speaks strange things against the Most  High, shall venture to do unlawful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> on the earth against us the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who, having learned the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worship of God from the law, and the word which went forth from Jerusalem by means of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, have fled for safety to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob and God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and we who were filled with <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and mutual slaughter, and every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, have each through the whole earth changed our warlike weapons&mdash;our swords into ploughshares, and our spears into implements of tillage&mdash;and we cultivate <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, righteousness, philanthropy, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and hope, which we have from the Father Himself through Him who was crucified; and sitting each under his vine, i.e., each man possessing his own married wife. For you are aware that the prophetic word says, 'And his wife shall be like a fruitful vine.'  Now it is evident that no one can terrify or subdue us who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Jesus over all the world. For it is plain that, though beheaded, and crucified, and thrown to wild beasts, and chains, and fire, and all other kinds of torture, we do not give up our confession; but the more such things happen, the more do others and in larger numbers become faithful, and worshippers of God through the name of Jesus. For just as if one should cut away the fruit-bearing parts of a vine, it grows up again, and yields other branches flourishing and fruitful; even so the same thing happens with us. For the vine planted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Christ the Saviour is His people. But the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> shall be fulfilled at His second coming. For the expression, 'He that is afflicted [and driven out],' i.e., from the world, [implies] that, so far as you and all other men have it in your power, each <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> has been driven out not only from his own property, but even from the whole world; for you permit no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to live. But you say that the same <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> has befallen your own nation. Now, if you have been cast out after defeat in battle, you have suffered such treatment <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> indeed, as all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; but we, though we have done no such [<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> acts] after we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are testified to by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that, together with the most righteous, and only spotless and sinless Christ, we are taken away out of the earth. For Isaiah cries, 'Behold how the righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and righteous men are taken away, and no man considers it.' <span class="stiki" id="note012369"><a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;57:1</a></span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 111. The two advents were signified by the two goats. Other figures of the first advent, in which the Gentiles are freed by the blood of Christ</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And that it was declared by <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>, even in the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, that there would be two advents of this Christ, as I have mentioned previously, [is manifest] from the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the goats presented for <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> during the fast. And again, by what <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Joshua did, the same thing was <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolically</a> announced and told beforehand. For the one of them, stretching out his hands, remained till evening on the hill, his hands being supported; and this reveals a type of no other thing than of the cross: and the other, whose name was altered to Jesus (Joshua), led the fight, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> conquered. Now this took place in the case of both those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may perceive how one of them could not bear up both the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>: I mean, the type of the cross and the type of the name. For this is, was, and shall be the strength of Him alone, whose name every power dreads, being very much tormented because they shall be destroyed by Him. Therefore our suffering and crucified Christ was not cursed by the law, but made it manifest that He alone would save those who do not depart from His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And the blood of the passover, sprinkled on each man's door-posts and lintel, delivered those who were saved in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of the Egyptians were destroyed. For the passover was Christ, who was afterwards <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, as also Isaiah said, 'He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.' <span class="stiki" id="note012370"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span> And it is written, that on the day of the passover you seized Him, and that also during the passover you crucified Him. And as the blood of the passover saved those who were in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, so also the blood of Christ will deliver from death those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Would <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, have been deceived if this sign had not been above the doors? I do not say that; but I affirm that He announced beforehand the future <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> through the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For the sign of the scarlet thread, which the spies, sent to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> by Joshua, son of Nave (Nun), gave to Rahab the harlot, telling her to bind it to the window through which she let them down to escape from their enemies, also manifested the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by which those who were at one time harlots and unrighteous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> out of all nations are saved, receiving remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and continuing no longer in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 112. The Jews expound these signs jejunely and feebly, and take up their attention only with insignificant matters</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> But you, expounding these things in a low [and earthly] manner, impute much weakness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if you thus listen to them merely, and do not investigate the force of the words spoken. Since even <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> would in this way be considered  a transgressor: for he enjoined that no likeness of anything in heaven, or on earth, or in the sea, be made; and then he himself made a brazen serpent and set it on a standard, and bade those who were bitten look at it: and they were saved when they looked at it. Will the serpent, then, which (I have already said) God had in the beginning cursed and cut off by the great sword, as Isaiah says, <span class="stiki" id="note012371"><a href="../bible/isa027.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;27:1</a></span> be understood as having preserved at that time the people? And shall we receive these things in the foolish acceptation of your teachers, and [regard] them not as signs? And shall we not rather refer the standard to the resemblance of the crucified <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, since also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by his outstretched hands, together with him who was named Jesus (Joshua), achieved a victory for your people? For in this way we shall cease to be at a loss about the things which the lawgiver did, when he, without forsaking <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, persuaded the people to hope in a beast through which transgression and disobedience had their origin. And this was done and said by the blessed <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> with much intelligence and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>; and there is nothing said or done by any one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, without exception, which one can <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> reprehend, if he possess the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is in them. But if your teachers only expound to you why female camels are spoken of in this passage, and are not in that; or why so many measures of fine flour and so many measures of oil [are used] in the offerings; and do so in a low and sordid manner, while they never venture either to speak of or to expound the points which are great and worthy of investigation, or command you to give no audience to us while we expound them, and to come not into conversation with us; will they not deserve to hear what <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> said to them: 'Whited sepulchres, which appear beautiful outward, and within are full of dead men's bones; which pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of mint, and swallow a camel: you blind guides!'  If, then, you will not despise the doctrines of those who exalt themselves and wish to be called Rabbi, Rabbi, and come with such earnestness and intelligence to the words of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> as to suffer the same inflictions from your own people which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> themselves did, you cannot receive any advantage whatsoever from the prophetic writings.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 113. Joshua was a figure of Christ</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Jesus:</strong> What I mean is this. Jesus (Joshua), as I have now frequently remarked, who was called Oshea, when he was sent to spy out the land of Canaan, was named by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> Jesus (Joshua). Why he did this you neither ask, nor are at a loss about it, nor make strict inquiries. Therefore Christ has escaped your notice; and though you read, you understand not; and even now, though you hear that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is our Christ, you consider not that the name was bestowed on Him not purposelessly nor by chance. But you make a theological discussion as to why one '<span class="greek">&#x03B1;</span> ' was added to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> first name; and as to why one '<span class="greek">&#x03C1;</span> ' was added to Sarah's name, you use similar high-sounding disputations.  But why do you not similarly investigate the reason why the name of Oshea the son of Nave (Nun), which his father gave him, was changed to Jesus (Joshua)? But since not only was his name altered, but he was also appointed successor to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, being the only one of his contemporaries who came out from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, he led the surviving people into the Holy Land; and as he, not <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, led the people into the Holy Land, and as he distributed it by lot to those who entered along with him, so also Jesus the Christ will turn again the dispersion of the people, and will distribute the good land to each one, though not in the same manner. For the former gave them a temporary inheritance, seeing he was neither Christ who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; but the latter, after the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> resurrection,  shall give us the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> possession. The former, after he had been named Jesus (Joshua), and after he had received strength from His Spirit, caused the sun to stand still. For I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that it was Jesus who appeared to and conversed with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and all the other patriarchs without exception, ministering to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father; who also, I say, came to be born man by the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, and I lives for ever. For the latter is He after  whom and by whom the Father will renew both the heaven and the earth; this is He who shall shine an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light in Jerusalem; this is he who is the king of Salem after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Priest of the Most High. The former is said to have <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the people a second time with knives of stone (which was a sign of this <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> with which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Himself has <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> us from the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> made of stone and of other materials), and to have collected together those who were <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> from the uncircumcision, i.e., from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the world, in every place by the knives of stone, to wit, the words of our Lord Jesus. For I have shown that Christ was proclaimed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> a Stone and a Rock. Accordingly the knives of stone we shall take to mean His words, by means of  which so many who were in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> have been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> from uncircumcision with the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the heart, with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by Jesus commanded those from that time to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> who derived their <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, saying that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (Joshua) would circumcise a second time with knives of stone those who entered into that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> land.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 114. Some rules for discerning what is said about Christ. The circumcision of the Jews is very different from that which Christians receive</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> sometimes brought about that something, which was the type of the future, should be done clearly; sometimes He uttered words about what was to take place, as if it was then taking place, or had taken place. And unless those who read perceive this art, they will not be able to follow the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as they ought. For example's sake, I shall repeat some prophetic passages, that you may understand what I say. When He speaks by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, 'He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb before the shearer,' <span class="stiki" id="note012376"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span> He speaks as if the suffering had already taken place. And when He says again, 'I have stretched out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people;' <span class="stiki" id="note012377"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;65:2</a></span> and when He says, 'Lord, who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report?' <span class="stiki" id="note012378"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;53:1</a></span>&mdash;the words are spoken as if announcing events which had already come to pass. For I have shown that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is oftentimes called a Stone in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, and in figurative speech Jacob and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And again, when He says, 'I shall behold the heavens, the works of Your fingers,'  unless I understand His method of using words,  I shall not understand intelligently, but just as your teachers suppose, fancying that the Father of all, the unbegotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has hands and feet, and fingers, and a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, like a composite being; and they for this reason teach that it was the Father Himself who appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and to Jacob. Blessed therefore are we who have been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the second time with knives of stone. For your first <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was and is performed by iron instruments, for you remain hard-hearted; but our <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which is the second, having been instituted after yours, circumcises us from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and from absolutely every kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> by sharp stones, i.e., by the words [preached] by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of the corner-stone cut out without hands. And our hearts are thus <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so that we are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> to die for the name of the good Rock, which causes living water to burst forth for the hearts of those who by Him have loved the Father of all, and which gives those who are willing to drink of the water of life. But you do not comprehend me when I speak these things; for you have not understood what it has been prophesied that Christ would do, and you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> us who draw your attention to what has been written. For Jeremiah thus cries: 'Woe unto you! Because you have forsaken the living fountain, and have dug for yourselves broken cisterns that can hold no water. Shall there be a wilderness where Mount Zion is, because I gave Jerusalem a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> in your sight?' <span class="stiki" id="note012381"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse13">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:13</a></span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 115. Prediction about the Christians in Zechariah. The malignant way which the Jews have in disputations</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> But you ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Zechariah when he shows in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and announces it obscurely. The following are his words: 'Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I shall dwell in the midst of you, says the Lord. And many nations shall be added to the Lord in that day.

And the Lord shall inherit Judah his portion in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> land, and He shall choose Jerusalem again. Let all flesh <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> before the Lord, for He is raised up out of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> clouds. And He showed me Jesus (Joshua) the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> standing before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> [of the Lord ]; and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> stood at his right hand to resist him. And the Lord said to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you.

<p>As Trypho was about to reply and contradict me, I said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Wait and hear what I say first: for I am not to give the explanation which you suppose, as if there had been no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the name of Joshua (Jesus) in the land of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, where your nation were prisoners. But even if I did, I have shown that if there  was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Joshua (Jesus) in your nation, yet the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had not seen him in his revelation, just as he had not seen either the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> or the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord by eyesight, and in his waking condition, but in a trance, at the time when the revelation was made to him.  But I now say, that as [Scripture] said that the Son of Nave (Nun) by the name Jesus (Joshua) wrought powerful works and exploits which proclaimed beforehand what would be performed by our Lord; so I proceed now to show  that the revelation made among your people in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> in the days of Jesus (Joshua) the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, was an announcement of the things to be accomplished by our Priest, who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> the Father of all.</p>

<p>Indeed, I wondered, why a little ago you kept silence while I was speaking, and why you did not interrupt me when I said that the son of Nave (Nun) was the only one of contemporaries who came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> that entered the Holy Land along with the men described as younger than that generation. For you swarm and light on sores like flies. For though one should speak ten thousand words well, if there happen to be one little word displeasing to you, because not sufficiently intelligible or accurate, you make no account of the many good words, but lay hold of the little word, and are very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in setting it up as something impious and guilty; in order that, when you are judged with the very same judgment by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you may have a much heavier account to render for your great audacities, whether <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> actions, or bad interpretations which you obtain by falsifying the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For with what judgment you judge, it is righteous that you be judged withal.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 116. It is shown how this prophecy suits the Christians</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> But to give you the account of the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, I take up again my discourse, and I assert that even that revelation was made for us who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ the High Priest, namely this crucified One; and though we lived in fornication and all kinds of filthy conversation, we have by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, according to His Father's will, stripped ourselves of all those filthy wickednesses with which we were imbued. And though the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is ever at hand to resist us, and anxious to seduce all to himself, yet the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e., the Power of God sent to us through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, rebukes him, and he departs from us. And we are just as if drawn out from the fire, when purified from our former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and [rescued] from the affliction and the fiery trial by which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and all his coadjutors try us; out of which Jesus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has promised again to deliver us,  and invest us with prepared garments, if we do His commandments; and has undertaken to provide an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom [for us]. For just as that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (Joshua), called by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, evidently had on filthy garments because he is said to have taken a harlot for a wife,  and is called a brand plucked out of the fire, because he had received remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> that resisted him was rebuked; even so we, who through the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> as one man in God the Maker of all, have been stripped, through the name of His first-begotten Son, of the filthy garments, i.e., of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and being vehemently inflamed by the word of His calling, we are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> high <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> race of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as even God Himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, saying that in every place among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are presented to Him well-pleasing and pure. Now God receives <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> from no one, except through His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 117. Malachi's prophecy concerning the sacrifices of the Christians. It cannot be taken as referring to the prayers of Jews of the dispersion</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, anticipating all the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which we offer through this name, and which Jesus the Christ enjoined us to offer, i.e., in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> of the bread and the cup, and which are presented by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in all places throughout the world, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that they are well-pleasing to Him. But He utterly rejects those presented by you and by those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of yours, saying, 'And I will not accept your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> at your hands; for from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> (He says); but you profane it.' <span class="stiki" id="note012389"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse10">Malachi&nbsp;1:10-12</a></span> Yet even now, in your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of contention, you assert that God does not accept the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of those who dwelt then in Jerusalem, and were called <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>; but says that He is pleased with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the individuals of that nation then dispersed, and calls their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. Now, that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and giving of thanks, when offered by worthy men, are the only perfect and well-pleasing <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I also admit. For such alone <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> have undertaken to offer, and in the remembrance effected by their solid and liquid food, whereby the suffering of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>  which He endured is brought to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, whose name the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> of your nation and your teachers have caused to be profaned and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> over all the earth. But these filthy garments, which have been put by you on all who have become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, God shows shall be taken away from us, when He shall raise all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from the dead, and appoint some to be incorruptible, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and free from sorrow in the everlasting and imperishable kingdom; but shall send others away to the everlasting punishment of fire. But as to you and your teachers deceiving yourselves when you interpret what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says as referring to  those of your nation then in dispersion, and maintain that their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered in every place are pure and well-pleasing, learn that you are speaking <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, and trying by all means to cheat yourselves: for, first of all, not even now does your nation extend from the rising to the setting of the sun, but there are nations among which none of your race ever dwelt. For there is not one single race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whether barbarians, or Greeks, or whatever they may be called, nomads, or vagrants, or herdsmen living in tents, among whom <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and giving of thanks are not offered through the name of the crucified Jesus.  And then,  as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> show, at the time when Malachi wrote this, your dispersion over all the earth, which now exists, had not taken place.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 118. He exhorts to repentance before Christ comes; in whom Christians, since they believe, are far more religious than Jews</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> So that you ought rather to desist from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of strife, and repent before the great day of judgment come, wherein all those of your tribes who have pierced this Christ shall mourn as I have shown has been declared by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. And I have explained that the Lord swore, 'after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>,'  and what this prediction means; and the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Isaiah which says, 'His burial is taken away from the midst,' <span class="stiki" id="note012394"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;53:8</a></span> I have already said, referred to the future burying and rising again of Christ; and I have frequently remarked that this very Christ is the Judge of all the living and the dead. And Nathan likewise, speaking to David about Him, thus continued: 'I will be His Father, and He shall be my Son; and my mercy shall I not take away from Him, as I did from them that went before Him; and I will establish Him in my house, and in His kingdom for ever.' <span class="stiki" id="note012395"><a href="../bible/2sa007.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;7:14</a>f.</span> And Ezekiel says, 'There shall be no other prince in the house but He.' <span class="stiki" id="note012396"><a href="../bible/eze044.htm#verse3">Ezekiel&nbsp;44:3</a></span> For He is the chosen Priest and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> King, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, inasmuch as He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and do not suppose that Isaiah or the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> speak of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of blood or libations being presented at the altar on His second advent, but of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and spiritual praises and giving of thanks. And we have not in vain <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him, and have not been led astray by those who taught us such doctrines; but this has come to pass through the wonderful foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that we, through the calling of the new and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> covenant, that is, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, might be found more intelligent and God-fearing than yourselves, who are considered to be lovers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men of understanding, but are not. Isaiah, filled with admiration of this, said: 'And kings shall shut their mouths: for those to whom no announcement has been made in regard to Him  shall see; and those who heard not shall understand.

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> You do well; and though you repeat the same things at considerable length, be assured that I and my companions listen with pleasure.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 119. Christians are the holy people promised to Abraham. They have been called like Abraham</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Would you suppose, sirs, that we could ever have understood these matters in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, if we had not received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to discern by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him whose pleasure it was? In order that the saying of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>  might come to pass, 'They provoked me with strange [gods], they provoked me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with their abominations.

You have forsaken God that begot you, and forgotten God that brought you up. And the Lord saw, and was jealous, and was provoked to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by reason of the rage of His sons and daughters: and He said, I will turn My face away from them, and I will show what shall come on them at the last; for it is a very froward generation, children in whom is no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. They have moved Me to jealousy with that which is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they have provoked Me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; and I will move them to jealousy with that which is not a nation, I will provoke them to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with a foolish people. For a fire is kindled from Mine <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and it shall burn to Hades.

What larger measure of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, then, did Christ bestow on <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>? This, namely, that He called him with His voice by the like calling, telling him to quit the land wherein he dwelt. And He has called all of us by that voice, and we have left already the way of living in which we used to spend our days, passing our time in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> after the fashions of the other inhabitants of the earth; and along with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> we shall inherit the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> land, when we shall receive the inheritance for an endless <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, being children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> through the like <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

Accordingly, He promises to him a nation of similar <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, God-fearing, righteous, and delighting the Father; but it is not you, 'in whom is no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.'</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 120. Christians were promised to Isaac, Jacob, and Judah</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Observe, too, how the same promises are made to Isaac and to Jacob. For thus He speaks to Isaac: 'And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.' <span class="stiki" id="note012406"><a href="../bible/gen026.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;26:4</a></span> And to Jacob: 'And in you and in your seed shall all <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the earth be blessed.' <span class="stiki" id="note012407"><a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;28:14</a></span> He says that neither to <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> nor to Reuben, nor to any other; only to those of whom the Christ should arise, according to the dispensation, through the Virgin Mary. But if you would consider the blessing of Judah, you would perceive what I say. For the seed is divided from Jacob, and comes down through Judah, and Phares, and Jesse, and David. And this was a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the fact that some of your nation would be found children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and found, too, in the lot of Christ; but that others, who are indeed children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, would be like the sand on the sea-shore, barren and fruitless, much in quantity, and without number indeed, but bearing no fruit whatever, and only drinking the water of the sea. And a vast multitude in your nation are convicted of being of this kind, imbibing doctrines of bitterness and godlessness, but spurning the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He speaks therefore in the passage relating to Judah: 'A prince shall not fail from Judah, nor a ruler from his thighs, till that which is laid up for him come; and He shall be the expectation of the nations.' <span class="stiki" id="note012408"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;49:10</a></span> And it is plain that this was spoken not of Judah, but of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For all we out of all nations do expect not Judah, but Jesus, who led your fathers out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> referred even to the advent of Christ: 'Till He come for whom this is laid up, and He shall be the expectation of nations.' Jesus came, therefore, as we have shown at length, and is expected again to appear above the clouds; whose name you profane, and labour hard to get it profaned over all the earth. It were possible for me, sirs, to contend against you about the reading which you so interpret, saying it is written, 'Till the things laid up for Him come;' though the Seventy have not so explained it, but thus, 'Till He comes for whom this is laid up.' But since what follows indicates that the reference is to Christ (for it is, 'and He shall be the expectation of nations'), I do not proceed to have a mere verbal controversy with you, as I have not attempted to establish <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> about Christ from the passages of Scripture which are not admitted by you  which I quoted from the words of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, and Esdras, and David; but from those which are even now admitted by you, which had your teachers comprehended, be well assured they would have deleted them, as they did those about the death of Isaiah, whom you sawed asunder with a wooden saw. And this was a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> type of Christ being about to cut your nation in two, and to raise those worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the everlasting kingdom along with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; but He has said that He will send others to the condemnation of the unquenchable fire along with similar disobedient and impenitent men from all the nations. 'For they shall come,' He said, 'from the west and from the east, and shall sit down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.'  And I have mentioned  these things, taking nothing whatever into consideration, except the speaking of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and refusing to be coerced by any one, even though I should be immediately torn in pieces by you. For I gave no thought to any of my people, that is, the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, when I had a communication in writing with C&aelig;sar,  but stated that they were wrong in trusting to the magician Simon of their own nation, who, they say, is God above all power, and authority, and might.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 121. From the fact that the Gentiles believe in Jesus, it is evident that He is Christ</h2>

<p>And as they kept silence, I went on:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> [The Scripture], speaking by David about this Christ, my friends, said no longer that 'in His seed' the nations should be blessed, but 'in Him.' So it is here: 'His name shall rise up for ever above the sun; and in Him shall all nations be blessed.'  But if all nations are <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and we of all nations <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, then He is indeed the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and we are those blessed by Him. God formerly gave the sun as an object of worship,  as it is written, but no one ever was seen to endure death on account of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the sun; but for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> you may see men of every nation who have endured and do endure all sufferings, rather than deny Him. For the word of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and wisdom is more ardent and more light-giving than the rays of the sun, and sinks down into the depths of heart and mind. Hence also the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> said, 'His name shall rise up above the sun.' And again, Zechariah says, 'His name is the East.' <span class="stiki" id="note012414"><a href="../bible/zec006.htm#verse12">Zechariah&nbsp;6:12</a></span> And speaking of the same, he says that 'each tribe shall mourn.' <span class="stiki" id="note012415"><a href="../bible/zec012.htm#verse12">Zechariah&nbsp;12:12</a></span> But if He so shone forth and was so mighty in His first advent (which was without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and comeliness, and very contemptible), that in no nation He is unknown, and everywhere men have repented of the old <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in each nation's way of living, so that even <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were subject to His name, and all powers and kingdoms feared His name more than they feared all the dead, shall He not on His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> advent destroy by all means all those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> Him, and who unrighteously departed from Him, but give rest to His own, rewarding them with all they have looked for? To us, therefore, it has been granted to hear, and to understand, and to be saved by this Christ, and to recognise all the [truths revealed] by the Father. Wherefore He said to Him: 'It is a great thing for You to be called my servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and turn again the dispersed of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. I have appointed You for a light to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that You may be their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> unto the end of the earth.' <span class="stiki" id="note012416"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;49:6</a></span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 122. The Jews understand this of the proselytes without reason</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> You think that these words refer to the stranger  and the proselytes, but in fact they refer to us who have been illumined by Jesus. For Christ would have borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> even to them; but now you have become twofold more the children of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, as He said Himself. <span class="stiki" id="note012418"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;23:15</a></span> Therefore what was written by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> was spoken not of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but of us, concerning whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> speaks: 'I will lead the blind by a way which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not; and they shall walk in paths which they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. And I am <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, and my servant whom I have chosen.' <span class="stiki" id="note012419"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse16">Isaiah&nbsp;42:16</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;43:10</a></span> To whom, then, does Christ bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>? Manifestly to those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. But the proselytes not only do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but twofold more than yourselves <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> His name, and wish to torture and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> us who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him; for in all points they strive to be like you. And again in other words He cries: 'I the Lord have called You in righteousness, and will hold Your hand, and will strengthen You, and will give You for a covenant of the people, for a light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out the prisoners from their bonds.' <span class="stiki" id="note012420"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;42:6</a></span> These words, indeed, sirs, refer also to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and concern the enlightened nations; or will you say again, He speaks to them of the law and the proselytes?</p></blockquote>

<p>Then some of those who had come on the second day cried out as if they had been in a theatre:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho's companions:</strong> But what? Does He not refer to the law, and to those illumined by it? Now these are proselytes.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> <em>(Looking towards Trypho.)</em> No, since, if the law were able to enlighten the nations and those who possess it, what need is there of a new covenant? But since God announced beforehand that He would send a new covenant, and an everlasting law and commandment, we will not understand this of the old law and its proselytes, but of Christ and His proselytes, namely us <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, whom He has illumined, as He says somewhere: 'Thus says the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard You, and in a day of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> have I helped You, and I have given You for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, and to inherit the deserted.' <span class="stiki" id="note012421"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;49:8</a></span> What, then, is Christ's inheritance? Is it not the nations? What is the covenant of God? Is it not  Christ? As He says in another place: 'You are my Son; this day have I begotten You. Ask of Me, and I shall give You the nations for Your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 123. Ridiculous interpretations of the Jews. Christians are the true Israel</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> As, therefore, all these latter prophecies refer to Christ and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, you should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the former refer to Him and them in like manner. For the proselytes have no need of a covenant, if, since there is one and the same law imposed on all that are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> speaks about them thus: 'And the stranger shall also be joined with them, and shall be joined to the house of Jacob;' <span class="stiki" id="note012423"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;14:1</a></span> and because the <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselyte</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> that he may have access to the people, becomes like one of themselves,  while we who have been deemed worthy to be called a people are yet <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, because we have not been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>. Besides, it is ridiculous for you to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the eyes of the proselytes are to be opened while your own are not, and that you be understood as blind and deaf while they are enlightened. And it will be still more ridiculous for you, if you say that the law has been given to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, but you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it. For you would have stood in awe of God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and would not have been lawless, wandering sons; being much afraid of hearing God always say, 'Children in whom is no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And who are blind, but my servants? And deaf, but they that rule over them? And the servants of God have been made blind. You see often, but have not observed; your ears have been opened, and you have not heard.'  Is God's commendation of you <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>? And is God's testimony seemly for His servants? You are not ashamed though you often hear these words. You do not tremble at God's threats, for you are a people foolish and hard-hearted. 'Therefore, behold, I will proceed to remove this people,' says the Lord; 'and I will remove them, and destroy the wisdom of the wise, and hide the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note012426"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;29:14</a></span> Deservedly too: for you are neither wise nor <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, but crafty and unscrupulous; wise only to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but utterly incompetent to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the hidden counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or the faithful covenant of the Lord, or to find out the everlasting paths. 'Therefore, says the Lord, I will raise up to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and to Judah the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and the seed of beasts.' <span class="stiki" id="note012427"><a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse27">Jeremiah&nbsp;31:27</a></span> And by Isaiah He speaks thus concerning another <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: 'In that day shall there be a third <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> among the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> and the Egyptians, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the land which the Lord of Sabaoth has blessed, saying, blessed shall my people in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and in Assyria be, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> my inheritance.'  Since then God blesses this people, and calls them <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and declares them to be His inheritance, how is it that you repent not of the deception you practise on yourselves, as if you alone were the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and of execrating the people whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has blessed? For when He speaks to Jerusalem and its environs, He thus added: 'And I will beget men upon you, even my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and they shall inherit you, and you shall be a possession for them; and you shall be no longer bereaved of them.' <span class="stiki" id="note012429"><a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse12">Ezekiel&nbsp;36:12</a></span> </p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> What, then? Are you <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? And speaks He such things of you?</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> If, indeed, we had not entered into a lengthy  discussion on these topics, I might have <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether you ask this question in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; but since we have brought the matter to a conclusion by demonstration and with your assent, I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what I have just said, or desire again mere contention, but that you are urging me to exhibit the same <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to these men.</p></blockquote>

<p>And in compliance with the assent expressed in his eyes, I continued:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Again in Isaiah, if you have ears to hear it, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, speaking of Christ in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, calls Him Jacob and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. He speaks thus: 'Jacob is my servant, I will uphold Him; <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is my elect, I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He shall bring forth judgment to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. He shall not strive, nor cry, neither shall any one hear His voice in the street: a bruised reed He shall not break, and smoking flax He shall not quench; but He shall bring forth judgment to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: He shall shine,  and shall not be broken till He have set judgment on the earth. And in His name shall the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> trust.' <span class="stiki" id="note012432"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;42:1-4</a></span> As therefore from the one man Jacob, who was surnamed <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, all your nation has been called Jacob and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; so we from Christ, who begot us unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, like Jacob, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Judah, and Joseph, and David, are called and are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and keep the commandments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 124. Christians are the sons of God</h2>

<p>And when I saw that they were perturbed because I said that we are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I anticipated their questioning:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Listen, sirs, how the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> speaks of this people, saying that they are all sons of the Highest; and how this very Christ will be present in their assembly, rendering judgment to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The  words are spoken by David, and are, according to your version of them, thus: 'God stands in the congregation of gods; He judges among the gods. How long do you judge <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, and accept the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>? Judge for the orphan and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and needy. Deliver the needy, and save the poor out of the hand of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, neither have they understood; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth shall be shaken. I said, You are gods, and are all children of the Most High. But you die like men, and fall like one of the princes. Arise, O God! judge the earth, for You shall inherit all nations.'  But in the version of the Seventy it is written, 'Behold, you die like men, and fall like one of the princes,'  in order to manifest the disobedience of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash;I mean of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>&mdash;and the fall of one of the princes, i.e., of him who was called the serpent, who fell with a great overthrow, because he deceived Eve. But as my discourse is not intended to touch on this point, but to prove to you that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> reproaches men because they were made like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, free from suffering and death, provided that they kept His commandments, and were deemed deserving of the name of His sons, and yet they, becoming like <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>, work out death for themselves; let the interpretation of the Psalm be held just as you wish, yet thereby it is demonstrated that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are deemed worthy of becoming <q>gods,</q> and of having power to become sons of the Highest; and shall be each by himself judged and condemned like <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>. Now I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> at length that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called God.</p></blockquote>
