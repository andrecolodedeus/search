<h1>Dialogue with Trypho (Chapters 125-142)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 125. He explains what force the word Israel has, and how it suits Christ</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> I wish, sirs, to learn from you what is the force of the name <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>And as they were silent, I continued:</p>

<blockquote><p>I shall tell you what I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: for I do not think it right, when I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, not to speak; or, suspecting that you do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and yet from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> or from <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> deceive yourselves,  to be continually solicitous; but I speak all things simply and candidly, as my Lord said: 'A sower went forth to sow the seed; and some fell by the wayside; and some among thorns, and some on stony ground, and some on good ground.' <span class="stiki" id="note012436"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;13:3</a></span> I must speak, then, in the hope of finding good ground somewhere; since that Lord of mine, as One strong and powerful, comes to demand back His own from all, and will not condemn His steward if He recognises that he, by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that the Lord is powerful and has come to demand His own, has given it to every bank, and has not dug for any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatsoever. Accordingly the name <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> signifies this, A man who overcomes power; for <em>Isra</em> is a man overcoming, and <em>El</em> is power.  And that Christ would act so when He became man was foretold by the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Jacob's wrestling with Him who appeared to him, in that He ministered to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, yet nevertheless is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in that He is the first-begotten of all creatures. For when He became man, as I previously remarked, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> came to Him&mdash;i.e., that power which is called the serpent and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>&mdash;tempting Him, and striving to effect His downfall by asking Him to worship him. But He destroyed and overthrew the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> him to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, in that he asked to be worshipped as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, contrary to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>; who is an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For He answers him, 'It is written, You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.' <span class="stiki" id="note012438"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;4:10</a></span> Then, overcome and convicted, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> departed at that time. But since our Christ was to be numbed, i.e., by pain and experience of suffering, He made a previous intimation of this by touching Jacob's thigh, and causing it to shrink. But <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was His name from the beginning, to which He altered the name of the blessed Jacob when He blessed him with His own name, proclaiming thereby that all who through Him have fled for refuge to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, constitute the blessed <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. But you, having understood none of this, and not being prepared to understand, since you are the children of Jacob after the fleshly seed, expect that you shall be assuredly saved. But that you deceive yourselves in such matters, I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by many words.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 126. The various names of Christ according to both natures. It is shown that He is God, and appeared to the patriarchs</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> But if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, Trypho, who He is that is called at one time the Angel of great counsel,  and a Man by Ezekiel, and like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> by Daniel, and a Child by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, and Christ and God to be worshipped by David, and Christ and a Stone by many, and Wisdom by Solomon, and Joseph and Judah and a Star by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and the East by Zechariah, and the Suffering One and Jacob and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by Isaiah again, and a Rod, and Flower, and Corner-Stone, and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, you would not have <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> Him who has now come, and been  born, and suffered, and ascended to heaven; who shall also come again, and then your twelve tribes shall mourn. For if you had understood what has been written by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, you would not have denied that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Son of the only, unbegotten, unutterable God. For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says somewhere in Exodus the following: 'The Lord spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and said to him, I am the Lord, and I appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to Isaac, and to Jacob, being their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and my name I revealed not to them, and I established my covenant with them.'  And thus again he says, 'A man wrestled with Jacob,'  and asserts it was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; narrating that Jacob said, 'I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.' And it is recorded that he called the place where He wrestled with him, appeared to and blessed him, the Face of God (Peniel). And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says that God appeared also to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> near the oak in Mamre, when he was sitting at the door of his tent at mid-day. Then he goes on to say: 'And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, three men stood before him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them.' <span class="stiki" id="note012442"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;18:2</a></span> After a little, one of them promises a son to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: 'Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, and I am old? Is anything impossible with God? At the time appointed I will return, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. And they went away from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.'  Again he speaks of them thus: 'And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note012444"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;18:16</a></span> Then to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> He who was and is again speaks: 'I will not hide from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, my servant, what I intend to do.' <span class="stiki" id="note012445"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;18:17</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>And what follows in the writings of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> I quoted and explained:</p>

<blockquote><p>From which I have demonstrated that He who is described as God appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and the other patriarchs, was appointed under the authority of the Father and Lord, and ministers to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then I went on to say what I had not said before:</p>

<blockquote><p>And so, when the people desired to eat flesh, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had lost <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him, who also there is called the Angel, and who promised that God would give them to satiety, He who is both God and the Angel, sent by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is described as saying and doing these things. For thus the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says: 'And the Lord said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, Will the Lord's hand not be sufficient? You shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> now whether my word shall conceal you or not.' <span class="stiki" id="note012446"><a href="../bible/num011.htm#verse23">Numbers&nbsp;11:23</a></span> And again, in other words, it thus says: 'But the Lord spoke unto me, You shall not go over this Jordan: the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who goes before your face, He shall cut off the nations.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 127. These passages of Scripture do not apply to the Father, but to the Word</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> These and other such sayings are recorded by the lawgiver and by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and I suppose that I have stated sufficiently, that wherever  God says, 'God went up from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,' <span class="stiki" id="note012449"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;18:22</a></span> or, 'The Lord spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,' <span class="stiki" id="note012450"><a href="../bible/exo006.htm#verse29">Exodus&nbsp;6:29</a></span> and 'The Lord came down to behold the tower which the sons of men had built,' <span class="stiki" id="note012451"><a href="../bible/gen011.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;11:5</a></span> or when 'God shut <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> into the ark,' <span class="stiki" id="note012452"><a href="../bible/gen007.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;7:16</a></span> you must not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the unbegotten God Himself came down or went up from any place. For the ineffable Father and Lord of all neither has come to any place, nor walks, nor sleeps, nor rises up, but remains in His own place, wherever that is, quick to behold and quick to hear, having neither eyes nor ears, but being of indescribable might; and He sees all things, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, and none of us escapes His observation; and He is not moved or confined to a spot in the whole world, for He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the world was made. How, then, could He talk with any one, or be seen by any one, or appear on the smallest portion of the earth, when the people at Sinai were not able to look even on the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him who was sent from Him; and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself could not enter into the tabernacle which he had erected, when it was filled with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> could not endure to stand before the temple when Solomon conveyed the ark into the house in Jerusalem which he had built for it? Therefore neither <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, nor Isaac, nor Jacob, nor any other man, saw the Father and ineffable Lord of all, and also of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but [saw] Him who was according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Angel because He ministered to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; whom also it pleased Him to be born man by the Virgin; who also was fire when He conversed with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> from the bush. Since, unless we thus comprehend the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, it must follow that the Father and Lord of all had not been in heaven when what <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wrote took place: 'And the Lord rained upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven.' <span class="stiki" id="note012453"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;19:24</a></span> and again, when it is thus said by David: 'Lift up your gates, you rulers; and be lifted up, you everlasting gates; and the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall enter;'  and again, when He says: 'The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 128. The Word is sent not as an inanimate power, but as a person begotten of the Father's substance</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And that Christ being Lord, and God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and appearing formerly in power as Man, and Angel, and in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of fire as at the bush, so also was manifested at the judgment executed on <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, has been demonstrated fully by what has been said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then I repeated once more all that I had previously quoted from Exodus, about the vision in the bush, and the naming of Joshua (Jesus), and continued:</p>

<blockquote><p>And do not suppose, sirs, that I am speaking superfluously when I repeat these words frequently: but it is because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that some wish to anticipate these remarks, and to say that the power sent from the Father of all which appeared to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, or to Jacob, is called an Angel because He came to men (for by Him the commands of the Father have been proclaimed to men); is called Glory, because He appears in a vision sometimes that cannot be borne; is called a Man, and a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, because He appears arrayed in such forms as the Father pleases; and they call Him the Word, because He carries tidings from the Father to men: but maintain that this power is indivisible and inseparable from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, just as they say that the light of the sun on earth is indivisible and inseparable from the sun in the heavens; as when it sinks, the light sinks along with it; so the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when He chooses, say they, causes His power to spring forth, and when He chooses, He makes it return to Himself. In this way, they teach, He made the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that there are <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who always exist, and are never reduced to that form out of which they sprang. And that this power which the prophetic word calls <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as has been also amply demonstrated, and Angel, is not numbered [as different] in name only like the light of the sun but is indeed something numerically distinct, I have discussed briefly in what has gone before; when I asserted that this power was begotten from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by His power and will, but not by abscission, as if the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Father were divided; as all other things partitioned and divided are not the same after as before they were divided: and, for the sake of example, I took the case of fires kindled from a fire, which we see to be distinct from it, and yet that from which many can be kindled is by no means made less, but remains the same.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 129. That is confirmed from other passages of Scripture</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And now I shall again recite the words which I have spoken in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this point. When <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, 'The Lord rained fire from the Lord out of heaven,' the prophetic word indicates that there were two in number: One upon the earth, who, it says, descended to behold the cry of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>; Another in heaven, who also is Lord of the Lord on earth, as He is Father and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His power and of His being Lord and God. Again, when the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> records that God said in the beginning, 'Behold, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> has become like one of Us,' <span class="stiki" id="note012456"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;3:22</a></span> this phrase, 'like one of Us,' is also indicative of number; and the words do not admit of a figurative meaning, as the sophists endeavour to affix on them, who are able neither to tell nor to understand the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And it is written in the book of Wisdom: 'If I should tell you daily events, I would be mindful to enumerate them from the beginning. The Lord created me the beginning of His ways for His works. From everlasting He established me in the beginning, before He formed the earth, and before He made the depths, and before the springs of waters came forth, before the mountains were settled; He begets me before all the hills.' </p></blockquote>

<p>When I repeated these words, I added:</p>

<blockquote><p>You perceive, my hearers, if you bestow attention, that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has declared that this Offspring was begotten by the Father before all things created; and that which is begotten is numerically distinct from that which begets, any one will admit.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 130. He returns to the conversion of the Gentiles, and shows that it was foretold</h2>

<p>And when all had given assent, I said:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> I would now adduce some passages which I had not recounted before. They are recorded by the faithful servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, and are as follows: 'Rejoice, O you heavens, with Him, and let all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God worship Him;' <span class="stiki" id="note012458"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse43">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:43</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>And I added what follows of the passage:</p>

<blockquote><p>'Rejoice, O you nations, with His people, and let all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God be strengthened in Him: for the blood of His sons He avenges, and will avenge, and will recompense His enemies with vengeance, and will recompense those that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Him; and the Lord will purify the land of His people.' And by these words He declares that we, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with His people&mdash;to wit, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and, in short, all of that people who are well-pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to what has been already agreed on between us. But we will not receive it of all your nation; since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from Isaiah <span class="stiki" id="note012459"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse24">Isaiah&nbsp;66:24</a></span> that the members of those who have transgressed shall be consumed  by the worm and unquenchable fire, remaining <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; so that they become a spectacle to all flesh.</p>

<p>But in addition to these, I wish, sirs, to add some other passages from the very words of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, from which you may understand that God has from of old dispersed all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> according to their kindreds and tongues; and out of all kindreds has taken to Himself your kindred, a useless, disobedient, and faithless generation; and has shown that those who were selected out of every nation have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> through Christ,&mdash;whom He calls also Jacob, and names <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>&mdash;and these, then, as I mentioned fully previously, must be Jacob and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. For when He says, 'Rejoice, O you nations, with His people,' He allots the same inheritance to them, and does not call them by the same name;  but when He says that they as <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with His people, He calls them <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to reproach you. For even as you provoked Him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by your <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, so also He has deemed those who were idolaters worthy of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and of inheriting His inheritance.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 131. How much more faithful to God the Gentiles are who are converted to Christ than the Jews</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> But I shall quote the passage by which it is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that God divided all the nations. It is as follows: 'Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you; when the Most High divided the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, as He dispersed the sons of Adam. He set the bounds of the nations according to the numbers of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and the Lord's portion became His people Jacob, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was the lot of His inheritance.' </p>

<p>The Seventy have translated it, 'He set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.' But because my argument is again in nowise weakened by this, I have adopted your exposition. And you yourselves, if you will confess the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, must acknowledge that we, who have been called by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the despised and shameful <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the cross (for the confession of which, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to which, and for our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, punishments even to death have been inflicted on us by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and by the host of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, through the aid ministered to them by you), and endure all torments rather than deny Christ even by word, through whom we are called to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> prepared beforehand by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, are more faithful to God than you, who were redeemed from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with a high hand and a visitation of great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, when the sea was parted for you, and a passage left dry, in which [God] slew those who pursued you with a very great equipment, and splendid chariots, bringing back upon them the sea which had been made a way for your sakes; on whom also a pillar of light shone, in order that you, more than any other nation in the world, might possess a peculiar light, never-failing and never-setting; for whom He rained manna as nourishment, fit for the heavenly <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in order that you might have no need to prepare your food; and the water at Marah was made sweet; and a sign of Him that was to be crucified was made, both in the matter of the serpents which bit you, as I already mentioned (God anticipating before the proper times these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, in order to confer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> upon you, to whom you are always convicted of being thankless), as well as in the type of the extending of the hands of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and of Oshea being named Jesus (Joshua); when you fought against Amalek: concerning which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enjoined that the incident be recorded, and the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> laid up in your understandings; saying that this is He who would blot out the memorial of Amalek from under heaven. Now it is clear that the memorial of Amalek remained after the son of Nave (Nun): but He makes it manifest through Jesus, who was crucified, of whom also those <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> were fore-announcements of all that would happen to Him, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> would be destroyed, and would dread His name, and that all principalities and kingdoms would <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him; and that they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him out of all nations would be shown as God-fearing and peaceful men; and the facts already quoted by me, Trypho, indicate this. Again, when you desired flesh, so vast a quantity of quails was given you, that they could not be told; for whom also water gushed from the rock; and a cloud followed you for a shade from heat, and covering from cold, declaring the manner and signification of another and new heaven; the latchets of your shoes did not break, and your shoes grew not old, and your garments wore not away, but even those of the children grew along with them.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 132. How great the power was of the name of Jesus in the Old Testament</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Yet after this you made a calf, and were very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in committing fornication with the daughters of strangers, and in serving <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. And again, when the land was given up to you with so great a display of power, that you witnessed  the sun stand still in the heavens by the order of that man whose name was Jesus (Joshua), and not go down for thirty-six hours,  as well as all the other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which were wrought for you as time served;  and of these it seems good to me now to speak of another, for it conduces to your hereby <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Jesus, whom we also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have been Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who was crucified, and rose again, and ascended to heaven, and will come again to judge all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, even up to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> himself.</p>

<p>You are aware, then, that when the ark of the testimony was seized by the enemies of Ashdod,  and a terrible and incurable malady had broken out among them, they resolved to place it on a cart to which they yoked cows that had recently calved, for the purpose of ascertaining by trial whether or not they had been plagued by God's power on account of the ark, and if God wished it to be taken back to the place from which it had been carried away. And when they had done this, the cows, led by no man, went not to the place whence the ark had been taken, but to the fields of a certain man whose name was Oshea, the same as his whose name was altered to Jesus (Joshua), as has been previously mentioned, who also led the people into the land and meted it out to them: and when the cows had come into these fields they remained there, showing to you thereby that they were guided by the name of power;  just as formerly the people who survived of those that came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, were guided into the land by him who had received the name Jesus (Joshua), who before was called Oshea.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 133. The hard-heartedness of the Jews, for whom the Christians pray</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Now, although these and all other such unexpected and marvellous works were wrought among and seen by you at different times, yet you are convicted by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of having gone to such a length as offering your own children to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and besides all this, of having dared to do such things against Christ; and you still dare to do them: for all which may it be granted to you to obtain mercy and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from God and His Christ. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> before that you would do such things, pronounced this curse upon you by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah: 'Woe unto their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>! They have devised <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsel against themselves, saying, Let us bind the righteous man, for he is distasteful to us. Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own doings. Woe to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>! <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, according to the works of his hands, shall befall him. O my people, your exactors glean you, and those who extort from you shall rule over you. O my people, they who call you blessed <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, and disorder the way of your paths. But now the Lord shall assist His people to judgment, and He shall enter into judgment with the elders of the people and the princes thereof. But why have you burnt up my vineyard? And why is the spoil of the poor found in your houses? Why do you wrong my people, and put to shame the countenance of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>?' <span class="stiki" id="note012466"><a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;3:9-15</a></span> Again, in other words, the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> spoke to the same effect: 'Woe unto them that draw their iniquity as with a long cord, and their transgressions as with the harness of an heifer's yoke: who say, Let His speed come near, and let the counsel of the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> come, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. Woe unto them that call <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> good, and good <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>! That put light for darkness, and darkness for light! That put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> in their own sight! Woe unto those that are mighty among you, who drink wine, who are men of strength, who mingle strong drink! Who justify the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> for a reward, and take away <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> from the righteous! Therefore, as the stubble shall be burnt by the coal of fire, and utterly consumed by the burning flame, their root shall be as wool, and their flower shall go up like dust. For they would not have the law of the Lord of Sabaoth, but despised  the word of the Lord, the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And the Lord of Sabaoth was very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and laid His hands upon them, and smote them; and He was provoked against the mountains, and their carcasses were in the midst like dung on the road. And for all this they have not repented,  but their hand is still high.' <span class="stiki" id="note012469"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;5:18-25</a></span> For verily your hand is high to commit <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because you slew the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and do not repent of it; but so far from that, you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> us who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> through Him in the God and Father of all, as often as you can; and you curse Him without ceasing, as well as those who side with Him; while all of us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you, and for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as our Christ and Lord taught us to do, when He enjoined us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> even for our enemies, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us, and to bless them that curse us.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 134. The marriages of Jacob are a figure of the Church</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> If, then, the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and of Himself moves you, it is better for you to follow God than your imprudent and blind masters, who even till this time permit each man to have four or five wives; and if any one see a beautiful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and desire to have her, they quote the doings of Jacob [called] <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and of the other  patriarchs, and maintain that it is not wrong to do such things; for they are miserably <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> in this matter. For, as I before said, certain dispensations of weighty <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> were accomplished in each act of this sort. For in the marriages of Jacob I shall mention what dispensation and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> were accomplished, in order that you may thereby <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your teachers never looked at the divine motive which prompted each act, but only at the grovelling and corrupting <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Attend therefore to what I say. The marriages of Jacob were types of that which Christ was about to accomplish. For it was not lawful for Jacob to marry two sisters at once. And he serves Laban for [one of] the daughters; and being deceived in [the obtaining of] the younger, he again served seven years. Now Leah is your people and <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>; but Rachel is our Church. And for these, and for the servants in both, Christ even now serves. For while <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> gave to the two sons the seed of the third as servants, now on the other hand Christ has come to restore both the free sons and the servants among them, conferring the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> on all of them who keep His commandments; even as the children of the free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and the children of the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> born to Jacob were all sons, and equal in dignity. And it was foretold what each should be according to rank and according to fore-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Jacob served Laban for speckled and many-spotted sheep; and Christ served, even to the slavery of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, for the various and many-formed races of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, acquiring them by the blood and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the cross. Leah was weak-eyed; for the eyes of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are excessively weak. Rachel stole the gods of Laban, and has hid them to this day; and we have lost our paternal and material gods. Jacob was <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> for all time by his brother; and we now, and our Lord Himself, are <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by you and by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, though we are brothers by nature. Jacob was called <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has been demonstrated to be the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, who is, and is called, Jesus.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 135. Christ is king of Israel, and Christians are the Israelitic race</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And when <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, 'I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> your King,' <span class="stiki" id="note012470"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;43:15</a></span> will you not understand that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Christ is the everlasting King? For you are aware that Jacob the son of Isaac was never a king. And therefore Scripture again, explaining to us, says what king is meant by Jacob and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: 'Jacob is my Servant, I will uphold Him; and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is my Elect, my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall receive Him. I have given Him my Spirit; and He shall bring forth judgment to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. He shall not cry, and His voice shall not be heard without. The bruised reed He shall not break, and the smoking flax He shall not quench, until He shall bring forth judgment to victory. He shall shine, and shall not be broken, until He set judgment on the earth. And in His name shall the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> trust.' <span class="stiki" id="note012471"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;42:1-4</a></span> Then is it Jacob the patriarch in whom the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and yourselves shall trust? Or is it not Christ? As, therefore, Christ is the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and the Jacob, even so we, who have been quarried out from the bowels of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Israelitic race. But let us attend rather to the very word: 'And I will bring forth,' He says, 'the seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah: and it shall inherit My <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain; and Mine Elect and My servants shall possess the inheritance, and shall dwell there; and there shall be folds of flocks in the thicket, and the valley of Achor shall be a resting-place of cattle for the people who have sought Me. But as for you, who forsake Me, and forget My <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain, and prepare a table for <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and fill out drink for the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, I shall give you to the sword. You shall all fall with a slaughter; for I called you, and you hearkened not, and did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before me, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.' <span class="stiki" id="note012472"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;65:9-12</a></span> Such are the words of Scripture; understand, therefore, that the seed of Jacob now referred to is something else, and not, as may be supposed, spoken of your people. For it is not possible for the seed of Jacob to leave an entrance for the descendants of Jacob, or for [God] to have accepted the very same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom He had reproached with unfitness for the inheritance, and promise it to them again; but as there the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, 'And now, O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of the Lord; for He has sent away His people, the house of Jacob, because their land was full, as at the first, of soothsayers and divinations;'  even so it is necessary for us here to observe that there are two seeds of Judah, and two races, as there are two houses of Jacob: the one begotten by blood and flesh, the other by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the Spirit.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 136. The Jews, in rejecting Christ, rejected God who sent him</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For you see how He now addresses the people, saying a little before: 'As the grape shall be found in the cluster, and they will say, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it; so will I do for My servant's sake: for His sake I will not destroy them all.'  And thereafter He adds: 'And I shall bring forth the seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah.' It is plain then that if He thus be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them, and threaten to leave very few  of them, He promises to bring forth certain others, who shall dwell in His mountain. But these are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom He said He would sow and beget. For you neither suffer Him when He calls you, nor hear Him when He speaks to you, but have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the presence of the Lord. But the highest pitch of your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> lies in this, that you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the Righteous One, and slew Him; and so treat those who have received from Him all that they are and have, and who are <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, righteous, and humane. Therefore 'woe unto their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,' says the Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note012475"><a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;3:9</a></span> 'for they have devised an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsel against themselves, saying, Let us take away the righteous, for he is distasteful to us.' For indeed you are not in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, as were your fathers, or of placing cakes in groves and on high places for the <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">host</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: but you have not accepted God's Christ. For he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not Him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and he who insults and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> Him, insults and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> Him that sent Him. And whoever believes not in Him, believes not the declarations of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who preached and proclaimed Him to all.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 137. He exhorts the Jews to be converted</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Say no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing, my brothers, against Him that was crucified, and treat not scornfully the stripes wherewith all may be healed, even as we are healed. For it will be well if, persuaded by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, you are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> from hard-heartedness: not that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> which you have from the tenets that are put into you; for that was given for a sign, and not for a work of righteousness, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> compel you [to admit]. Assent, therefore, and pour no ridicule on the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> not the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisaic</a> teachers, and scoff not at the King of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as the rulers of your <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> teach you to do after your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>: for if he that touches those who are not pleasing <span class="stiki" id="note012476"><a href="../bible/zec002.htm#verse8">Zechariah&nbsp;2:8</a></span> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is as one that touches the apple of God's eye, how much more so is he that touches His beloved! And that this is He, has been sufficiently demonstrated.</p></blockquote>

<p>And as they kept silence, I continued:</p>

<blockquote><p>My friends, I now refer to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> as the Seventy have interpreted them; for when I quoted them formerly as you possess them, I made <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of you [to ascertain] how you were disposed.  For, mentioning the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> which says, 'Woe unto them! For they have devised <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsel against themselves, saying' <span class="stiki" id="note012478"><a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;3:9</a></span> (as the Seventy have translated, I continued): 'Let us take away the righteous, for he is distasteful to us;' whereas at the commencement of the discussion I added what your version has: 'Let us bind the righteous, for he is distasteful to us.' But you had been busy about some other matter, and seem to have listened to the words without attending to them. But now, since the day is drawing to a close, for the sun is about to set, I shall add one remark to what I have said, and conclude. I have indeed made the very same remark already, but I think it would be right to bestow some consideration on it again.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 138. Noah is a figure of Christ, who has regenerated us by water, and faith, and wood: [i.e., <em>the cross</em>.]</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, then, sirs, that God has said in Isaiah to Jerusalem: 'I saved you in the deluge of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>.'  By this which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said was meant that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of saved men appeared in the deluge. For righteous <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, along with the other mortals at the deluge, i.e., with his own wife, his three sons and their wives, being eight in number, were a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the eighth day, wherein Christ appeared when He rose from the dead, for ever the first in power. For Christ, being the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature, became again the chief of another race regenerated by Himself through water, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and wood, containing the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the cross; even as <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> was saved by wood when he rode over the waters with his household. Accordingly, when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, 'I saved you in the times of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>,' as I have already remarked, he addresses the people who are equally faithful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and possess the same signs. For when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had the rod in his hands, he led your nation through the sea. And you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this was spoken to your nation only, or to the land. But the whole earth, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, was inundated, and the water rose in height fifteen cubits above all the mountains: so that it is evident this was not spoken to the land, but to the people who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> Him: for whom also He had before prepared a resting-place in Jerusalem, as was previously demonstrated by all the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of the deluge; I mean, that by water, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and wood, those who are afore-prepared, and who repent of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which they have committed, shall escape from the impending judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 139. The blessings, and also the curse, pronounced by Noah were prophecies of the future</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For another <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was accomplished and predicted in the days of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, of which you are  not aware. It is this: in the blessings wherewith <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> blessed his two sons, and in the curse pronounced on his son's son. For the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> would not curse the son that had been by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> blessed along with [his brothers]. But since the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would cleave to the whole descent of the son that mocked at his father's nakedness, he made the curse originate with <em>his</em> son.  Now, in what he said, he foretold that the descendants of <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a> would keep in retention the property and dwellings of Canaan: and again that the descendants of Japheth would take possession of the property of which <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem's</a> descendants had dispossessed Canaan's descendants; and spoil the descendants of <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>, even as they plundered the sons of Canaan. And listen to the way in which it has so come to pass. For you, who have derived your lineage from <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>, invaded the territory of the sons of Canaan by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and you possessed it. And it is manifest that the sons of Japheth, having invaded you in turn by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have taken your land from you, and have possessed it. Thus it is written: 'And <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> awoke from the wine, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what his younger son had done unto him; and he said, Cursed be Canaan, the servant; a servant shall he be unto his brethren. And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>; and Canaan shall be his servant. May the Lord enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the houses of <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>; and let Canaan be his servant.' <span class="stiki" id="note012481"><a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;9:24-27</a></span> Accordingly, as two peoples were blessed,&mdash;those from <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>, and those from Japheth,&mdash;and as the offspring of <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a> were decreed first to possess the dwellings of Canaan, and the offspring of Japheth were predicted as in turn receiving the same possessions, and to the two peoples there was the one people of Canaan handed over for servants; so Christ has come according to the power given Him from the Almighty Father, and summoning men to friendship, and blessing, and repentance, and dwelling together, has promised, as has already been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, that there shall be a future possession for all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in this same land. And hence all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> everywhere, whether bond or free, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and recognise the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in His own words and those of His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they shall be with Him in that land, and inherit everlasting and incorruptible good.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 140. In Christ all are free. The Jews hope for salvation in vain because they are sons of Abraham</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Hence also Jacob, as I remarked before, being himself a type of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, had married the two handmaids of his two free wives, and of them begot sons, for the purpose of indicating beforehand that Christ would receive even all those who among Japheth's race are descendants of Canaan, equally with the free, and would have the children fellow-heirs. And we are such; but you cannot comprehend this, because you cannot drink of the living fountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but of broken cisterns which can hold no water, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says. <span class="stiki" id="note012482"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse13">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:13</a></span> But they are cisterns broken, and holding no water, which your own teachers have dug, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> also expressly asserts, 'teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.' <span class="stiki" id="note012483"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13</a></span> And besides, they beguile themselves and you, supposing that the everlasting kingdom will be assuredly given to those of the dispersion who are of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> after the flesh, although they be sinners, and faithless, and disobedient towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> is not the case. For if so, Isaiah would never have said this: 'And unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we would have been like <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note012484"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;1:9</a></span> And Ezekiel: 'Even if <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and Jacob, and Daniel were to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for sons or daughters, their request should not be granted.'  'But neither shall the father perish for the son, nor the son for the father; but every one for his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and each shall be saved for his own righteousness.' <span class="stiki" id="note012486"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse20">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:20</a></span> And again Isaiah says: 'They shall look on the carcasses  of them that have transgressed: their worm shall not cease, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh.' <span class="stiki" id="note012488"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse24">Isaiah&nbsp;66:24</a></span> And our Lord, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent Him, who is the Father and Lord of all, would not have said, 'They shall come from the east, and from the west, and shall sit down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.'  Furthermore, I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in what has preceded,  that those who were foreknown to be unrighteous, whether men or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, are not made <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> by God's fault, but each man by his own fault is what he will appear to be.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 141. Free-will in men and angels</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> But that you may not have a pretext for saying that Christ must have been crucified, and that those who transgressed must have been among your nation, and that the matter could not have been otherwise, I said briefly by anticipation,  that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wishing men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to follow His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, resolved to create them free to do righteousness; possessing reason, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by whom they are created, and through whom they, not existing formerly, do now exist; and with a law that they should be judged by Him, if they do anything contrary to right reason: and of ourselves we, men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, shall be convicted of having acted sinfully, unless we repent beforehand. But if the word of God foretells that some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men shall be certainly punished, it did so because it foreknew that they would be unchangeably [<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>], but not because God had created them so. So that if they repent, all who wish for it can obtain mercy from God: and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> foretells that they shall be blessed, saying, 'Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;'  that is, having repented of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that he may receive remission of them from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and not as you deceive yourselves, and some others who resemble you in this, who say, that even though they be sinners, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Lord will not impute <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to them. We have as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this the one fall of David, which happened through his boasting, which was forgiven then when he so mourned and wept, as it is written. But if even to such a man no remission was granted before repentance, and only when this great king, and anointed one, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, mourned and conducted himself so, how can the impure and utterly abandoned, if they weep not, and mourn not, and repent not, entertain the hope that the Lord will not impute to them <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</p>

<p>And this one fall of David, in the matter of Uriah's wife, proves, sirs, that the patriarchs had many wives, not to commit fornication, but that a certain dispensation and all <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> might be accomplished by them; since, if it were allowable to take any wife, or as many wives as one chooses, and how he chooses, which the men of your nation do over all the earth, wherever they sojourn, or wherever they have been sent, taking <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> under the name of marriage, much more would David have been permitted to do this.</p></blockquote>

<p>When I had said this, dearest Marcus Pompeius, I came to an end.</p>

<h2>Chapter 142. The Jews return thanks, and leave Justin</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> <em>(After a little delay.)</em> You see that it was not intentionally that we came to discuss these points. And I confess that I have been particularly pleased with the conference; and I think that these are of quite the same opinion as myself. For we have found more than we expected, and more than it was possible to have expected. And if we could do this more frequently, we should be much helped in the searching of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves. But since you are on the eve of departure, and expect daily to set sail, do not hesitate to remember us as friends when you are gone.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> For my part, if I had remained, I would have wished to do the same thing daily. But now, since I expect, with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and aid, to set sail, I exhort you to give all diligence in this very great struggle for your own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and to be earnest in setting a higher value on the Christ of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> than on your own teachers.</p></blockquote>

<p>After this they left me, wishing me safety in my voyage, and from every misfortune. And I, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for them, said, <q>I can wish no better thing for you, sirs, than this, that, recognising in this way that intelligence is given to every man, you may be of the same opinion as ourselves, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>
