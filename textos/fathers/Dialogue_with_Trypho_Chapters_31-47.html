<h1>Dialogue with Trypho (Chapters 31-47)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 31. If Christ's power be now so great, how much greater at the second advent!</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> But if so great a power is shown to have followed and to be still following the dispensation of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a>, how great shall that be which shall follow His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> advent! For He shall come on the clouds as the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, so Daniel foretold, and His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> shall come with Him. These are the words: 'I beheld till the thrones were set; and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool. His throne was like a fiery flame, His wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him. Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The books were opened, and the judgment was set. I beheld then the voice of the great words which the horn speaks: and the beast was beat down, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. And the rest of the beasts were taken away from their dominion, and a period of life was given to the beasts until a season and time. I saw in the vision of the night, and, behold, one like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming with the clouds of heaven; and He came to the Ancient of days, and stood before Him. And they who stood by brought Him near; and there were given Him power and kingly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and all nations of the earth by their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, serve Him. And His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not be taken away; and His kingdom shall not be destroyed. And my spirit was chilled within my frame, and the visions of my head troubled me. I came near unto one of them that stood by, and inquired the precise meaning of all these things. In answer he speaks to me, and showed me the judgment of the matters: These great beasts are four kingdoms, which shall perish from the earth, and shall not receive dominion for ever, even for ever and ever. Then I wished to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> exactly about the fourth beast, which destroyed all [the others] and was very terrible, its teeth of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, made waste, and stamped the residue with its feet: also about the ten horns upon its head, and of the one which came up, by means of which three of the former fell. And that horn had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things; and its countenance excelled the  rest. And I beheld that horn waging <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and prevailing against them, until the Ancient of days came; and He gave judgment for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the Most High. And the time came, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the Most High possessed the kingdom. And it was told me concerning the fourth beast: There shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall prevail over all these kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall destroy and make it thoroughly waste. And the ten horns are ten kings that shall arise; and one shall arise after them;  and he shall surpass the first in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, and he shall subdue three kings, and he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall overthrow the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the Most High, and shall expect to change the seasons and the times. And it shall be delivered into his hands for a time, and times, and half a time. And the judgment sat, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. And the kingdom, and the power, and the great places of the kingdoms under the heavens, were given to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people of the Most High, to reign in an everlasting kingdom: and all powers shall be subject to Him, and shall <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him. Hitherto is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was possessed with a very great astonishment, and my speech was changed in me; yet I kept the matter in my heart.' <span class="stiki" id="note012028"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse9">Daniel&nbsp;7:9-28</a></span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 32. Trypho objecting that Christ is described as glorious by Daniel, Justin distinguishes two advents</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> These and such like Scriptures, sir, compel us to wait for Him who, as <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, receives from the Ancient of days the everlasting kingdom. But this so-called Christ of yours was dishonourable and inglorious, so much so that the last curse contained in the law of God fell on him, for he was crucified.</p></blockquote>

<p><blockquote><strong>Justin:</strong> If, sirs, it were not said by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which I have already quoted, that His form was inglorious, and His generation not declared, and that for His death the rich would suffer death, and with His stripes we should be healed, and that He would be led away like a sheep; and if I had not explained that there would be two advents of His&mdash;one in which He was pierced by you; a second, when you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him whom you have pierced, and your tribes shall mourn, each tribe by itself, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> apart, and the men apart&mdash;then I must have been speaking dubious and obscure things. But now, by means of the contents of those Scriptures esteemed <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and prophetic among you, I attempt to prove all [that I have adduced], in the hope that some one of you may be found to be of that remnant which has been left by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord of Sabaoth for the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. In order, therefore, that the matter inquired into may be plainer to you, I will mention to you other words also spoken by the blessed David, from which you will perceive that the Lord is called the Christ by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; and that the Lord, the Father of all, has brought Him again from the earth, setting Him at His own right hand, until He makes His enemies His footstool; which indeed happens from the time that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> ascended to heaven, after He rose again from the dead, the times now running on to their consummation; and he whom Daniel foretells would have dominion for a time, and times, and an half, is even already at the door, about to speak <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and daring things against the Most High. But you, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of how long he will have dominion, hold another opinion. For you interpret the 'time' as being a hundred years. But if this is so, the man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> must, at the shortest, reign three hundred and fifty years, in order that we may compute that which is said by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Daniel&mdash;'and times'&mdash;to be <em>two</em> times only. All this I have said to you in digression, in order that you at length may be persuaded of what has been declared against you by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you are foolish sons; and of this, 'Therefore, behold, I will proceed to take away this people, and shall take them away; and I will strip the wise of their wisdom, and will hide the understanding of their <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> men.' <span class="stiki" id="note012029"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;29:14</a></span> and may cease to deceive yourselves and those who hear you, and may learn of us, who have been taught wisdom by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The words, then, which were spoken by David, are these: </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>The Lord said unto My Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool. The Lord shall send the rod of Your strength out of Sion: rule also in the midst of Your enemies. With You shall be, in the day, the chief of Your power, in the beauties of Your <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. From the womb, before the morning star, have I begotten You. The Lord has <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, and will not repent: You are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>. The Lord is at Your right hand: He has crushed kings in the day of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: He shall judge among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, He shall fill [with] the dead bodies.  He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall He lift up the head.'</em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 33. Psalm 110 is not spoken of Hezekiah. He proves that Christ was first humble, then shall be glorious</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And I am not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that you venture to expound this psalm as if it referred to king Hezekiah; but that you are mistaken, I shall prove to you from these very words immediately. 'The Lord has <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, and will not repent,' it is said; and, 'You are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> forever, after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>,' with what follows and precedes. Not even you will venture to object that Hezekiah was either a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or is the everlasting <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but that this is spoken of our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, these expressions show. But your ears are shut up, and your hearts are made dull.  For by this statement, 'The Lord has <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, and will not repent: You are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever, after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>,' with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> God has shown Him (on account of your unbelief) to be the High Priest after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>; i.e., as <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a> was described by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Most High, and he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of those who were in uncircumcision, and blessed the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> who brought him <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, so God has shown that His everlasting Priest, called also by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Lord, would be Priest of those in uncircumcision. Those too in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> who approach Him, that is, believing Him and seeking blessings from Him, He will both receive and bless. And that He shall be first <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and then exalted, these words at the end of the Psalm show: 'He shall drink of the brook in the way,' and then, 'Therefore shall He lift up the head.'</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 34. Nor does Psalm 72 apply to Solomon, whose faults Christians shudder at</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Further, to persuade you that you have not understood anything of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, I will remind you of another psalm, dictated to David by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which you say refers to Solomon, who was also your king. But it refers also to our Christ. But you deceive yourselves by the ambiguous forms of speech. For where it is said, 'The law of the Lord is perfect,' you do not understand it of the law which was to be after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but of the law which was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, although God declared that He would establish a new law and a new covenant. And where it has been said, 'O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, give Your judgment to the king,' since Solomon was king, you say that the Psalm refers to him, although the words of the Psalm expressly proclaim that reference is made to the everlasting King, i.e., to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For Christ is King, and Priest, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Lord, and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and man, and captain, and stone, and a Son born, and first made subject to suffering, then returning to heaven, and again coming with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and He is preached as having the everlasting kingdom: so I prove from all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. But that you may perceive what I have said, I quote the words of the Psalm; they are these:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, give Your judgment to the king, and Your righteousness unto the king's son, to judge Your people with righteousness, and Your poor with judgment. The mountains shall take up peace to the people, and the little hills righteousness. He shall judge the poor of the people, and shall save the children of the needy, and shall abase the slanderer. He shall co-endure with the sun, and before the moon unto all generations. He shall come down like rain upon the fleece, as drops falling on the earth. In His days shall righteousness flourish, and abundance of peace until the moon be taken away. And He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the rivers unto the ends of the earth. <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> shall fall down before Him, and His enemies shall lick the dust. The kings of Tarshish and the isles shall offer gifts; the kings of Arabia and Seba shall offer gifts; and all the kings of the earth shall worship Him, and all the nations shall serve Him: for He has delivered the poor from the man of power, and the needy that has no helper. He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the needy: He shall redeem their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and His name shall be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> before them. And He shall live, and to Him shall be given of the gold of Arabia, and they shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> continually for Him: they shall bless Him all the day. And there shall be a foundation on the earth, it shall be exalted on the tops of the mountains: His fruit shall be on Lebanon, and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. His name shall be blessed for ever. His name shall endure before the sun; and all tribes of the earth shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in Him, all nations shall call Him blessed. Blessed be the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who only does wondrous things; and blessed be His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> name for ever, and for ever and ever; and the whole earth shall be filled with His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>. </em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>And at the close of this Psalm which I have quoted, it is written, 'The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of David the son of Jesse are ended.'  Moreover, that Solomon was a renowned and great king, by whom the temple called that at Jerusalem was built, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but that none of those things mentioned in the Psalm happened to him, is evident. For neither did all kings worship him; nor did he reign to the ends of the earth; nor did his enemies, falling before him, lick the dust. Nay, also, I venture to repeat what is  written in the book of Kings as committed by him, how through a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> influence he worshipped the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of Sidon, which those of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Maker of all things through Jesus the crucified, do not venture to do, but abide every torture and vengeance even to the extremity of death, rather than worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, or eat meat offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 35. Heretics confirm the Catholics in the faith</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, however, that many of those who say that they confess <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and are called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, eat meats offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and declare that they are by no means injured in consequence.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> The fact that there are such men confessing themselves to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and admitting the crucified Jesus to be both Lord and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, yet not teaching His doctrines, but those of the spirits of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, causes us who are <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and pure doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, to be more faithful and steadfast in the hope announced by Him. For what things He predicted would take place in His name, these we do see being actually accomplished in our sight. For he said, 'Many shall come in My name, clothed outwardly in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.' <span class="stiki" id="note012035"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;7:15</a></span> And, 'There shall be schisms and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note012036"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:19</a></span> And, 'Beware of <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, who shall come to you clothed outwardly in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.' <span class="stiki" id="note012037"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;7:15</a></span> And, 'Many false Christs and false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> shall arise, and shall deceive many of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note012038"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;24:11</a></span> There are, therefore, and there were many, my friends, who, coming forward in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, taught both to speak and act impious and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> things; and these are called by us after the name of the men from whom each doctrine and opinion had its origin. (For some in one way, others in another, teach to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the Maker of all things, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was foretold by Him as coming, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, with whom we have nothing in common, since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them to be <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a>, impious, unrighteous, and sinful, and confessors of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in name only, instead of worshippers of Him. Yet they style themselves <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, just as certain among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> inscribe the name of God upon the works of their own hands, and partake in nefarious and impious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>.) Some are called Marcians, and some <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilidians</a>, and some Saturnilians, and others by other names; each called after the originator of the individual opinion, just as each one of those who consider themselves <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, as I said before, thinks he must bear the name of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which he follows, from the name of the father of the particular doctrine. So that, in consequence of these events, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> foreknew what would happen after Him, as well as in consequence of many other events which He foretold would befall those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on and confessed Him, the Christ. For all that we suffer, even when killed by friends, He foretold would take place; so that it is manifest no word or act of His can be found fault with. Wherefore we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you and for all other men who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us; in order that you, having repented along with us, may not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Him who, by His works, by the mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> even now wrought through His name, by the words He taught, by the prophecies announced concerning Him, is the blameless, and in all things irreproachable, Christ Jesus; but, believing on Him, may be saved in His second <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> advent, and may not be condemned to fire by Him.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 36. He proves that Christ is called Lord of Hosts</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Let these things be so as you say&mdash;namely, that it was foretold Christ would suffer, and be called a stone; and after His first appearance, in which it had been announced He would suffer, would come in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and be Judge finally of all, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> King and Priest. Now show if this man be He of whom these prophecies were made.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> As you wish, Trypho, I shall come to these <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> which you seek in the fitting place; but now you will permit me first to recount the prophecies, which I wish to do in order to prove that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called both God and Lord of hosts, and Jacob, in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and your interpreters, as God says, are foolish, since they say that reference is made to Solomon and not to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when he bore the ark of testimony into the temple which he built. The Psalm of David is this:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and all that dwell therein. He has rounded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon the floods. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place? He that is clean of hands and pure of heart: who has not received his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in vain, and has not <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> guilefully to his neighbour: he shall receive blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Saviour. This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, that seek the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob.  Lift up your gates, you rulers; and be lifted up, you everlasting doors; and the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall come in. Who is this King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? The Lord strong and mighty in battle. Lift up your gates, you rulers;  and be lifted up, you everlasting doors; and the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall come in. Who is this King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. </em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Accordingly, it is shown that Solomon is not the Lord of hosts; but when our Christ rose from the dead and ascended to heaven, the rulers in heaven, under appointment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are commanded to open the gates of heaven, that He who is King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may enter in, and having ascended, may sit on the right hand of the Father until He make the enemies His footstool, as has been made manifest by another Psalm. For when the rulers of heaven saw Him of uncomely and dishonoured appearance, and inglorious, not recognising Him, they inquired, 'Who is this King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?' And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, either from the person of His Father, or from His own person, answers them, 'The Lord of hosts, He is this King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.' For every one will confess that not one of those who presided over the gates of the temple at Jerusalem would venture to say concerning Solomon, though he was so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> a king, or concerning the ark of testimony, 'Who is this King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?'</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 37. The same is proved from other Psalms</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Moreover, in the diapsalm of the forty-sixth Psalm, reference is thus made to Christ: 'God went up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet. Sing to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sing: sing to our King, sing; for God is King of all the earth: sing with understanding. God has ruled over the nations. God sits upon His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> throne. The rulers of the nations were assembled along with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, for the strong ones of God are greatly exalted on the earth.'  And in the ninety-eighth Psalm, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> reproaches you, and predicts Him whom you do not wish to be king to be King and Lord, both of Samuel, and of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and, in short, of all the others. And the words of the Psalm are these:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>The Lord has reigned, let the nations be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: [it is] He who sits upon the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, let the earth be shaken. The Lord is great in Zion, and He is high above all the nations. Let them confess Your great name, for it is fearful and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the King loves judgment. You have prepared equity; judgment and righteousness have You performed in Jacob. Exalt the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and worship the footstool of His feet; for He is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> among His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and Samuel among those who call upon His name. They called (says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>) on the Lord, and He heard them. In the pillar of the cloud He spoke to them; for  they kept His testimonies, and the commandment which he gave them. O Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, You heard them: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, You were propitious to them, and [yet] taking vengeance on all their inventions. Exalt the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and worship at His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hill; for the Lord our God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. </em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 38. It is an annoyance to the Jew that Christ is said to be adored. Justin confirms it, however, from Psalm 45</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Sir, it were good for us if we <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> our teachers, who laid down a law that we should have no intercourse with any of you, and that we should not have even any communication with you on these questions. For you utter many <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, in that you seek to persuade us that this crucified man was with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud; then that he became man, was crucified, and ascended up to heaven, and comes again to earth, and ought to be worshipped.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, as the word of God says, this great wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Maker of all things, and the Almighty, is hid from you. Wherefore, in sympathy with you, I am striving to the utmost that you may understand these matters which to you are paradoxical; but if not, that I myself may be innocent in the day of judgment. For you shall hear other words which appear still more paradoxical; but be not confounded, nay, rather remain still more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> hearers and investigators, despising the tradition of your teachers, since they are convicted by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of inability to perceive the truths taught by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of preferring to teach their own doctrines. Accordingly, in the forty-fourth [forty-fifth] Psalm, these words are in like manner referred to Christ:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>My heart has brought forth a good matter;  I tell my works to the King. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer. Fairer in beauty than the sons of men: <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is poured forth into Your lips: therefore has God blessed You for ever. Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O mighty One. Press on in Your fairness and in Your beauty, and prosper and reign, because of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and of meekness, and of righteousness: and Your right hand shall instruct You marvellously. Your arrows are sharpened, O mighty One; the people shall fall under You; in the heart of the enemies of the King [the arrows are fixed]. Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of equity  is the sceptre of Your kingdom. You have loved righteousness, and have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity; therefore your God  has anointed You with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above Your fellows. [He has anointed You] with myrrh,  and oil, and cassia, from Your garments; from the ivory palaces, whereby they made You glad. King's daughters are in Your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The queen stood at Your right hand, clad in garments  embroidered with gold. Hearken, O daughter, and behold, and incline your ear, and forget your people and the house of your father: and the King shall desire your beauty; because He is your Lord, they shall worship Him also. And the daughter of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> [shall be there] with gifts. The rich of the people shall entreat Your face. All the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the King's daughter [is] within, clad in embroidered garments of needlework. The <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> that follow her shall be brought to the King; her neighbours shall be brought unto You: they shall be brought with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>: they shall be led into the King's shrine. Instead of your fathers, your sons have been born: You shall appoint them rulers over all the earth. I shall remember Your name in every generation: therefore the people shall confess You for ever, and for ever and ever.'</em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 39. The Jews hate the Christians who believe this. How great the distinction is between both!</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Now it is not surprising, that you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us who hold these opinions, and convict you of a continual hardness of heart.  For indeed Elijah, conversing with God concerning you, speaks thus: 'Lord, they have slain Your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and dug down Your altars: and I am left alone, and they seek my life.' And He answers him: 'I have still seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>.'  Therefore, just as God did not inflict His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> on account of those seven thousand men, even so He has now neither yet inflicted judgment, nor does inflict it, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that daily some [of you] are becoming <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and quitting the path of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; who are also receiving gifts, each as he is worthy, illumined through the name of this Christ. For one receives the spirit of understanding, another of counsel, another of strength, another of healing, another of foreknowledge, another of teaching, and another of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> I wish you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that you are beside yourself, talking these sentiments.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Listen, O friend,  for I am not mad or beside myself; but it was prophesied that, after the ascent of Christ to heaven, He would deliver  us from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and give us gifts. The words are these: 'He ascended up on high; He led captivity captive; He gave gifts to men.'  Accordingly, we who have received gifts from Christ, who has ascended up on high, prove from the words of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> that you, 'the wise in yourselves, and the men of understanding in your own eyes,' <span class="stiki" id="note012053"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse21">Isaiah&nbsp;5:21</a></span> are foolish, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> God and His Christ by lip only. But we, who are instructed in the whole <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,  <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Them both in acts, and in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and in heart, even unto death. But you hesitate to confess that He is Christ, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and the events witnessed and done in His name prove, perhaps for this reason, lest you be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the rulers, who, under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and deceitful spirit, the serpent, will not cease putting to death and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> those who confess the name of Christ until He come again, and destroy them all, and render to each his deserts.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Now, then, render us the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that this man who you say was crucified and ascended into heaven is the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For you have sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by means of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> previously quoted by you, that it is declared in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that Christ must suffer, and come again with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and receive the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom over all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, every kingdom being made subject to Him: now show us that this man is He.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> It has been already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, sirs, to those who have ears, even from the facts which have been conceded by you; but that you may not think me at a loss, and unable to give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of what you ask, as I promised, I shall do so at a fitting place. At present, I resume the consideration of the subject which I was discussing.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 40. He returns to the Mosaic laws, and proves that they were figures of the things which pertain to Christ</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, then, of the lamb which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enjoined to be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> as the passover, was a type of Christ; with whose blood, in proportion to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him, they anoint their houses, i.e., themselves, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. For that the creation which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created&mdash;to wit, Adam&mdash;was a house for the spirit which proceeded from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you all can understand. And that  this injunction was temporary, I prove thus. God does not permit the lamb of the passover to be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> in any other place than where His name was named; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the days will come, after the suffering of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when even the place in Jerusalem shall be given over to your enemies, and all the offerings, in short, shall cease; and that lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb,  which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb. And the two goats which were ordered to be offered during the fast, of which one was sent away as the scape [goat], and the other <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, were similarly declarative of the two appearances of Christ: the first, in which the elders of your people, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, having laid hands on Him and put Him to death, sent Him away as the scape [goat]; and His second appearance, because in the same place in Jerusalem you shall recognise Him whom you have dishonoured, and who was an offering for all sinners willing to repent, and keeping the fast which Isaiah speaks of, loosening the terms  of the violent contracts, and keeping the other precepts, likewise enumerated by him, and which I have quoted,  which those believing in Jesus do. And further, you are aware that the offering of the two goats, which were enjoined to be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> at the fast, was not permitted to take place similarly anywhere else, but only in Jerusalem.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 41. The oblation of fine flour was a figure of the Eucharist</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And the offering of fine flour, sirs, which was prescribed to be presented on behalf of those purified from <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, was a type of the bread of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, the celebration of which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> prescribed, in remembrance of the suffering which He endured on behalf of those who are purified in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from all iniquity, in order that we may at the same time thank God for having created the world, with all things therein, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and for delivering us from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in which we were, and for utterly overthrowing  principalities and powers by Him who suffered according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Hence God speaks by the mouth of Malachi, one of the twelve [<a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>], as I said before,  about the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> at that time presented by you: 'I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord; and I will not accept your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> at your hands: for, from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, My name has been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and in every place <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> is offered to My name, and a pure offering: for My name is great among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, says the Lord: but you profane it.' <span class="stiki" id="note012060"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse10">Malachi&nbsp;1:10-12</a></span> [So] He then speaks of those <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, namely us, who in every place offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to Him, i.e., the bread of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, and also the cup of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, affirming both that we glorify His name, and that you profane [it]. The command of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, again, bidding [them] always circumcise the children on the eighth day, was a type of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, by which we are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> from deceit and iniquity through Him who rose from the dead on the first day after the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, [namely through] <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. For the first day after the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, remaining the first  of all the days, is called, however, the eighth, according to the number of all the days of the cycle, and [yet] remains the first.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 42. The bells on the priest's robe were a figure of the apostles</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Moreover, the prescription that twelve bells  be attached to the [robe] of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, which hung down to the feet, was a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who depend on the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Priest; and through their voice it is that all the earth has been filled with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of His Christ. Wherefore David also says: 'Their sound has gone forth into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.'  And Isaiah speaks as if he were personating the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, when they say to Christ that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not in their own report, but in the power of Him who sent them. And so he says: 'Lord, who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have preached before Him as if [He were] a child, as if a root in a dry ground.' <span class="stiki" id="note012064"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;53:1-2</a></span> (And what follows in order of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> already quoted. ) But when the passage speaks as from the lips of many, 'We have preached before Him,' and adds, 'as if a child,' it signifies that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall become subject to Him, and shall <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> His command, and that all shall become as one child. Such a thing as you may <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in the body: although the members are enumerated as many, all are called <em>one</em>, and are a <em>body</em>. For, indeed, a commonwealth and a church,  though many individuals in number,  are in fact as one, called and addressed by one appellation. And in short, sirs, by enumerating all the other appointments of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> I can demonstrate that they were types, and <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>, and declarations of those things which would happen to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of those who it was foreknown were to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, and of those things which would also be done by Christ Himself. But since what I have now enumerated appears to me to be sufficient, I revert again to the order of the discourse. </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 43. He concludes that the law had an end in Christ, who was born of the Virgin</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> As, then, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> began with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and offerings and feasts with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and it has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> they were enjoined on account of the hardness of your people's heart, so it was necessary, in accordance with the Father's will, that they should have an end in Him who was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, and of David; in Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who was proclaimed as about to come to all the world, to be the everlasting law and the everlasting covenant, even as the forementioned prophecies show. And we, who have approached God through Him, have received not carnal, but spiritual <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> and those like him observed. And we have received it through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, since we were sinners, by God's mercy; and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> may equally obtain it. But since the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His birth now demands our attention I shall speak of it. Isaiah then asserted in regard to the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that it could not be declared by man, in words already quoted:  'Who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth: for the transgressions of my people was He led  to death.' <span class="stiki" id="note012070"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;53:8</a></span> The Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> thus affirmed that the generation of Him who was to die, that we sinful men might be healed by His stripes, was such as could not be declared. Furthermore, that the men who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him may possess the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the manner in which He came into the world,  the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> by the same Isaiah foretold how it would happen thus:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>And the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying, Ask for yourself a sign from the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the depth, or in the height. And Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. And Isaiah said, Hear then, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to contend with men, and how do you contend with the Lord? Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and his name shall be called Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, before he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> or prefers the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and chooses out the good;  for before the child <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> good or ill, he rejects <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>  by choosing out the good. For before the child <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to call father or mother, he shall receive the power of Damascus and the spoil of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> in presence of the king of Assyria. And the land shall be forsaken,  which you shall with difficulty endure in consequence of the presence of its two kings.  But God shall bring on you, and on your people, and on the house of your father, days which have not yet come upon you since the day in which Ephraim took away from Judah the king of Assyria. </em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Now it is evident to all, that in the race of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> according to the flesh no one has been born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, or is said to have been born [of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>], save this our Christ. But since you and your teachers venture to affirm that in the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Isaiah it is not said, 'Behold, the virgin shall conceive,' but, 'Behold, the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall conceive, and bear a son;' and [since] you explain the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> as if [it referred] to Hezekiah, who was your king, I shall endeavour to discuss shortly this point in opposition to you, and to show that reference is made to Him who is acknowledged by us as Christ.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 44. The Jews in vain promise themselves salvation, which cannot be obtained except through Christ</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For thus, so far as you are concerned, I shall be found in all respects innocent, if I strive earnestly to persuade you by bringing forward demonstrations. But if you remain hard-hearted, or weak in [forming] a resolution, on account of death, which is the lot of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and are unwilling to assent to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you shall appear as the authors of your own [<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>]. And you deceive yourselves while you fancy that, because you are the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> after the flesh, therefore you shall fully inherit the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things announced to be bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through Christ. For no one, not even of them,  has anything to look for, but only those who in mind are assimilated to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and who have  recognised all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>: for I say,  that some injunctions were laid on you in reference to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and practice of righteousness; but some injunctions and acts were likewise mentioned in reference to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, on account of  the hardness of your people's hearts. And that this is so, God makes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in Ezekiel, [when] He said concerning it: 'If <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and Jacob  and Daniel should beg either sons or daughters, the request would not be granted them.' <span class="stiki" id="note012081"><a href="../bible/eze014.htm#verse20">Ezekiel&nbsp;14:20</a></span> And in Isaiah, of the very same matter He spoke thus: 'The Lord God said, they shall both go forth and look on the members [of the bodies] of the men that have transgressed. For their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be a gazing-stock to all flesh.' <span class="stiki" id="note012082"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse24">Isaiah&nbsp;66:24</a></span> So that it becomes you to eradicate this hope from your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and hasten to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what way forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and a hope of inheriting the promised <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, shall be yours. But there is no other [way] than this&mdash;to become acquainted with this Christ, to be washed in the fountain  spoken of by Isaiah for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and for the rest, to live sinless lives.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 45. Those who were righteous before and under the law shall be saved by Christ</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> If I seem to interrupt these matters, which you say must be investigated, yet the question which I mean to put is urgent. Allow me first.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Ask whatever you please, as it occurs to you; and I shall endeavour, after questions and answers, to resume and complete the discourse.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Tell me, then, shall those who lived according to the law given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, live in the same manner with Jacob, <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, in the resurrection of the dead, or not?</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> When I quoted, sir, the words spoken by Ezekiel, that 'even if <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and Daniel and Jacob were to beg sons and daughters, the request would not be granted them,' but that each one, that is to say, shall be saved by his own righteousness, I said also, that those who regulated their lives by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> would in like manner be saved. For what in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> is naturally good, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and righteous, and has been prescribed to be done by those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> it;  and what was appointed to be performed by reason of the hardness of the people's hearts; was similarly recorded, and done also by those who were under the law. Since those who did that which is universally, naturally, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> good are pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they shall be saved through this Christ in the resurrection equally with those righteous men who were before them, namely <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, and Jacob, and whoever else there be, along with those who have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>  this Christ, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who was before the morning star and the moon, and submitted to become incarnate, and be born of this virgin of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David, in order that, by this dispensation, the serpent that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> from the beginning, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> like him, may be destroyed, and that death may be contemned, and for ever quit, at the second coming of the Christ Himself, those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him and live acceptably,&mdash;and be no more: when some are sent to be punished unceasingly into judgment and condemnation of fire; but others shall exist in freedom from suffering, from corruption, and from grief, and in <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 46. Trypho asks whether a man who keeps the law even now will be saved. Justin proves that it contributes nothing to righteousness</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> But if some, even now, wish to live in the observance of the institutions given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in this Jesus who was crucified, recognising Him to be the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that it is given to Him to be absolute Judge of all, and that His is the everlasting kingdom, can they also be saved?</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Let us consider that also together, whether one may now observe all the Mosaic institutions.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> No. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, as you said, it is not possible either anywhere to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the lamb of the passover, or to offer the goats ordered for the fast; or, in short, [to present] all the other offerings.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Tell [me] then yourself, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, some things which can be observed; for you will be persuaded that, though a man does not keep or has not performed the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>  decrees, he may assuredly be saved.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> To keep the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, to observe months, and to be washed if you touch anything prohibited by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, or after sexual intercourse.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Do you think that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, Jacob, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and Job, and all the rest before  or after them equally righteous, also Sarah the wife of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Rebekah the wife of Isaac, Rachel the wife of Jacob, and Leah, and all the rest of them, until the mother of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the faithful servant, who observed none of these [statutes], will be saved?</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Were not <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and his descendants <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>?</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and his descendants were <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>. The reason why <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was given to them I stated at length in what has gone before; and if what has been said does not convince you,  let us again search into the matter. But you are aware that, up to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, no one in fact who was righteous observed any of these <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> at all of which we are talking, or received one commandment to observe, except that of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which began from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, and admit that they are saved.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> You perceive that God by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> laid all such ordinances upon you on account of the hardness of your people's hearts, in order that, by the large number of them, you might keep God continually, and in every action, before your eyes, and never begin to act <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> or impiously. For He enjoined you to place around you [a fringe] of purple dye, <span class="stiki" id="note012088"><a href="../bible/num015.htm#verse38">Numbers&nbsp;15:38</a></span> in order that you might not forget <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and He commanded you to wear a phylactery, <span class="stiki" id="note012089"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:6</a></span> certain characters, which indeed we consider <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, being engraved on very thin parchment; and by these means stirring you up  to retain a constant remembrance of God: at the same time, however, convincing you, that in your hearts you have not even a faint remembrance of God's worship. Yet not even so were you dissuaded from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>: for in the times of Elijah, when [God] recounted the number of those who had not bowed the knee to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, He said the number was seven thousand; and in Isaiah He rebukes you for having <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> your children to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. But we, because we refuse to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to those to whom we were of old accustomed to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, undergo extreme penalties, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in death&mdash;believing that God will raise us up by His Christ, and will make us incorruptible, and undisturbed, and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the ordinances imposed by reason of the hardness of your people's hearts, contribute nothing to the performance of righteousness and of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 47. Justin communicates with Christians who observe the law. Not a few Catholics do otherwise</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> But if some one, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that this is so, after he recognises that this man is Christ, and has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in and obeys Him, wishes, however, to observe these [institutions], will he be saved?</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> In my opinion, Trypho, such an one will be saved, if he does not strive in every way to persuade other men&mdash;I mean those <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who have been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by Christ, to observe the same things as himself, telling them that they will not be saved unless they do so. This you did yourself at the commencement of the discourse, when you declared that I would not be saved unless I observe these institutions.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Why then have you said, 'In my opinion, such an one will be saved,' unless there are some  who affirm that such will not be saved?</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> There are such people, Trypho, and these do not venture to have any intercourse with or to extend hospitality to such persons; but I do not agree with them. But if some, through weak-mindedness, wish to observe such institutions as were given by Moses, from which they expect some virtue, but which we believe were appointed by reason of the hardness of the people's hearts, along with their hope in this Christ, and [wish to perform] the eternal and natural acts of righteousness and piety, yet choose to live with the Christians and the faithful, as I said before, not inducing them either to be circumcised like themselves, or to keep the Sabbath, or to observe any other such ceremonies, then I hold that we ought to join ourselves to such, and associate with them in all things as kinsmen and brethren. But if, Trypho, some of your race, who say they believe in this Christ, compel those Gentiles who believe in this Christ to live in all respects according to the law given by Moses, or choose not to associate so intimately with them, I in like manner do not approve of them. But I believe that even those, who have been persuaded by them to observe the legal dispensation along with their confession of God in Christ, shall probably be saved. And I hold, further, that such as have confessed and known this man to be Christ, yet who have gone back from some cause to the legal dispensation, and have denied that this man is Christ, and have repented not before death, shall by no means be saved. Further, I hold that those of the seed of Abraham who live according to the law, and do not believe in this Christ before death, shall likewise not be saved, and especially those who have anathematized and do anathematize this very Christ in the synagogues, and everything by which they might obtain salvation and escape the vengeance of fire.  For the goodness and the loving-kindness  of God, and His boundless riches, hold righteous and sinless the man who, as Ezekiel  tells, repents of sins; and reckons sinful, unrighteous, and impious the man who fails away from piety and righteousness to unrighteousness and ungodliness. Wherefore also our Lord Jesus Christ said, 'In whatsoever things I shall take you, in these I shall judge you.'</p>
