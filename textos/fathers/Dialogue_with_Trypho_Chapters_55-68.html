<h1>Dialogue with Trypho (Chapters 55-68)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 55. Trypho asks that Christ be proved God, but without metaphor. Justin promises to do so</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> We shall remember this your exposition, if you strengthen [your solution of] this difficulty by other arguments: but now resume the discourse, and show us that the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> admits another God besides the Maker of all things, taking care not to speak of the sun and moon, which, it is written,  God has given to the nations to worship as gods; and oftentimes the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, employing  this manner of speech, say that 'your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of lords,' adding frequently, 'the great and strong and terrible [God].' For such expressions are used, not as if they really were gods, but because the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> is teaching us that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made all things, is Lord alone of those who are reputed gods and lords. And in order that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> may convince [us] of this, He said by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David, 'The gods of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, reputed gods, are <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and not gods;'  and He denounces a curse on those who worship them.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> I would not bring forward these <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, Trypho, by which I am aware those who worship these [<a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>] and such like are condemned, but such [<a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>] as no one could find any objection to. They will appear strange to you, although you read them every day; so that even from this fact we  understand that, because of your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, God has withheld from you the ability to discern the wisdom of His Scriptures; yet [there are] some exceptions, to whom, according to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His long-suffering, as Isaiah said, He has left a seed of  <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, lest your race be utterly destroyed, like <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>. Pay attention, therefore, to what I shall record out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, which  do not need to be expounded, but only listened to.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 56. God who appeared to Moses is distinguished from God the Father</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, then, the blessed and faithful servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, declares that He who appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> under the oak in Mamre is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sent with the two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in His company to judge <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> by Another who remains ever in the supercelestial places, invisible to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, holding personal intercourse with none, whom we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be Maker and Father of all things; for he speaks thus: 'God appeared to him under the oak in Mamre, as he sat at his tent-door at noontide. And lifting up his eyes, he saw, and behold, three men stood before him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the door of his tent; and he bowed himself toward the ground, and said . . .' <span class="stiki" id="note012125"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;18:1-2</a></span>  '<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> went up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord: and he looked toward <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>, and toward the adjacent country, and beheld, and, lo, a flame went up from the earth, like the smoke of a furnace.'</p></blockquote>

<p>And when I had made an end of quoting these words, I asked them if they had understood them. And they said they had understood them, but that the passages adduced brought forward no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that there is any other God or Lord, or that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> says so, besides the Maker of all things.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> I shall attempt to persuade you, since you have understood the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, [of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>] of what I say, that there is, and that there is said to be, another God and Lord subject to  the Maker of all things; who is also called an Angel, because He announces to men whatsoever the Maker of all things&mdash;above whom there is no other God&mdash;wishes to announce to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>I quoted once more the previous passage.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Do you think that God appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> under the oak in Mamre, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> asserts?</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Assuredly.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Was He one of those three whom <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> saw, and whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> describes as men?</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> No; but God appeared to him, before the vision of the three. Then those three whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> calls men, were <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; two of them sent to destroy <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and one to announce the joyful tidings to Sarah, that she would bear a son; for which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> he was sent, and having accomplished his errand, went away. </p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> How then does the one of the three, who was in the tent, and who said, 'I shall return to you hereafter, and Sarah shall have a son,' <span class="stiki" id="note012129"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;18:10</a></span> appear to have returned when Sarah had begotten a son, and to be there declared, by the prophetic word, God? But that you may clearly discern what I say, listen to the words expressly employed by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; they are these: 'And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> bond-<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whom she bore to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, sporting with Isaac her son, and said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Cast out this bond-<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and her son; for the son of this bond-<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall not share the inheritance of my son Isaac. And the matter seemed very grievous in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> sight, because of his son. But God said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Let it not be grievous in your sight because of the son, and because of the bond-<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. In all that Sarah has said unto you, hearken to her voice; for in Isaac shall your seed be called.' <span class="stiki" id="note012130"><a href="../bible/gen021.htm#verse9">Genesis&nbsp;21:9-12</a></span> Have you perceived, then, that He who said under the oak that He would return, since He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it would be necessary to advise <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to do what Sarah wished him, came back as it is written; and is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the words declare, when they so speak: 'God said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Let it not be grievous in your sight because of the son, and because of the bond-<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>?'</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Certainly; but you have not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from this that there is another God besides Him who appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and who also appeared to the other patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. You have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, however, that we were wrong in believing that the three who were in the tent with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> were all <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> If I could not have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to you from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that one of those three is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is called Angel,  because, as I already said, He brings messages to those to whom God the Maker of all things wishes [messages to be brought], then in regard to Him who appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> on earth in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> in like manner as the two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who came with Him, and who was God even before the creation of the world, it were reasonable for you to entertain the same belief as is entertained by the whole of your nation.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Assuredly, for up to this moment this has been our belief.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Reverting to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, I shall endeavour to persuade you, that He who is said to have appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and to Jacob, and to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and who is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is distinct from Him who made all things&mdash;numerically, I mean, not [distinct] in will. For I affirm that He has never at any time done  anything  which He who made the world&mdash;above whom there is no other God&mdash;has not wished Him both to do and to engage Himself with.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Prove now that this is the case, that we also may agree with you. For we do not understand you to affirm that He has done or said anything contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Maker of all things.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> The Scripture just quoted by me will make this plain to you. It is thus: 'The sun was risen on the earth, and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> entered into Segor (Zoar); and the Lord rained on <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heaven, and overthrew these cities and all the neighbourhood.' <span class="stiki" id="note012133"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;19:23</a></span></p>

<p><strong>The fourth of those who had remained with Trypho:</strong> It  must therefore necessarily be said that one of the two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who went to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and is named by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> Lord, is different from Him who also is God and appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> It is not on this ground solely that it must be admitted absolutely that some other one is called Lord by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> besides Him who is considered Maker of all things; not solely [for what is said] by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but also [for what is said] by David. For there is written by him: 'The Lord says to my Lord, Sit on My right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool,'  as I have already quoted. And again, in other words: 'Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever. A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of Your kingdom: You have loved righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity: therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above Your fellows.'  If, therefore, you assert that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> calls some other one God and Lord, besides the Father of all things and His Christ, answer me; for I undertake to prove to you from Scriptures themselves, that He whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> calls Lord is not one of the two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that went to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, but He who was with them, and is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Prove this; for, as you see, the day advances, and we are not prepared for such perilous replies; since never yet have we heard any man investigating, or searching into, or proving these matters; nor would we have tolerated your conversation, had you not referred everything to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>:  for you are very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in adducing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from them; and you are of opinion that there is no God above the Maker of all things.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> You are aware, then, that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, 'And the Lord said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> conceive? For I am old. Is anything impossible with God? At the time appointed shall I return to you according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.' <span class="stiki" id="note012139"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse13">Genesis&nbsp;18:13-14</a></span> And after a little interval: 'And the men rose up from thence, and looked towards <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>; and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> went with them, to bring them on the way. And the Lord said, I will not conceal from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, my servant, what I do.' <span class="stiki" id="note012140"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;18:16-17</a></span> And again, after a little, it thus says: 'The Lord said, The cry of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> is great,  and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are very grievous. I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to their cry which has come unto me; and if not, that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. And the men turned away thence, and went to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was standing before the Lord; and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> drew near, and said, Wilt You destroy the righteous with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>?' <span class="stiki" id="note012142"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse20">Genesis&nbsp;18:20-23</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>And so on,  for I do not think fit to write over again the same words, having written them all before, but shall of necessity give those by which I established the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to Trypho and his companions. Then I proceeded to what follows, in which these words are recorded:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> 'And the Lord went His way as soon as He had left communing with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; and [<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>] went to his place. And there came two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> at even. And <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> sat in the gate of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>;' <span class="stiki" id="note012144"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse33">Genesis&nbsp;18:33</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;19:1</a></span> and what follows until, 'But the men put forth their hands, and pulled <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> into the house to them, and shut to the door of the house;' <span class="stiki" id="note012145"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;19:10</a></span> and what follows till,</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> laid hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hands of his daughters, the Lord being merciful to him. And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that they said, Save, save your life. Look not behind you, nor stay in all the neighbourhood; escape to the mountain, lest you be taken along with [them]. And <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> said to them, I beseech [You], O Lord, since Your servant has found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in Your sight, and You have magnified Your righteousness, which You showest towards me in saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountain, lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> overtake me, and I die. Behold, this city is near to flee unto, and it is small: there I shall be safe, since it is small; and any <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall live. And He said to him, Behold, I have accepted you  also in this matter,  so as not to destroy the city for which you have spoken. Make haste to save yourself there; for I shall not do anything till you have come there. Therefore he called the name of the city Segor (Zoar). The sun was risen upon the earth; and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> entered into Segor (Zoar). And the Lord rained on <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heaven; and He overthrew these cities, and all the neighbourhood. <span class="stiki" id="note012147"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;19:16-25</a></span></em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> <em>(After another pause.)</em> And now have you not perceived, my friends, that one of the three, who is both God and Lord, and ministers to Him who is in the heavens, is Lord of the two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>? For when [the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>] proceeded to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, He remained behind, and communed with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in the words recorded by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; and when He departed after the conversation, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> went back to his place. And when he came [to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>], the two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> no longer conversed with <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, but Himself, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> makes evident; and He is the Lord who received commission from the Lord who [remains] in the heavens, i.e., the Maker of all things, to inflict upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> the [judgments] which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> describes in these terms: 'The Lord rained down upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heaven.'</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 57. The Jew objects, why is He said to have eaten, if He be God? Answer of Justin</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> <em>(When I was silent.)</em> That Scripture compels us to admit this, is manifest; but there is a matter about which we are deservedly at a loss&mdash;namely, about what was said to the effect that [the Lord] ate what was prepared and placed before him by <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; and you would admit this.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> It is written that they ate; and if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>  that it is said the three ate, and not the two alone&mdash;who were really <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and are nourished in the heavens, as is evident to us, even though they are not nourished by food similar to that which mortals use&mdash;(for, concerning the sustenance of manna which supported your fathers in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, Scripture speaks thus, that they ate <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels'</a> food): [if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that three ate], then I would say that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> which affirms they ate bears the same meaning as when we would say about fire that it has devoured all things; yet it is not certainly understood that they ate, masticating with teeth and jaws. So that not even here should we be at a loss about anything, if we are acquainted even slightly with figurative modes of expression, and able to rise above them.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> It is possible that [the question] about the mode of eating may be thus explained: [the mode, that is to say,] in which it is written, they took and ate what had been prepared by <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: so that you may now proceed to explain to us how this God who appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and is minister to God the Maker of all things, being born of the Virgin, became man, of like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> with all, as you said previously.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Permit me first, Trypho, to collect some other <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> on this head, so that you, by the large number of them, may be persuaded of [the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of] it, and thereafter I shall explain what you ask.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Do as seems good to you; for I shall be thoroughly pleased.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 58. The same is proved from the visions which appeared to Jacob</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> I purpose to quote to you Scriptures, not that I am anxious to make merely an artful display of words; for I possess no such faculty, but God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> alone has been granted to me to the understanding of His Scriptures, of which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> I exhort all to become partakers freely and bounteously, in order that they may not, through want of it,  incur condemnation in the judgment which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Maker of all things shall hold through my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> What you do is worthy of the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but you appear to me to feign <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> when you say that you do not possess a store of artful words.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Be it so, since you think so; yet I am persuaded that I speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.  But give me your attention, that I may now rather adduce the remaining <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Proceed.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> It is again written by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, my brethren, that He who is called God and appeared to the patriarchs is called both Angel and Lord, in order that from this you may understand Him to be minister to the Father of all things, as you have already admitted, and may remain firm, persuaded by additional arguments. The word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, [recorded] by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when referring to Jacob the grandson of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, speaks thus:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>And it came to pass, when the sheep conceived, that I saw them with my eyes in the dream: And, behold, the he-goats and the rams which leaped upon the sheep and she-goats were spotted  with white, and speckled and sprinkled with a dun colour. And the Angel of God said to me in the dream, Jacob, Jacob. And I said, What is it, Lord? And He said, Lift up your eyes, and see that the he-goats and rams leaping on the sheep and she-goats are spotted with white, speckled, and sprinkled with a dun colour. For I have seen what Laban does unto you. I am the God who appeared to you in Bethel,  where you anointed a pillar and vowed a vow unto Me. Now therefore arise, and get you out of this land, and depart to the land of your birth, and I shall be with you. <span class="stiki" id="note012152"><a href="../bible/gen031.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;31:10-13</a></span></em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>And again, in other words, speaking of the same Jacob, it thus says:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>And having risen up that night, he took the two wives, and the two women-servants, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford Jabbok; and he took them and went over the brook, and sent over all his belongings. But Jacob was left behind alone, and an Angel  wrestled with him until morning. And He saw that He is not prevailing against him, and He touched the broad part of his thigh; and the broad part of Jacob's thigh grew stiff while he wrestled with Him. And He said, Let Me go, for the day breaks. But he said, I will not let You go, except You bless me. And He said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob. And He said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be your name; for you have prevailed with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with men shall be powerful. And Jacob asked Him, and said, Tell me Your name. But he said, Why do you ask after My name? And He blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of that place Peniel,  for I saw God face to face, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rejoiced. <span class="stiki" id="note012155"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;32:22-30</a></span></em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>And again, in other terms, referring to the same Jacob, it says the following:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>And Jacob came to Luz, in the land of Canaan, which is Bethel, he and all the people that were with him. And there he built an altar, and called the name of that place Bethel; for there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>. And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and Jacob called the name of it The Oak of Sorrow. And God appeared again to Jacob in Luz, when he came out from Mesopotamia in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and He blessed him. And God said to him, Your name shall be no more called Jacob, but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall he your name. <span class="stiki" id="note012156"><a href="../bible/gen035.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;35:6-10</a></span></em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>He is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He is and shall be God.</p></blockquote>

<p>And when all had agreed on these grounds, I continued:</p>

<blockquote><p>Moreover, I consider it necessary to repeat to you the words which narrate how He who is both Angel and God and Lord, and who appeared as a man to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and who wrestled in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> with Jacob, was seen by him when he fled from his brother <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>. They are as follows: 'And Jacob went out from the well of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>,  and went toward Charran.  And he lighted on a spot, and slept there, for the sun was set; and he gathered of the stones of the place, and put them under his head. And he slept in that place; and he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, whose top reached to heaven; and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God ascended and descended upon it. And the Lord stood  above it, and He said, I am the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> your father, and of Isaac; be not afraid: the land whereon you lie to you will I give it, and to your seed; and your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and shall be extended to the west, and south, and north, and east: and in you, and in your seed, shall all <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am with you, keeping you in every way wherein you go, and will bring you again into this land; for I will not leave you, until I have done all that I have spoken to you of. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! This is none other than the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up in the morning, and took the stone which he had placed under his head, and he set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it; and Jacob called the name of the place The House of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the name of the city formerly was Ulammaus.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 59. God distinct from the Father conversed with Moses</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Permit me, further, to show you from the book of Exodus how this same One, who is both Angel, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Lord, and man, and who appeared in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Isaac,  appeared in a flame of fire from the bush, and conversed with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>And after they said they would listen cheerfully, patiently, and eagerly, I went on:</p>

<blockquote><p>These words are in the book which bears the title of Exodus: 'And after many days the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> died, and the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> groaned by reason of the works;' <span class="stiki" id="note012162"><a href="../bible/exo002.htm#verse23">Exodus&nbsp;2:23</a></span> and so on until, 'Go and gather the elders of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and you shall say unto them, The Lord God of your fathers, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, I am surely beholding you, and the things which have befallen you in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note012163"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse16">Exodus&nbsp;3:16</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to these words, I went on:</p>

<blockquote><p>Have you perceived, sirs, that this very God whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> speaks of as an Angel that talked to him in the flame of fire, declares to  <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that He is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, of Isaac, and of Jacob?</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 60. Opinions of the Jews with regard to Him who appeared in the bush</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> We do not perceive this from the passage quoted by you, but [only this], that it was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who appeared in the flame of fire, but God who conversed with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; so that there were really two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in company with each other, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that appeared in that vision.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Even if this were so, my friends, that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and God were together in the vision seen by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, yet, as has already been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to you by the passages previously quoted, it will not be the Creator of all things that is the God that said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that He was the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob, but it will be He who has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to you to have appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, ministering to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Maker of all things, and likewise carrying into execution His counsel in the judgment of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>; so that, even though it be as you say, that there were two&mdash;an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and God&mdash;he who has but the smallest intelligence will not venture to assert that the Maker and Father of all things, having left all supercelestial matters, was visible on a little portion of the earth.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Since it has been previously <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that He who is called God and Lord, and appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, received from the Lord, who is in the heavens, that which He inflicted on the land of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, even although an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had accompanied the God who appeared to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, we shall perceive that the God who communed with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> from the bush was not the Maker of all things, but He who has been shown to have manifested Himself to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and to Isaac and to Jacob; who also is called and is perceived to be the Angel of God the Maker of all things, because He publishes to men the commands of the Father and Maker of all things.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Now assuredly, Trypho, I shall show that, in the vision of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, this same One alone who is called an Angel, and who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, appeared to and communed with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says thus: 'The Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the bush; and he sees that the bush burns with fire, but the bush was not consumed. And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said, I will turn aside and see this great sight, for the bush is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he is turning aside to behold, the Lord called to him out of the bush.' <span class="stiki" id="note012164"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;3:2-4</a></span> In the same manner, therefore, in which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> calls Him who appeared to Jacob in the dream an Angel, then [says] that the same Angel who appeared in the dream spoke to him, <span class="stiki" id="note012165"><a href="../bible/gen035.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;35:7</a></span> saying, 'I am the God that appeared to you when you fled from the face of <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> your brother;' and [again] says that, in the judgment which befell <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> in the days of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the Lord had inflicted the punishment  of the Lord who [dwells] in the heavens;&mdash;even so here, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, in announcing that the Angel of the Lord appeared to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and in afterwards declaring him to be Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, speaks of the same One, whom it declares by the many testimonies already quoted to be minister to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is above the world, above whom there is no other [God].</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 61. Wisdom is begotten of the Father, as fire from fire</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> I shall give you another testimony, my friends, from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, that God begot before all creatures a Beginning,  [who was] a certain rational power [proceeding] from Himself, who is called by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, now the Glory of the Lord, now the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, again Wisdom, again an Angel, then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and then Lord and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>; and on another occasion He calls Himself Captain, when He appeared in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> to Joshua the son of Nave (Nun). For He can be called by all those names, since He ministers to the Father's will, and since He was begotten of the Father by an act of will;  just as we see  happening among ourselves: for when we give out some word, we beget the word; yet not by abscission, so as to lessen the word  [which remains] in us, when we give it out: and just as we see also happening in the case of a fire, which is not lessened when it has kindled [another], but remains the same; and that which has been kindled by it likewise appears to exist by itself, not diminishing that from which it was kindled. The Word of Wisdom, who is Himself this God begotten of the Father of all things, and Word, and Wisdom, and Power, and the Glory of the Begetter, will bear evidence to me, when He speaks by Solomon the following:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>If I shall declare to you what happens daily, I shall call to mind events from everlasting, and review them. The Lord made me the  beginning of His ways for His works. From everlasting He established me in the beginning, before He had made the earth, and before He had made the deeps, before the springs of the waters had issued forth, before the mountains had been established. Before all the hills He begets me. God made the country, and the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and the highest inhabited places under the sky. When He made ready the heavens, I was along with Him, and when He set up His throne on the winds: when He made the high clouds strong, and the springs of the deep safe, when He made the foundations of the earth, I was with Him arranging. I was that in which He rejoiced; daily and at all times I delighted in His countenance, because He delighted in the finishing of the habitable world, and delighted in the sons of men. Now, therefore, O son, hear me. Blessed is the man who shall listen to me, and the mortal who shall keep my ways, watching  daily at my doors, observing the posts of my ingoings. For my outgoings are the outgoings of life, and [my] will has been prepared by the Lord. But they who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against me, trespass against their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; and they who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> me <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> death. </em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 62. The words <q>Let Us make man</q> agree with the testimony of Proverbs</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And the same sentiment was expressed, my friends, by the word of God [written] by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when it indicated to us, with regard to Him whom it has pointed out,  that God speaks in the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with the very same design, in the following words: 'Let Us make man after our image and likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creeping things that creep on the earth. And God created man: after the image of God did He create him; male and female created He them. And God blessed them, and said, Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and have power over it.'  And that you may not change the [force of the] words just quoted, and repeat what your teachers assert&mdash;either that God said to Himself, 'Let Us make,' just as we, when about to do something, oftentimes say to ourselves, 'Let us make;' or that God spoke to the elements, to wit, the earth and other similar substances of which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> man was formed, 'Let Us make,'&mdash;I shall quote again the words narrated by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself, from which we can indisputably learn that [God] conversed with some one who was numerically distinct from Himself, and also a rational Being. These are the words: 'And God said, Behold, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> has become as one of us, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note012175"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;3:22</a></span> In saying, therefore, 'as one of us,' [<a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>] has declared that [there is a certain] number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> associated with one another, and that they are at least two. For I would not say that the dogma of that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>  which is said to be among you  is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, or that the teachers of it can prove that [God] spoke to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frame was the workmanship of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But this Offspring, which was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> brought forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, was with the Father before all the creatures, and the Father communed with Him; even as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> by Solomon has made clear, that He whom Solomon calls Wisdom, was begotten as a Beginning before all His creatures and as Offspring by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has also declared this same thing in the revelation made by Joshua the son of Nave (Nun). Listen, therefore, to the following from the book of Joshua, that what I say may become manifest to you; it is this: 'And it came to pass, when Joshua was near <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, he lifted up his eyes, and sees a man standing over against him. And Joshua approached to Him, and said, Are you for us, or for our adversaries? And He said to him, I am Captain of the Lord's host: now have I come. And Joshua fell on his face on the ground, and said to Him, Lord, what do You command Your servant? And the Lord's Captain says to Joshua, Loose the shoes off your feet; for the place whereon you stand is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ground. And <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> was shut up and fortified, and no one went out of it. And the Lord said to Joshua, Behold, I give into your hand <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, and its king, [and] its mighty men.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 63. It is proved that this God was incarnate</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> This point has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to me forcibly, and by many arguments, my friend. It remains, then, to prove that He submitted to become man by the Virgin, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of His Father; and to be crucified, and to die. Prove also clearly, that after this He rose again and ascended to heaven.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> This, too, has been already demonstrated  by me in the previously quoted words of the prophecies, my friends; which, by recalling and expounding for your sakes, I shall endeavour to lead you to agree with me also about this matter. The passage, then, which Isaiah records, 'Who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken away from the earth,' <span class="stiki" id="note012179"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;53:8</a></span>&mdash;does it not appear to you to refer to One who, not having descent from men, was said to be delivered over to death by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the transgressions of the people?&mdash;of whose blood, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (as I mentioned before), when speaking in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, said, that He would wash His garments in the blood of the grape; since His blood did not spring from the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And then, what is said by David, 'In the splendours of Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> have I begotten You from the womb, before the morning star.  The Lord has <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, and will not repent, You are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever, after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>,' &mdash;does this not declare to you  that [He was] from of old,  and that the God and Father of all things intended Him to be begotten by a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> womb? And speaking in other words, which also have been already quoted, [he says]: 'Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of rectitude is the sceptre of Your kingdom. You have loved righteousness, and have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity: therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above Your fellows. [He has anointed You] with myrrh, and oil, and cassia from Your garments, from the ivory palaces, whereby they made You glad. King's daughters are in Your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The queen stood at Your right hand, clad in garments embroidered with gold.  Hearken, O daughter, and behold, and incline your ear, and forget your people and the house of your father; and the King shall desire your beauty: because he is your Lord, and you shall worship Him.'  Therefore these words testify explicitly that He is witnessed to by Him who established these things,  as deserving to be worshipped, as God and as Christ. Moreover, that the word of God speaks to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him as being one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and one church, as to a daughter; that it thus addresses the church which has sprung from His name and partakes of His name (for we are all called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>), is distinctly proclaimed in like manner in the following words, which teach us also to forget [our] old ancestral customs, when they speak thus:  'Hearken, O daughter, and behold, and incline your ear; forget your people and the house of your father, and the King shall desire your beauty: because He is your Lord, and you shall worship Him.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 64. Justin adduces other proofs to the Jew, who denies that he needs this Christ</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Let Him be recognised as Lord and Christ and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> declare, by you of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who have from His name been all called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; but we who are servants of God that made this same [Christ], do not require to confess or worship Him.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> If I were to be quarrelsome and light-minded like you, Trypho, I would no longer continue to converse with you, since you are prepared not to understand what has been said, but only to return some captious answer;  but now, since I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I do not state an untimely opinion concerning any one of your nation, as to whether or not some of them may be saved by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord of Sabaoth. Therefore, although you act wrongfully, I shall continue to reply to any proposition you shall bring forward, and to any contradiction which you make; and, in fact, I do the very same to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of every nation, who wish to examine along with me, or make inquiry at me, regarding this subject. Accordingly, if you had bestowed attention on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> previously quoted by me, you would already have understood, that those who are saved of your own nation are saved through this  [man], and partake of His lot; and you would not certainly have asked me about this matter. I shall again repeat the words of David previously quoted by me, and beg of you to comprehend them, and not to act wrongfully, and stir each other up to give merely some contradiction. The words which David speaks, then, are these: 'The Lord has reigned; let the nations be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: [it is] He who sits upon the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>; let the earth be shaken. The Lord is great in Zion; and He is high above all the nations. Let them confess Your great name, for it is fearful and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the king loves judgment. You have prepared equity; judgment and righteousness have You performed in Jacob. Exalt the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and worship the footstool of His feet; for He is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> among His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and Samuel among them that call upon His name; they called on the Lord, and He heard them. In the pillar of the cloud He spoke to them; for they kept His testimonies and His commandments which He gave them.'  And  from the other words of David, also previously quoted, which you foolishly affirm refer to Solomon, [because] inscribed for Solomon, it can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that they do not refer to Solomon, and that this [Christ] <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the sun, and that those of your nation who are saved shall be saved through Him. [The words] are these: 'O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, give Your judgment to the king, and Your righteousness unto the king's son. He shall judge  Your people with righteousness, and Your poor with judgment. The mountains shall take up peace to the people, and the little hills righteousness. He shall judge the poor of the people, and shall save the children of the needy, and shall abase the slanderer: and He shall co-endure with the sun, and before the moon unto all generations;' and so on until, 'His name endures before the sun, and all tribes of the earth shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in Him. All nations shall call Him blessed. Blessed be the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who only does wondrous things: and blessed be His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> name for ever and ever: and the whole earth shall be filled with His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.'  And you remember from other words also spoken by David, and which I have mentioned before, how it is declared that He would come forth from the highest heavens, and again return to the same places, in order that you may recognise Him as God coming forth from above, and man living among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and [how it is declared] that He will again appear, and they who pierced Him shall see Him, and shall bewail Him. [The words] are these: 'The heavens declare the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the firmament shows His handiwork. Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night shows <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: They are not speeches or words whose voices are heard. Their sound has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. In the sun has he set his habitation; and he, like a bridegroom going forth from his chamber, will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> as a giant to run his race: from the highest heaven is his going forth, and he returns to the highest heaven, and there is not one who shall be hidden from his heat.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 65. The Jew objects that God does not give His glory to another. Justin explains the passage</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Being shaken  by so many Scriptures, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what to say about the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> which Isaiah writes, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> says that He gives not His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to another, speaking thus 'I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>; this is my name; my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will I not give to another, nor my <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note012195"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;42:8</a></span> </p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> If you spoke these words, Trypho, and then kept silence in simplicity and with no ill intent, neither repeating what goes before nor adding what comes after, you must be forgiven; but if [you have done so] because you imagined that you could throw <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on the passage, in order that I might say the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> contradicted each other, you have erred. But I shall not venture to suppose or to say such a thing; and if a Scripture which appears to be of such a kind be brought forward, and if there be a pretext [for saying] that it is contrary [to some other], since I am entirely convinced that no Scripture contradicts another, I shall admit rather that I do not understand what is recorded, and shall strive to persuade those who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are contradictory, to be rather of the same opinion as myself. With what intent, then, you have brought forward the difficulty, God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. But I shall remind you of what the passage says, in order that you may recognise even from this very [place] that God gives <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to His Christ alone. And I shall take up some short passages, sirs, those which are in connection with what has been said by Trypho, and those which are also joined on in consecutive order. For I will not repeat those of another section, but those which are joined together in one. Do you also give me your attention. [The words] are these:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>Thus says the Lord, the God that created the heavens, and made  them fast, that established the earth, and that which is in it; and gave breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them who walk therein: I the Lord God have called You in righteousness, and will hold Your hand, and will strengthen You; and I have given You for a covenant of the people, for a light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out them that are bound from the chains, and those who sit in darkness from the prison-house. I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>; this is my name: my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will I not give to another, nor my <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to graven images. Behold, the former things have come to pass; new things which I announce, and before they are announced they are made manifest to you. Sing unto the Lord a new song: His sovereignty [is] from the end of the earth. [Sing], you who descend into the sea, and continually sail  [on it]; you islands, and inhabitants thereof. Rejoice, O wilderness, and the villages thereof, and the houses; and the inhabitants of Cedar shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and the inhabitants of the rock shall cry aloud from the top of the mountains: they shall give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; they shall publish His <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> among the islands. The Lord God of hosts shall go forth, He shall destroy <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> utterly, He shall stir up  <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and He shall cry aloud to the enemies with strength. <span class="stiki" id="note012198"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;42:5-13</a></span></em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>And when I repeated this, I continued:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Have you perceived, my friends, that God says He will give Him whom He has established as a light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and to no other; and not, as Trypho said, that God was retaining the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to Himself?</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> We have perceived this also; pass on therefore to the remainder of the discourse.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 66. He proves from Isaiah that God was born from a virgin</h2>

<p>And I, resuming the discourse where I had left off  at a previous stage, when proving that He was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and that His birth of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> had been predicted by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, quoted again the same <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. It is as follows: <q>And the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying, Ask for yourself a sign from the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the depth or in the height. And Ahaz said I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. And Isaiah said, Hear then, O house of David; Is it no small thing for you to contend with men? And how do you contend with the Lord? Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign; Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat; before he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> or prefers the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he will choose out the good. For before the child <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> ill or good, he rejects <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by choosing out the good. For before the child <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to call father or mother, he shall receive the power of Damascus, and the spoil of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, in presence of the king of Assyria. And the land shall be forsaken, which  you shall with difficulty endure in consequence of the presence of its two kings. But God shall bring on you, and on your people, and on the house of your father, days which have not yet come upon you since the day in which Ephraim took away from Judah the king of Assyria.</q> </p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Now it is evident to all, that in the race of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> according to the flesh no one has been born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, or is said to have been born [of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>], save this our Christ.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 67. Trypho compares Jesus with Perseus; and would prefer [to say] that He was elected [to be Christ] on account of observance of the law. Justin speaks of the law as formerly</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> The Scripture has not, 'Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,' but, 'Behold, the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall conceive, and bear a son,' and so on, as you quoted. But the whole <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> refers to Hezekiah, and it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that it was fulfilled in him, according to the terms of this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Moreover, in the fables of those who are called Greeks, it is written that Perseus was begotten of Danae, who was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; he who was called among them Zeus having descended on her in the form of a golden shower. And you ought to feel ashamed when you make assertions similar to theirs, and rather [should] say that this Jesus was born man of men. And if you prove from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that He is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and that on account of having led a life conformed to the law, and perfect, He deserved the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being elected to be Christ, [it is well]; but do not venture to tell monstrous phenomena, lest you be convicted of talking foolishly like the Greeks.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Trypho, I wish to persuade you, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in short, of this, that even though you talk worse things in ridicule and in jest, you will not move me from my fixed design; but I shall always adduce from the words which you think can be brought forward [by you] as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> [of your own views], the demonstration of what I have stated along with the testimony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. You are not, however, acting fairly or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfully</a> in attempting to undo those things in which there has been constantly agreement between us; namely, that certain commands were instituted by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> on account of the hardness of your people's hearts. For you said that, by reason of His living conformably to law, He was elected and became Christ, if indeed He were <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be so.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> You admitted  to us that He was both <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and observed the other legal ceremonies ordained by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> I have admitted it, and do admit it: yet I have admitted that He endured all these not as if He were justified by them, but completing the dispensation which His Father, the Maker of all things, and Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wished Him [to complete]. For I admit that He endured crucifixion and death, and the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, and the suffering of as many afflictions as your nation put upon Him. But since again you dissent from that to which you but lately assented, Trypho, answer me: Are those righteous patriarchs who lived before <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who observed none of those [ordinances] which, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> shows, received the commencement of [their] institution from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saved, [and have they attained to] the inheritance of the blessed?</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong>  The Scriptures compel me to admit it.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Likewise I again ask you, did God enjoin your fathers to present the offerings and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> because He had need of them, or because of the hardness of their hearts and tendency to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>?</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> The latter the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> in like manner compel us to admit.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Likewise, did not the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> predict that God promised to dispense a new covenant besides that which [was dispensed] in the mountain Horeb?</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> This, too, had been predicted.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Was not the old covenant laid on your fathers with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling, so that they could not give ear to God?</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> He admitted it.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> What then? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> promised that there would be another covenant, not like that old one, and said that it would be laid on them without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and trembling, and lightnings, and that it would be such as to show what kind of commands and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and suited to every nation, and what commandments He has given, suiting them to the hardness of your people's hearts, as He exclaims also by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> To this also, those who are lovers of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and not lovers of strife must assuredly assent.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how you speak of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> very fond of strife, [since] you yourself oftentimes were plainly acting in this very manner, frequently contradicting what you had agreed to.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 68. He complains of the obstinacy of Trypho; he answers his objection; he convicts the Jews of bad faith</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> You endeavour to prove an incredible and nearly impossible thing; [namely], that God endured to be born and become man.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> If I undertook to prove this by doctrines or arguments of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, you should not bear with me. But if I quote frequently Scriptures, and so many of them, referring to this point, and ask you to comprehend them, you are hard-hearted in the recognition of the mind and <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if you wish to remain for ever so, I would not be injured at all; and for ever retaining the same [opinions] which I had before I met with you, I shall leave you.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Look, my friend, you made yourself master of these [truths] with much labour and toil.  And we accordingly must diligently scrutinize all that we meet with, in order to give our assent to those things which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> compel us [to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>].</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> I do not ask you not to strive earnestly by all means, in making an investigation of the matters inquired into; but [I ask you], when you have nothing to say, not to contradict those things which you said you had admitted.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> So we shall endeavour to do.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> In addition to the questions I have just now put to you, I wish to put more: for by means of these questions I shall strive to bring the discourse to a speedy termination.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Ask the questions.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Do you think that any other one is said to be worthy of worship and called Lord and God in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, except the Maker of all, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who by so many Scriptures was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to you to have become man?</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> How can we admit this, when we have instituted so great an inquiry as to whether there is any other than the Father alone?</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> I must ask you this also, that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether or not you are of a different opinion from that which you admitted some time ago. </p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> It is not, sir.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Since you certainly admit these things, and since <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, 'Who shall declare His generation?' ought you not now to suppose that He is not the seed of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>?</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> How then does the Word say to David, that out of his loins God shall take to Himself a Son, and shall establish His kingdom, and shall set Him on the throne of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Trypho, if the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which Isaiah uttered, 'Behold, the virgin shall conceive,' is said not to the house of David, but to another house of the twelve tribes, perhaps the matter would have some difficulty; but since this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> refers to the house of David, Isaiah has explained how that which was spoken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to David in <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> would take place. But perhaps you are not aware of this, my friends, that there were many sayings written obscurely, or <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parabolically</a>, or mysteriously, and <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> actions, which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who lived after the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who said or did them expounded.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Assuredly.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> If therefore, I shall show that this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Isaiah refers to our Christ, and not to Hezekiah, as you say, shall I not in this matter, too, compel you not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> your teachers, who venture to assert that the explanation which your  seventy elders that were with Ptolemy the king of the Egyptians gave, is untrue in certain respects? For some statements in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, which appear explicitly to convict them of a foolish and vain opinion, these they venture to assert have not been so written. But other statements, which they fancy they can distort and harmonize with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions,  these, they say, refer not to this <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> of ours, but to him of whom they are pleased to explain them. Thus, for instance, they have taught you that this Scripture which we are now discussing refers to Hezekiah, in which, as I promised, I shall show they are wrong. And since they are compelled, they agree that some Scriptures which we mention to them, and which expressly prove that Christ was to suffer, to be worshipped, and [to be called] <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which I have already recited to you, do refer indeed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but they venture to assert that this man is not Christ. But they admit that He will come to suffer, and to reign, and to be worshipped, and to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  and this opinion I shall in like manner show to be ridiculous and silly. But since I am pressed to answer first to what was said by you in jest, I shall make answer to it, and shall afterwards give replies to what follows.</p></blockquote>
