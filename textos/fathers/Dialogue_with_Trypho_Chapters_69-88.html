<h1>Dialogue with Trypho (Chapters 69-88)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 69. The devil, since he emulates the truth, has invented fables about Bacchus, Hercules, and &AElig;sculapius</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Be well assured, then, Trypho, that I am established in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> by those counterfeits which he who is called the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is said to have performed among the Greeks; just as some were wrought by the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and others by the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> in Elijah's days. For when they tell that Bacchus, son of Jupiter, was begotten by [Jupiter's] intercourse with Semele, and that he was the discoverer of the vine; and when they relate, that being torn in pieces, and having died, he rose again, and ascended to heaven; and when they introduce wine  into his <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, do I not perceive that [the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>] has imitated the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> announced by the patriarch Jacob, and recorded by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? And when they tell that Hercules was strong, and travelled over all the world, and was begotten by Jove of Alcmene, and ascended to heaven when he died, do I not perceive that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> which speaks of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, 'strong as a giant to run his race,'  has been in like manner imitated? And when he [the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>] brings forward &AElig;sculapius as the raiser of the dead and healer of all diseases, may I not say that in this matter likewise he has imitated the prophecies about Christ? But since I have not quoted to you such Scripture as tells that Christ will do these things, I must necessarily remind you of one such: from which you can understand, how that to those destitute of a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I mean the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who, 'having eyes, saw not, and having a heart, understood not,' worshipping the images of wood, [how even to them] Scripture prophesied that they would renounce these [vanities], and hope in this Christ. It is thus written:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>Rejoice, thirsty wilderness: let the wilderness be glad, and blossom as the lily: the deserts of the Jordan shall both blossom and be glad: and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Lebanon was given to it, and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Carmel. And my people shall see the exaltation of the Lord, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Be strong, you careless hands and enfeebled knees. Be comforted, you faint in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: be strong, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not. Behold, our God gives, and will give, retributive judgment. He shall come and save us. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear. Then the lame shall leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be distinct: for water has broken forth in the wilderness, and a valley in the thirsty land; and the parched ground shall become pools, and a spring of water shall [rise up] in the thirsty land. <span class="stiki" id="note012209"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;35:1-7</a></span></em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The spring of living water which gushed forth from God in the land destitute of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely the land of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, was this Christ, who also appeared in your nation, and healed those who were maimed, and deaf, and lame in body from their birth, causing them to leap, to hear, and to see, by His word. And having raised the dead, and causing them to live, by His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> He compelled the men who lived at that time to recognise Him. But though they saw such works, they asserted it was magical art. For they dared to call Him a magician, and a deceiver of the people. Yet He wrought such works, and persuaded those who were [destined to] <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him; for even if any one be labouring under a defect of body, yet be an observer of the doctrines delivered by Him, He shall raise him up at His second advent perfectly sound, after He has made him <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and incorruptible, and free from grief.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 70. So also the mysteries of Mithras are distorted from the prophecies of Daniel and Isaiah</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And when those who record the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a> say that he was begotten of a rock, and call the place where those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him are initiated a cave, do I not perceive here that the utterance of Daniel, that a stone without  hands was cut out of a great mountain, has been imitated by them, and that they have attempted likewise to imitate the whole of Isaiah's  words?  For they  contrived that the words of righteousness be quoted also by them.  But I must repeat to you the words of Isaiah referred to, in order that from them you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these things are so. They are these: 'Hear, you that are far off, what I have done; those that are near shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my might. The sinners in Zion are removed; trembling shall seize the impious. Who shall announce to you the everlasting place? The man who walks in righteousness, speaks in the right way, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and unrighteousness, and keeps his hands pure from <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>, stops the ears from hearing the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgment of blood closes the eyes from seeing unrighteousness: he shall dwell in the lofty cave of the strong rock. Bread shall be given to him, and his water [shall be] sure. You shall see the King with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and your eyes shall look far off. Your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall pursue diligently the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord. Where is the scribe? Where are the counsellors? Where is he that numbers those who are nourished&mdash;the small and great people? With whom they did not take counsel, nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the depth of the voices, so that they heard not. The people who have become depreciated, and there is no understanding in him who hears.' <span class="stiki" id="note012214"><a href="../bible/isa033.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;33:13-19</a></span> Now it is evident, that in this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> [allusion is made] to the bread which our Christ gave us to eat,  in remembrance of His being made flesh for the sake of His <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, for whom also He suffered; and to the cup which He gave us to drink,  in remembrance of His own blood, with giving of thanks. And this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> proves that we shall behold this very King with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and the very terms of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> declare loudly, that the people foreknown to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him were foreknown to pursue diligently the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord. Moreover, these Scriptures are equally explicit in saying, that those who are reputed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the writings of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and who hear the prophecies, have no understanding. And when I hear, Trypho, that Perseus was begotten of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, I understand that the deceiving serpent counterfeited also this.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 71. The Jews reject the interpretation of the Septuagint, from which, moreover, they have taken away some passages</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> But I am far from putting reliance in your teachers, who refuse to admit that the interpretation made by the seventy elders who were with Ptolemy [king] of the Egyptians is a correct one; and they attempt to frame another. And I wish you to observe, that they have altogether taken away many Scriptures from the translations effected by those seventy elders who were with Ptolemy, and by which this very man who was crucified is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have been set forth expressly as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and man, and as being crucified, and as dying; but since I am aware that this is denied by all of your nation, I do not address myself to these points, but I proceed  to carry on my discussions by means of those passages which are still admitted by you. For you assent to those which I have brought before your attention, except that you contradict the statement, 'Behold, the virgin shall conceive,' and say it ought to be read, 'Behold, the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall conceive.' And I promised to prove that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> referred, not, as you were taught, to Hezekiah, but to this Christ of mine: and now I shall go to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> We ask you first of all to tell us some of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which you allege have been completely cancelled.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 72. Passages have been removed by the Jews from Esdras and Jeremiah</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> I shall do as you please. From the statements, then, which Esdras made in reference to the law of the passover, they have taken away the following: 'And Esdras said to the people, This passover is our Saviour and our refuge. And if you have understood, and your heart has taken it in, that we shall <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> Him on a standard, and  thereafter hope in Him, then this place shall not be forsaken for ever, says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of hosts. But if you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him, and will not listen to His declaration, you shall be a laughing-stock to the nations.'  And from the sayings of Jeremiah they have cut out the following: 'I [was] like a lamb that is brought to the slaughter: they devised a device against me, saying, Come, let us lay on wood on His bread, and let us blot Him out from the land of the living; and His name shall no more be remembered.' <span class="stiki" id="note012220"><a href="../bible/jer011.htm#verse19">Jeremiah&nbsp;11:19</a></span> And since this passage from the sayings of Jeremiah is still written in some copies  [of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>] in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (for it is only a short time since they were cut out), and since from these words it is demonstrated that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> deliberated about the Christ Himself, to crucify and put Him to death, He Himself is both declared to be led as a sheep to the slaughter, as was predicted by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, and is here represented as a harmless lamb; but being in a difficulty about them, they give themselves over to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. And again, from the sayings of the same Jeremiah these have been cut out: 'The Lord God remembered His dead people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> who lay in the graves; and He descended to preach to them His own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 73. [The words] <q>From the wood</q> have been cut out of Psalm 96</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And from the ninety-fifth (ninety-sixth) Psalm they have taken away this short saying of the words of David: 'From the wood.'  For when the passage said, 'Tell among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, the Lord has reigned from the wood,' they have left, 'Tell among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, the Lord has reigned.' Now no one of your people has ever been said to have reigned as God and Lord among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, with the exception of Him only who was crucified, of whom also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> affirms in the same Psalm that He was raised again, and freed from [the grave], declaring that there is none like Him among the gods of the nations: for they are <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But I shall repeat the whole Psalm to you, that you may perceive what has been said. It is thus: 'Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth. Sing unto the Lord, and bless His name; show forth His <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from day to day. Declare His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, His wonders among all people. For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: He is to be feared above all the gods. For all the gods of the nations are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> but the Lord made the heavens. Confession and beauty are in His presence; <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and magnificence are in His sanctuary. Bring to the Lord, O you countries of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, bring to the Lord <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, bring to the Lord <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in His name. Take <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and go into His courts; worship the Lord in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple. Let the whole earth be moved before Him: tell among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, the Lord has reigned.  For He has established the world, which shall not be moved; He shall judge the nations with equity. Let the heavens <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and the earth be glad; let the sea and its fullness shake. Let the fields and all therein be joyful. Let all the trees of the wood be glad before the Lord: for He comes, for He comes to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.'</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Whether [or not] the rulers of the people have erased any portion of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, as you affirm, God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; but it seems incredible.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Assuredly, it does seem incredible. For it is more horrible than the calf which they made, when satisfied with manna on the earth; or than the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of children to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; or than the slaying of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. But you appear to me not to have heard the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which I said they had stolen away. For such as have been quoted are more than enough to prove the points in dispute, besides those which are retained by us,  and shall yet be brought forward.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 74. The beginning of Psalm 96 is attributed to the Father [by Trypho]. But [it refers] to Christ by these words: <q>Tell among the nations that the Lord,</q> etc</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you quoted these because we asked you. But it does not appear to me that this Psalm which you quoted last from the words of David refers to any other than the Father and Maker of the heavens and earth. You, however, asserted that it referred to Him who suffered, whom you also are eagerly endeavouring to prove to be Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Attend to me, I beseech you, while I speak of the statement which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> gave utterance to in this Psalm; and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I speak not sinfully, and that we  are not really bewitched; for so you shall be enabled of yourselves to understand many other statements made by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. 'Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth: sing unto the Lord, and bless His name; show forth His <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from day to day, His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> among all people.' He bids the inhabitants of all the earth, who have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, i.e., the suffering of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by which He saved them, sing and give praises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father of all things, and recognise that He is to be praised and feared, and that He is the Maker of heaven and earth, who effected this <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, who also was crucified and was dead, and who was deemed worthy by Him (God) to reign over all the earth. As [is clearly seen ] also by the land into which [He said] He would  bring [your fathers]; [for He thus speaks]: <span class="stiki" id="note012227"><a href="../bible/deu031.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy&nbsp;31:16-18</a></span> 'This people [shall go a whoring after other gods], and shall forsake Me, and shall break my covenant which I made with them in that day; and I will forsake them, and will turn away My face from them; and they shall be devoured,  and many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and afflictions shall find them out; and they shall say in that day, Because the Lord my God is not among us, these misfortunes have found us out. And I shall certainly turn away My face from them in that day, on account of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which they have committed, in that they have turned to other gods.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 75. It is proved that Jesus was the name of God in the book of Exodus</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Moreover, in the book of Exodus we have also perceived that the name of God Himself which, He says, was not revealed to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> or to Jacob, was Jesus, and was declared mysteriously through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Thus it is written: 'And the Lord spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, Say to this people, Behold, I send My <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> before your face, to keep you in the way, to bring you into the land which I have prepared for you. Give heed to Him, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him; do not disobey Him. For He will not draw back from you; for My name is in Him.' <span class="stiki" id="note012230"><a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;23:20-21</a></span> Now understand that He who led your fathers into the land is called by this name Jesus, and first called Auses <span class="stiki" id="note012231"><a href="../bible/num013.htm#verse16">Numbers&nbsp;13:16</a>.</span> (Oshea). For if you shall understand this, you shall likewise perceive that the name of Him who said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, 'for My name is in Him,' was Jesus. For, indeed, He was also called <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Jacob's name was changed to this also. Now Isaiah shows that those <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who are sent to publish tidings from God are called His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For Isaiah says in a certain place, 'Send me.' <span class="stiki" id="note012232"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;6:8</a></span> And that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> whose name was changed, Jesus [Joshua], was strong and great, is manifest to all. If, then, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God revealed Himself in so many forms to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and to Jacob, and to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, how are we at a loss, and do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father of all things, it was possible for Him to be born man of the Virgin, especially after we have such  Scriptures, from which it can be plainly perceived that He became so according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father?</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 76. From other passages the same majesty and government of Christ are proved</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For when Daniel speaks of 'one like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>' who received the everlasting kingdom, does he not hint at this very thing? For he declares that, in saying 'like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>,' He appeared, and was man, but not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed. And the same thing he proclaimed in <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> when he speaks of this stone which was cut out without hands. For the expression 'it was cut out without hands' signified that it is not a work of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but [a work] of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father and God of all things, who brought Him forth. And when Isaiah says, 'Who shall declare His generation?' he meant that His descent could not be declared. Now no one who is a man of men has a descent that cannot be declared. And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says that He will wash His garments in the blood of the grape, does not this signify what I have now often told you is an obscure prediction, namely, that He had blood, but not from men; just as not man, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has begotten the blood of the vine? And when Isaiah calls Him the Angel of mighty counsel,  did he not foretell Him to be the Teacher of those truths which He did teach when He came [to earth]? For He alone taught openly those mighty counsels which the Father designed both for all those who have been and shall be well-pleasing to Him, and also for those who have rebelled against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whether men or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, when He said: 'They shall come from the east [and from the west ], and shall sit down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>: but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.' <span class="stiki" id="note012236"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;8:11</a></span> And, 'Many shall say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten, and drunk, and prophesied, and cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in Your name? And I will say to them, Depart from Me.' <span class="stiki" id="note012237"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;7:22</a></span> Again, in other words, by which He shall condemn those who are unworthy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, He said, 'Depart into outer darkness, which the Father has prepared for <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and his, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note012238"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> And again, in other words, He said, 'I give unto you power to tread on serpents, and on scorpions, and on <em>scolopendras</em>, and on all the might of the enemy.'  And now we, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus</a>, who was crucified under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, when we <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcise</a> all <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, have them subjected to us. For if the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> declared obscurely that Christ would suffer, and thereafter be Lord of all, yet that [declaration] could not be understood by any man until He Himself persuaded the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> that such statements were expressly related in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For He exclaimed before His crucifixion: 'The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must suffer many  things, and be rejected by the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.' <span class="stiki" id="note012240"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;9:22</a></span> And David predicted that He would be born from the womb before sun and moon,  according to the Father's will, and made Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, being Christ, as God strong and to be worshipped.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 77. He returns to explain the prophecy of Isaiah</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> I admit that such and so great arguments are sufficient to persuade one; but I wish [you] to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I ask you for the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> which you have frequently proposed to give me. Proceed then to make this plain to us, that we may see how you prove that that [passage] refers to this Christ of yours. For we assert that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> relates to Hezekiah.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> I shall do as you wish. But show me yourselves first of all how it is said of Hezekiah, that before he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to call father or mother, he received the power of Damascus and the spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> in the presence of the king of Assyria. For it will not be conceded to you, as you wish to explain it, that Hezekiah waged <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the inhabitants of Damascus and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> in presence of the king of Assyria. 'For before the child <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to call father or mother,' the prophetic word said, 'He shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> in presence of the king of Assyria.' For if the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> had not made the statement with an addition, 'Before the child <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to call father or mother, he shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>,' but had only said, 'And shall bear a son, and he shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>,' then you might say that God foretold that he would take these things, since He foreknew it. But now the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> has stated it with this addition: 'Before the child <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to call father or mother, he shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.' And you cannot prove that such a thing ever happened to any one among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But we are able to prove that it happened in the case of our Christ. For at the time of His birth, <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> who came from Arabia worshipped Him, coming first to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, who then was sovereign in your land, and whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> calls king of Assyria on account of his ungodly and sinful character. For you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> oftentimes announces such events by <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and similitudes; just as He did towards all the people in Jerusalem, frequently saying to them, 'Your father is an Amorite, and your mother a Hittite.' <span class="stiki" id="note012242"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse3">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:3</a></span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 78. He proves that this prophecy harmonizes with Christ alone, from what is afterwards written</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Now this king <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, at the time when the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> came to him from Arabia, and said they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> from a star which appeared in the heavens that a King had been born in your country, and that they had come to worship Him, learned from the elders of your people that it was thus written regarding <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: 'And you, <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, in the land of Judah, art by no means least among the princes of Judah; for out of you shall go forth the leader who shall feed my people.' <span class="stiki" id="note012243"><a href="../bible/mic005.htm#verse2">Micah&nbsp;5:2</a></span> Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>  from Arabia came to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> and worshipped the Child, and presented Him with gifts, gold and frankincense, and myrrh; but returned not to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, being warned in a revelation after worshipping the Child in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. And Joseph, the spouse of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, who wished at first to put away his <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> Mary, supposing her to be pregnant by intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, i.e., from fornication, was commanded in a vision not to put away his wife; and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who appeared to him told him that what is in her womb is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Then he was afraid, and did not put her away; but on the occasion of the first census which was taken in Jud&aelig;a, under Cyrenius, he went up from <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, where he lived, to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, to which he belonged, to be enrolled; for his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, which then inhabited that region. Then along with Mary he is ordered to proceed into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and remain there with the Child until another revelation warn them to return into Jud&aelig;a. But when the Child was born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, since Joseph could not find a lodging in that village, he took up his quarters in a certain cave near the village; and while they were there Mary brought forth the Christ and placed Him in a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>, and here the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> who came from Arabia found Him.</p>

<p>I have repeated to you what Isaiah foretold about the sign which foreshadowed the cave; but for the sake of those who have come with us today, I shall again remind you of the passage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then I repeated the passage from Isaiah which I have already written, adding that, by means of those words, those who presided over the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a> were stirred up by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to say that in a place, called among them a cave, they were initiated by him. </p>

<blockquote><p>So <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> from Arabia did not return to him, as he had asked them to do, but had departed by another way to their own country, according to the commands laid on them; and when Joseph, with Mary and the Child, had now gone into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, as it was revealed to them to do; as he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Child whom the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> had gone to worship, ordered simply the whole of the children then in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> to be massacred. And Jeremiah prophesied that this would happen, speaking by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> thus: 'A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and much wailing, Rachel weeping for her children; and she would not be comforted, because they are not.' <span class="stiki" id="note012245"><a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse15">Jeremiah&nbsp;31:15</a></span> Therefore, on account of the voice which would be heard from Ramah, i.e., from Arabia (for there is in Arabia at this very time a place called Rama), wailing would come on the place where Rachel the wife of Jacob called <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patriarch, has been buried, i.e., on <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> weep for their own slaughtered children, and have no consolation by reason of what has happened to them. For that expression of Isaiah 'He shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>,' foretold that the power of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> that dwelt in Damascus should be overcome by Christ as soon as He was born; and this is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have happened. For the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, who were held in bondage  for the commission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> through the power of that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, by coming to worship Christ, shows that they have revolted from that dominion which held them captive; and this [dominion] the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has showed us to reside in Damascus. Moreover, that sinful and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> power is termed well in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.  And none of you can deny that Damascus was, and is, in the region of Arabia, although now it belongs to what is called Syroph&oelig;nicia. Hence it would be becoming for you, sirs, to learn what you have not perceived, from those who have received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, from us <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; and not to strive in every way to maintain your own doctrines, dishonouring those of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore also this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has been transferred to us, as Isaiah says, speaking to the following effect: 'This people draws near to Me, they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me; but in vain they worship Me, teaching the commands and doctrines of men. Therefore, behold, I will proceed  to remove this people, and I shall remove them; and I shall take away the wisdom of their wise men, and bring to nothing the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> men.' <span class="stiki" id="note012249"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13-14</a></span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 79. He proves against Trypho that the wicked angels have revolted from God</h2>

<p>Trypho, who was somewhat <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, but respected the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, as was manifest from his countenance, said to me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> The utterances of God are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, but your expositions are mere contrivances, as is plain from what has been explained by you; nay, even <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, for you assert that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and revolted from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>And I, wishing to get him to listen to me, answered in milder tones, thus:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> I admire, sir, this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of yours; and I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you may entertain the same disposition towards Him to whom <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are recorded to minister, as Daniel says; for [one] like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is led to the Ancient of days, and every kingdom is given to Him for ever and ever. But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, sir, that it is not our audacity which has induced us to adopt this exposition, which you reprehend, I shall give you evidence from Isaiah himself; for he affirms that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have dwelt and do dwell in Tanis, in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. These are [his] words: 'Woe to the rebellious children! Thus says the Lord, You have taken counsel, but not through Me; and [made] agreements, but not through My Spirit, to add <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>  in going down to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (but they have not inquired at Me), that they may be assisted by <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, and be covered with the shadow of the Egyptians. For the shadow of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> shall be a disgrace to you, and a reproach to those who trust in the Egyptians; for the princes in Tanis  are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. In vain will they labour for a people which will not profit them by assistance, but [will be] for a disgrace and a reproach [to them].' <span class="stiki" id="note012252"><a href="../bible/isa030.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;30:1-5</a></span> And, further, Zechariah tells, as you yourself have related, that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> stood on the right hand of Joshua the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, to resist him; and [the Lord] said, 'The Lord, who has taken  Jerusalem, rebuke you.' <span class="stiki" id="note012254"><a href="../bible/zec003.htm#verse1">Zechariah&nbsp;3:1</a></span> And again, it is written in Job, <span class="stiki" id="note012255"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse6">Job&nbsp;1:6</a></span> as you said yourself, how that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> came to stand before the Lord, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> came with them. And we have it recorded by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the beginning of Genesis, that the serpent beguiled Eve, and was cursed. And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> there were magicians who emulated  the mighty power displayed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the faithful servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. And you are aware that David said, 'The gods of the nations are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 80. The opinion of Justin with regard to the reign of a thousand years. Several Catholics reject it</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> I remarked to you sir, that you are very anxious to be safe in all respects, since you cling to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. But tell me, do you really admit that this place, Jerusalem, shall be rebuilt; and do you expect your people to be gathered together, and made joyful with Christ and the patriarchs, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, both the men of our nation, and other proselytes who joined them before your Christ came? Or have you given way, and admitted this in order to have the appearance of worsting us in the controversies?</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> I am not so miserable a fellow, Trypho, as to say one thing and think another. I admitted to you formerly,  that I and many others are of this opinion, and [<a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>] that such will take place, as you assuredly are aware;  but, on the other hand, I signified to you that many who belong to the pure and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, think otherwise. Moreover, I pointed out to you that some who are called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but are godless, impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, teach doctrines that are in every way <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>, <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistical</a>, and foolish. But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I do not say this before you alone, I shall draw up a statement, so far as I can, of all the arguments which have passed between us; in which I shall record myself as admitting the very same things which I admit to you.  For I choose to follow not men or men's doctrines, but God and the doctrines [delivered] by Him. For if you have fallen in with some who are called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but who do not admit this [<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>],  and venture to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob; who say there is no resurrection of the dead, and that their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, when they die, are taken to heaven; do not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, even as one, if he would rightly consider it, would not admit that the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, or similar <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of Genist&aelig;, Merist&aelig;,  Galil&aelig;ans, Hellenists,  <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, Baptists, are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (do not hear me impatiently when I tell you what I think), but are [only] called <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worshipping</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the lips, as God Himself declared, but the heart was far from Him. But I and others, who are right-minded <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> on all points, are assured that there will be a resurrection of the dead, and a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a>  in Jerusalem, which will then be built, adorned, and enlarged, [as] the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> Ezekiel and Isaiah and others declare.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 81. He endeavours to prove this opinion from Isaiah and the Apocalypse</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For Isaiah spoke thus concerning this space of a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a>:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>For there shall be the new heaven and the new earth, and the former shall not be remembered, or come into their heart; but they shall find <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> in it, which things I create. For, Behold, I make Jerusalem a rejoicing, and My people a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; and I shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over Jerusalem, and be glad over My people. And the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, or the voice of crying. And there shall be no more there a person of immature years, or an old man who shall not fulfil his days.  For the young man shall be an hundred years old;  but the sinner who dies an hundred years old,  he shall be accursed. And they shall build houses, and shall themselves inhabit them; and they shall plant vines, and shall themselves eat the produce of them, and drink the wine. They shall not build, and others inhabit; they shall not plant, and others eat. For according to the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people; the works of their toil shall abound.  Mine elect shall not toil fruitlessly, or beget children to be cursed; for they shall be a seed righteous and blessed by the Lord, and their offspring with them. And it shall come to pass, that before they call I will hear; while they are still speaking, I shall say, What is it? Then shall the wolves and the lambs feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent [shall eat] earth as bread. They shall not hurt or maltreat each other on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain, says the Lord. </em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Now we have understood that the expression used among these words, 'According to the days of the tree [of life ] shall be the days of my people; the works of their toil shall abound' obscurely predicts a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was told that in the day he ate of the tree he would die, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he did not  complete a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a>. We have perceived, moreover, that the expression, 'The day of the Lord is as a thousand years,'  is connected with this subject. And further, there was a certain man with us, whose name was John, one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who prophesied, by a revelation that was made to him, that those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in our Christ would dwell  a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a> in Jerusalem; and that thereafter the general, and, in short, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> resurrection and judgment of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> would likewise take place. Just as our Lord also said, 'They shall neither marry nor be given in marriage, but shall be equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the children of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the resurrection.' <span class="stiki" id="note012273"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;20:35</a>f.</span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 82. The prophetical gifts of the Jews were transferred to the Christians</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For the prophetical gifts remain with us, even to the present time. And hence you ought to understand that [the gifts] formerly among your nation have been transferred to us. And just as there were <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> contemporaneous with your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, so are there now many false teachers among us, of whom our Lord forewarned us to beware; so that in no respect are we deficient, since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He foreknew all that would happen to us after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the dead and ascension to heaven. For He said we would be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> for His name's sake; and that many <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> and false Christs would appear in His name, and deceive many: and so has it come about. For many have taught godless, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> doctrines, forging them in His name; have taught, too, and even yet are teaching, those things which proceed from the unclean spirit of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and which were put into their hearts. Therefore we are most anxious that you be persuaded not to be misled by such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that every one who can speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and yet speaks it not, shall be judged by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as God testified by Ezekiel, when He said, 'I have made you a watchman to the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a>. If the sinner <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and you warn him not, he himself shall die in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but his blood will I require at your hand. But if you warn him, you shall be innocent.'  And on this account we are, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, very earnest in desiring to converse [with men] according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, but not from <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, or of pleasure. For no man can convict us of any of these [<a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>]. No more do we wish to live like the rulers of your people, whom God reproaches when He says, 'Your rulers are companions of thieves, lovers of <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>, followers of the rewards.' <span class="stiki" id="note012275"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse23">Isaiah&nbsp;1:23</a></span> Now, if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> certain among us to be of this sort, do not for their sakes <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and do not assiduously strive to give falsified interpretations.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 83. It is proved that the Psalm, <q>The Lord said to My Lord,</q> etc., does not suit Hezekiah</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For your teachers have ventured to refer the passage, 'The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool,' to Hezekiah; as if he were requested to sit on the right side of the temple, when the king of Assyria sent to him and threatened him; and he was told by Isaiah not to be afraid. Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and admit that what Isaiah said took place; that the king of Assyria desisted from waging <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Jerusalem in Hezekiah's days, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord slew about 185, 000 of the host of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>. But it is manifest that the Psalm does not refer to him. For thus it is written,</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool. He shall send forth a rod of power over  Jerusalem, and it shall rule in the midst of Your  enemies.

<blockquote><p>Who does not admit, then, that Hezekiah is no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>? And who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he is not the redeemer of Jerusalem? And who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he neither sent a rod of power into Jerusalem, nor ruled in the midst of his enemies; but that it was God who averted from him the enemies, after he mourned and was afflicted? But our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, who has not yet come in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, has sent into Jerusalem a rod of power, namely, the word of calling and repentance [meant] for all nations over which <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> held sway, as David says, 'The gods of the nations are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.' And His strong word has prevailed on many to forsake the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> whom they used to serve, and by means of it to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> because the gods of the nations are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.  And we mentioned formerly that the statement, 'In the splendour of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> before the morning star have I begotten You from the womb,' is made to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 84. That prophecy, <q>Behold, a virgin,</q> etc., suits Christ alone</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, 'Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,' was uttered respecting Him. For if He to whom Isaiah referred was not to be begotten of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, of whom  did the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> declare, 'Behold, the Lord Himself shall give us a sign: behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear a son?' For if He also were to be begotten of sexual intercourse, like all other <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> sons, why did God say that He would give a sign which is not common to all the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> sons? But that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a sign, and which was to be made trustworthy to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>&mdash;namely, that the first-begotten of all creation should become incarnate by the Virgin's womb, and be a child&mdash;this he anticipated by the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and predicted it, as I have repeated to you, in various ways; in order that, when the event should take place, it might be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the operation of the power and will of the Maker of all things; just as Eve was made from one of Adam's ribs, and as all living beings were created in the beginning by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But you in these matters venture to pervert the expositions which your elders that were with Ptolemy king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> gave forth, since you assert that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> is not so as they have expounded it, but says, 'Behold, the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall conceive,' as if great events were to be inferred if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should beget from sexual intercourse: which indeed all young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, with the exception of the barren, do; but even these, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if He wills, is able to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> [to bear]. For Samuel's mother, who was barren, brought forth by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and so also the wife of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; and <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a>, who bore John the Baptist, and other such. So that you must not suppose that it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to do anything He wills. And especially when it was predicted that this would take place, do not venture to pervert or misinterpret the prophecies, since you will injure yourselves alone, and will not harm God.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 85. He proves that Christ is the Lord of Hosts from Psalm 24, and from his authority over demons</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Moreover, some of you venture to expound the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which runs, 'Lift up your gates, you rulers; and be lifted up, you everlasting doors, that the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may enter,'  as if it referred likewise to Hezekiah, and others of you [expound it] of Solomon; but neither to the latter nor to the former, nor, in short, to any of your kings, can it be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have reference, but to this our Christ alone, who appeared without comeliness, and inglorious, as Isaiah and David and all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> said; who is the Lord of hosts, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father who conferred on Him [the dignity]; who also rose from the dead, and ascended to heaven, as the Psalm and the other Scriptures manifested when they announced Him to be Lord of hosts; and of this you may, if you will, easily be persuaded by the occurrences which take place before your eyes. For every <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, when exorcised in the name of this very <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>&mdash;who is the First-born of every creature, who became man by the Virgin, who suffered, and was crucified under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> by your nation, who died, who rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven&mdash;is overcome and subdued. But though you <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcise</a> any <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> in the name of any of those who were among you&mdash;either kings, or righteous men, or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, or patriarchs&mdash;it will not be subject to you. But if any of you <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcise</a> it in [the name of] the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob, it will perhaps be subject to you. Now assuredly your exorcists, I have said,  make use of craft when they <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcise</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> do, and employ fumigations and incantations.  But that they are <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and powers whom the word of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> by David [commands] to lift up the gates, that He who rose from the dead, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Lord of hosts, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, might enter, the word of David has likewise showed; which I shall again recall to your attention for the sake of those who were not with us yesterday, for whose benefit, moreover, I sum up many things I said yesterday. And now, if I say this to you, although I have repeated it many times, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is not absurd so to do. For it is a ridiculous thing to see the sun, and the moon, and the other stars, continually keeping the same course, and bringing round the different seasons; and to see the computer who may be asked how many are twice two, because he has frequently said that they are four, not ceasing to say again that they are four; and equally so other things, which are confidently admitted, to be continually mentioned and admitted in like manner; yet that he who founds his discourse on the prophetic Scriptures should leave them and abstain from constantly referring to the same Scriptures, because it is thought he can bring forth something better than Scripture. The passage, then, by which I <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that God reveals that there are both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and hosts in heaven is this: 'Praise  the Lord from the heavens: praise Him in the highest. Praise Him, all His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: praise Him, all His hosts.' </p>

<p><strong>Mnaseas (one of those who had come with them on the second day):</strong> We are greatly pleased that you undertake to repeat the same things on our account.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Listen, my friends, to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> which induces me to act thus. Jesus commanded [us] to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> even [our] enemies, as was predicted by Isaiah in many passages, in which also is contained the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our own regeneration, as well, in fact, as the regeneration of all who expect that Christ will appear in Jerusalem, and by their works endeavour earnestly to please Him. These are the words spoken by Isaiah: 'Hear the word of the Lord, you that tremble at His word. Say, our brethren, to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you and detest you, that the name of the Lord has been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. He has appeared to your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and they shall be ashamed. A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple,  a voice of the Lord who renders recompense to the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. Before she that travailed brought forth, and before the pains of labour came, she brought forth a male child. Who has heard such a thing? And who has seen such a thing? Has the earth brought forth in one day? And has she produced a nation at once? For Zion has travailed and borne her children. But I have given such an expectation even to her that does not bring forth, said the Lord. Behold, I have made her that begets, and her that is barren, says the Lord. Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and hold a joyous assembly, all you that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> her. Be glad, all you that mourn for her, that you may nurse and be filled with the breast of her consolation, that having suck you may be delighted with the entrance of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note012285"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;66:5-11</a></span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 86. There are various figures in the Old Testament of the wood of the cross by which Christ reigned</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Hear, then, how this Man, of whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> declare that He will come again in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> after His crucifixion, was symbolized both by the tree of life, which was said to have been planted in paradise, and by those events which should happen to all the just. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was sent with a rod to effect the redemption of the people; and with this in his hands at the head of the people, he divided the sea. By this he saw the water gushing out of the rock; and when he cast a tree into the waters of Marah, which were bitter, he made them sweet. Jacob, by putting rods into the water-troughs, caused the sheep of his uncle to conceive, so that he should obtain their young. With his rod the same Jacob boasts that he had crossed the river. He said he had seen a ladder, and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has declared that God stood above it. But that this was not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. And Jacob, having poured oil on a stone in the same place, is testified to by the very God who appeared to him, that he had anointed a pillar to the God who appeared to him. And that the stone <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolically</a> proclaimed Christ, we have also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by many Scriptures; and that the ointment, whether it was of oil, or of <em>stacte</em>,  or of any other compounded sweet balsams, had reference to Him, we have also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>,  inasmuch as the word says: 'Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above Your fellows.'  For indeed all kings and anointed <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> obtained from Him their share in the names of kings and anointed: just as He Himself received from the Father the titles of King, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and Priest, and Angel, and such like other titles which He bears or did bear. <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron's</a> rod, which blossomed, declared him to be the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>. Isaiah prophesied that a rod would come forth from the root of Jesse, [and this was] Christ. And David says that the righteous man is 'like the tree that is planted by the channels of waters, which should yield its fruit in its season, and whose leaf should not fade.'  Again, the righteous is said to flourish like the palm-tree. God appeared from a tree to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, as it is written, near the oak in Mamre. The people found seventy willows and twelve springs after crossing the Jordan.  David affirms that God comforted him with a rod and staff. Elisha, by casting a stick  into the river Jordan, recovered the iron part of the axe with which the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had gone to cut down trees to build the house in which they wished to read and study the law and commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; even as our Christ, by being crucified on the tree, and by purifying [us] with water, has redeemed us, though plunged in the direst offenses which we have committed, and has made [us] a house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and adoration. Moreover, it was a rod that pointed out Judah to be the father of Tamar's sons by a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 87. Trypho maintains in objection these words: <q>And shall rest on Him,</q> etc. They are explained by Justin</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Do not now suppose that I am endeavouring, by asking what I do ask, to overturn the statements you have made; but I wish to receive information respecting those very points about which I now inquire. Tell me, then, how, when the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> asserts by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, 'There shall come forth a rod from the root of Jesse; and a flower shall grow up from the root of Jesse; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>: and the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord shall fill Him:'  (now you admitted to me that this referred to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and you maintain Him to be pre-existent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and having become incarnate by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, to be born man by the Virgin:) how He can be demonstrated to have been pre-existent, who is filled with the powers of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> by Isaiah enumerates, as if He were in lack of them?</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> You have inquired most discreetly and most prudently, for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> there does seem to be a difficulty; but listen to what I say, that you may perceive the reason of this also. The <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that these enumerated powers of the Spirit have come on Him, not because He stood in need of them, but because they would rest in Him, i.e., would find their accomplishment in Him, so that there would be no more <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in your nation after the ancient custom: and this fact you plainly perceive. For after Him no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has arisen among you. Now, that [you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that] your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, each receiving some one or two powers from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, did and spoke the things which we have learned from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, attend to the following remarks of mine. Solomon possessed the spirit of wisdom, Daniel that of understanding and counsel, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that of might and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, Elijah that of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and Isaiah that of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and so with the others: each possessed one power, or one joined alternately with another; also Jeremiah, and the twelve [<a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>], and David, and, in short, the rest who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> among you. Accordingly He  rested, i.e., ceased, when <em>He</em> came, after whom, in the times of this dispensation wrought out by Him among men,  it was requisite that such gifts should cease from you; and having received their rest in Him, should again, as had been predicted, become gifts which, from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His Spirit's power, He imparts to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, according as He deems each man worthy thereof. I have already said, and do again say, that it had been prophesied that this would be done by Him after His ascension to heaven. It is accordingly said,  'He ascended on high, He led captivity captive, He gave gifts unto the sons of men.' And again, in another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> it is said: 'And it shall come to pass after this, I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh, and on My servants, and on My handmaids, and they shall prophesy.' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 88. Christ has not received the Holy Spirit on account of poverty</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Now, it is possible to see among us <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and men who possess gifts of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>; so that it was prophesied that the powers enumerated by Isaiah would come upon Him, not because He needed power, but because these would not continue after Him. And let this be a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to you, namely, what I told you was done by the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> from Arabia, who as soon as the Child was born came to worship Him, for even at His birth He was in possession of His power; and as He grew up like all other men, by using the fitting means, He assigned its own [requirements] to each development, and was sustained by all kinds of nourishment, and waited for thirty years, more or less, until John appeared before Him as the herald of His approach, and preceded Him in the way of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as I have already shown. And then, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had gone to the river Jordan, where John was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, and when He had stepped into the water, a fire  was kindled in the Jordan; and when He came out of the water, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> lighted on Him like a dove, [as] the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of this very Christ of ours wrote. Now, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he did not go to the river because He stood in need of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or of the descent of the Spirit like a dove; even as He submitted to be born and to be crucified, not because He needed such things, but because of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, which from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had fallen under the power of death and the guile of the serpent, and each one of which had committed personal transgression. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wishing both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men, who were endowed with <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and at their own disposal, to do whatever He had strengthened each to do, made them so, that if they chose the things acceptable to Himself, He would keep them free from death and from punishment; but that if they did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, He would punish each as He sees fit. For it was not His entrance into Jerusalem sitting on an ass, which we have showed was prophesied, that empowered Him to be Christ, but it furnished men with a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that He is the Christ; just as it was necessary in the time of John that men have  <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For when John remained  by the Jordan, and preached the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of repentance, wearing only a leathern girdle and a vesture made of camels' hair, eating nothing but locusts and wild honey, men supposed him to be Christ; but he cried to them, 'I am not the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, but the voice of one crying; for He that is stronger than I shall come, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear.' <span class="stiki" id="note012299"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse27">Isaiah&nbsp;1:27</a></span> And when Jesus came to the Jordan, He was considered to be the son of Joseph the carpenter; and He appeared without comeliness, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> declared; and He was deemed a carpenter (for He was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of working as a carpenter when among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, making ploughs and yokes; by which He taught the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of righteousness and an active life); but then the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and for man's sake, as I formerly stated, lighted on Him in the form of a dove, and there came at the same instant from the heavens a voice, which was uttered also by David when he spoke, personating Christ, what the Father would say to Him: 'You are My Son: this day have I begotten You;'  [the Father] saying that His generation would take place for men, at the time when they would become acquainted with Him: 'You are My Son; this day have I begotten you.' </p></blockquote>
