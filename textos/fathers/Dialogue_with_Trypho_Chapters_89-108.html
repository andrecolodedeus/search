<h1>Dialogue with Trypho (Chapters 89-108)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 89. The cross alone is offensive to Trypho on account of the curse, yet it proves that Jesus is Christ</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Be assured that all our nation waits for Christ; and we admit that all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which you have quoted refer to Him. Moreover, I do also admit that the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, by which the the son of Nave (Nun) was called, has inclined me very strongly to adopt this view. But whether Christ should be so shamefully crucified, this we are in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about. For whosoever is crucified is said in the law to be accursed, so that I am exceedingly incredulous on this point. It is quite clear, indeed, that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> announce that Christ had to suffer; but we wish to learn if you can prove it to us whether it was by the suffering cursed in the law.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> If Christ was not to suffer, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had not foretold that He would be led to death on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people, and be dishonoured and scourged, and reckoned among the transgressors, and as a sheep be led to the slaughter, whose generation, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, no man can declare, then you would have good <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to wonder. But if these are to be characteristic of Him and mark Him out to all, how is it possible for us to do anything else than <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him most confidently? And will not as many as have understood the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, whenever they hear merely that He was crucified, say that this is He and no other?</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 90. The stretched-out hands of Moses signified beforehand the cross</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Bring us on, then, by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, that we may also be persuaded by you; for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He should suffer and be led as a sheep. But prove to us whether He must be crucified and die so disgracefully and so dishonourably by the death cursed in the law.  For we cannot bring ourselves even to think of this.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that what the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> said and did they veiled by <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and types, as you admitted to us; so that it was not easy for all to understand the most [of what they said], since they concealed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by these means, that those who are eager to find out and learn it might do so with much labour.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho's group:</strong> We admitted this.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> Listen, therefore, to what follows; for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> first exhibited this seeming curse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> by the signs which he made.</p>

<p><strong>Trypho:</strong> Of what [signs] do you speak?</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong> When the people waged <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Amalek, and the son of Nave (Nun) by name Jesus (Joshua), led the fight, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, stretching out both hands, and Hur with <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> supported them during the whole day, so that they might not hang down when he got wearied. For if he gave up any part of this sign, which was an imitation of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, the people were beaten, as is recorded in the writings of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; but if he remained in this form, Amalek was proportionally defeated, and he who prevailed prevailed by the cross. For it was not because <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> so <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the people were stronger, but because, while one who bore the name of Jesus (Joshua) was in the forefront of the battle, he himself made the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>. For who of you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of one who accompanies it with lamentation and tears, with the body prostrate, or with bended knees, propitiates God most of all? But in such a manner neither he nor any other one, while sitting on a stone, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. Nor even the stone symbolized Christ, as I have shown.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 91. The cross was foretold in the blessings of Joseph, and in the serpent that was lifted up</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And God by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> shows in another way the force of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, when He said in the blessing wherewith Joseph was blessed,  'From the blessing of the Lord is his land; for the seasons of heaven, and for the dews, and for the deep springs from beneath, and for the seasonable fruits of the sun,  and for the coming together of the months, and for the heights of the everlasting mountains, and for the heights of the hills, and for the ever-flowing rivers, and for the fruits of the fatness of the earth; and let the things accepted by Him who appeared in the bush come on the head and crown of Joseph. Let him be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among his brethren;  his beauty is [like] the firstling of a bullock; his horns the horns of an unicorn: with these shall he push the nations from one end of the earth to another.' <span class="stiki" id="note012305"><a href="../bible/deu033.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy&nbsp;33:13-17</a></span> Now, no one could say or prove that the horns of an unicorn represent any other fact or figure than the type which portrays the cross. For the one beam is placed upright, from which the highest extremity is raised up into a horn, when the other beam is fitted on to it, and the ends appear on both sides as horns joined on to the one horn. And the part which is fixed in the centre, on which are suspended those who are crucified, also stands out like a horn; and it also looks like a horn conjoined and fixed with the other horns. And the expression, 'With these shall he push as with horns the nations from one end of the earth to another,' is indicative of what is now the fact among all the nations. For some out of all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, through the power of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, having been so pushed, that is, pricked in their hearts, have turned from vain <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to serve God. But the same figure is revealed for the destruction and condemnation of the unbelievers; even as Amalek was defeated and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> victorious when the people came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, by means of the type of the stretching out of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> hands, and the name of Jesus (Joshua), by which the son of Nave (Nun) was called. And it seems that the type and sign, which was erected to counteract the serpents which bit <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, was intended for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that death was declared to come thereafter on the serpent through Him that would be crucified, but <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to those who had been bitten by him and had betaken themselves to Him that sent His Son into the world to be crucified.  For the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did not teach us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the serpent, since it shows us that he was cursed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the beginning; and in Isaiah tells us that he shall be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> as an enemy by the mighty sword, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 92. Unless the scriptures be understood through God's great grace, God will not appear to have taught always the same righteousness</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Unless, therefore, a man by God's great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> receives the power to understand what has been said and done by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the appearance of being able to repeat the words or the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> will not profit him, if he cannot explain the argument of them. And will they not assuredly appear contemptible to many, since they are related by those who understood them not? For if one should wish to ask you why, since <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> with his sons, and all others in similar circumstances, who neither were <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> nor kept the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God demanded by other leaders, and by the giving of the law after the lapse of so many generations, that those who lived between the times of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> be justified by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and that those who lived after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> be justified by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the other ordinances&mdash;to wit, the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and libations,  and offerings; [God will be <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a>] unless you show, as I have already said, that God who foreknew was aware that your nation would deserve expulsion from Jerusalem, and that none would be permitted to enter into it. (For  you are not distinguished in any other way than by the fleshly <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, as I remarked previously. For <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was declared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be righteous, not on account of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, but on account of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For before he was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the following statement was made regarding him: '<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness.' <span class="stiki" id="note012309"><a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;15:6</a></span> And we, therefore, in the uncircumcision of our flesh, believing God through Christ, and having that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> which is of advantage to us who have acquired it&mdash;namely, that of the heart&mdash;we hope to appear righteous before and well-pleasing to God: since already we have received His testimony through the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.) [And, further, God will be <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> unless you show] that you were commanded to observe the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and to present offerings, and that the Lord submitted to have a place called by the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that, as has been said, you might not become impious and godless by worshipping <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and forgetting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as indeed you do always appear to have been. (Now, that God enjoined the ordinances of <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> and offerings for these reasons, I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in what I previously remarked; but for the sake of those who came today, I  wish to repeat nearly the whole.) For if this is not the case, God will be <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a>,  as having no foreknowledge, and as not teaching all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and to do the same acts of righteousness (for many generations of men appear to have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>); and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which affirms that 'God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and righteous, and all His ways are judgments, and there is no unrighteousness in him.' But since the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, God is always willing that such even as you be neither foolish nor lovers of yourselves, in order that you may obtain the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,  who pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and received testimony from Him, as I have already said, by alleging <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> words of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 93. The same kind of righteousness is bestowed on all. Christ comprehends it in two precepts</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For [God] sets before every race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> that which is always and universally just, as well as all righteousness; and every race <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and fornication, and homicide,  and such like, are sinful; and though they all commit such practices, yet they do not escape from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that they act unrighteously whenever they so do, with the exception of those who are possessed with an unclean spirit, and who have been debased by education, by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> customs, and by sinful institutions, and who have lost, or rather quenched and put under, their natural ideas. For we may see that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are unwilling to submit to the same things which they inflict upon others, and reproach each other with hostile <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> for the acts which they perpetrate. And hence I think that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> spoke well when He summed up all righteousness and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in two commandments. They are these: 'You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your strength, and your neighbour as yourself.' <span class="stiki" id="note012313"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;22:37</a></span> For the man who loves God with all the heart, and with all the strength, being filled with a God-fearing <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, will reverence no other god; and since God wishes it, he would reverence that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who is beloved by the same Lord and God. And the man who loves his neighbour as himself will wish for him the same <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that he wishes for himself, and no man will wish <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things for himself. Accordingly, he who loves his neighbour would <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and labour that his neighbour may be possessed of the same benefits as himself. Now nothing else is neighbour to man than that similarly-affectioned and reasonable being&mdash;man. Therefore, since all righteousness is divided into two branches, namely, in so far as it regards God and men, whoever, says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, loves the Lord God with all the heart, and all the strength, and his neighbour as himself, would be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a righteous man. But you were never shown to be possessed of friendship or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> either towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or towards the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, or towards yourselves, but, as is evident, you are ever found to be idolaters and murderers of righteous men, so that you laid hands even on Christ Himself; and to this very day you abide in your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, execrating those who prove that this man who was crucified by you is the Christ. Nay, more than this, you suppose that He was crucified as hostile to and cursed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which supposition is the product of your most irrational mind. For though you have the means of understanding that this man is Christ from the signs given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, yet you will not; but, in addition, fancying that we can have no arguments, you put whatever question comes into your minds, while you yourselves are at a loss for arguments whenever you meet with some firmly established <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 94. In what sense he who hangs on a tree is cursed</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For tell me, was it not God who commanded by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that no image or likeness of anything which was in heaven above or which was on the earth should be made, and yet who caused the brazen serpent to be made by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the wilderness, and set it up for a sign by which those bitten by serpents were saved? Yet is He free from unrighteousness. For by this, as I previously remarked, He proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, by which He declared that He would break the power of the serpent which occasioned the transgression of Adam, and [would bring] to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him [who was foreshadowed] by this sign, i.e., Him who was to be crucified, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from the fangs of the serpent, which are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, idolatries, and other unrighteous acts. Unless the matter be so understood, give me a reason why <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> set up the brazen serpent for a sign, and bade those that were bitten gaze at it, and the wounded were healed; and this, too, when he had himself commanded that no likeness of anything whatsoever should be made.</p>

<p><strong>Another of those who came on the second day:</strong> You have spoken <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>: we cannot give a reason. For I have frequently interrogated the teachers about this matter, and none of them gave me a reason: therefore continue what you are speaking; for we are paying attention while you unfold the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, on account of which the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Justin:</strong>  Just as God commanded the sign to be made by the brazen serpent, and yet He is blameless; even so, though a curse lies in the law against <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are crucified, yet no curse lies on the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom all that have committed things worthy of a curse are saved. <span class="stiki" id="note012314"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians&nbsp;3:13</a>.</span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 95. Christ took upon Himself the curse due to us</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> will be found to be under a curse. For it is written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, 'Cursed is every one that continues not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.' <span class="stiki" id="note012315"><a href="../bible/deu027.htm#verse26">Deuteronomy&nbsp;27:26</a></span> And no one has accurately done all, nor will you venture to deny this; but some more and some less than others have observed the ordinances enjoined. But if those who are under this law appear to be under a curse for not having observed all the requirements, how much more shall all the nations appear to be under a curse who practise <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, who seduce youths, and commit other crimes? If, then, the Father of all wished His Christ for the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to take upon Him the curses of all, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that, after He had been crucified and was dead, He would raise Him up, why do you argue about Him, who submitted to suffer these things according to the Father's will, as if He were accursed, and do not rather bewail yourselves? For although His Father caused Him to suffer these things in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, yet you did not commit the deed as in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For you did not practise <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> when you slew the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And let none of you say: If His Father wished Him to suffer this, in order that by His stripes the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> might be healed, we have done no wrong. If, indeed, you repent of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and recognise Him to be Christ, and observe His commandments, then you may assert this; for, as I have said before, remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall be yours. But if you curse Him and them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, and, when you have the power, put them to death, how is it possible that requisition shall not be made of you, as of unrighteous and sinful men, altogether hard-hearted and without understanding, because you laid your hands on Him?</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 96. That curse was a prediction of the things which the Jews would do</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For the statement in the law, 'Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree,' <span class="stiki" id="note012316"><a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse23">Deuteronomy&nbsp;21:23</a></span> confirms our hope which depends on the crucified Christ, not because He who has been crucified is cursed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but because God foretold that which would be done by you all, and by those like to you, who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>  that this is He who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before all, who is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Priest of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and King, and Christ. And you clearly see that this has come to pass. For you curse in your <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> all those who are called  from Him <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; and other nations effectively carry out the curse, putting to death those who simply confess themselves to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; to all of whom we say, You are our brethren; rather recognise the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And while neither they nor you are persuaded by us, but strive earnestly to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us to deny the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we choose rather and submit to death, in the full assurance that all the good which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has promised through Christ He will reward us with. And in addition to all this we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you, that Christ may have mercy upon you. For He taught us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for our enemies also, saying, 'Love your enemies; be kind and merciful, as your heavenly Father is.' <span class="stiki" id="note012319"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;6:35</a></span> For we see that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> is kind and merciful, causing His sun to rise on the unthankful and on the righteous, and sending rain on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; all of whom He has taught us He will judge.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 97. Other predictions of the cross of Christ</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> For it was not without design that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when Hur and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> upheld his hands, remained in this form until evening. For indeed the Lord remained upon the tree almost until evening, and they buried Him at eventide; then on the third day He rose again. This was declared by David thus: 'With my voice I cried to the Lord, and He heard me out of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hill. I laid me down, and slept; I awoke, for the Lord sustained me.'  And Isaiah likewise mentions concerning Him the manner in which He would die, thus: 'I have spread out My hands unto a people disobedient, and gainsaying, that walk in a way which is not good.'  And that He would rise again, Isaiah himself said: 'His burial has been taken away from the midst, and I will give the rich for His death.' <span class="stiki" id="note012322"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;53:9</a></span> And again, in other words, David in the twenty-first  Psalm thus refers to the suffering and to the cross in a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>: 'They pierced my hands and my feet; they counted all my bones. They considered and gazed on me; they parted my garments among themselves, and cast lots upon my vesture.' For when they crucified Him, driving in the nails, they pierced His hands and feet; and those who crucified Him parted  His garments among themselves, each casting lots for what he chose to have, and receiving according to the decision of the lot. And this very Psalm you maintain does not refer to Christ; for you are in all respects blind, and do not understand that no one in your nation who has been called King or Christ has ever had his hands or feet pierced while alive, or has died in this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> fashion&mdash;to wit, by the cross&mdash;save this Jesus alone.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 98. Predictions of Christ in Psalm 22</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> I shall repeat the whole Psalm, in order that you may hear His reverence to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and how He refers all things to Him, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> to be delivered by Him from this death; at the same time declaring in the Psalm who they are that rise up against Him, and showing that He has <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> become man capable of suffering. It is as follows:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, attend to me: why have You forsaken me? The words of my transgressions are far from my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I will cry to You in the day-time, and You will not hear; and in the night-season, and it is not for want of understanding in me. But You, the Praise of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, inhabitest the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place. Our fathers trusted in You; they trusted, and You delivered them. They cried unto You, and were delivered: they trusted in You, and were not confounded. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and despised of the people. All they that see me laughed me to scorn; they spoke with the lips, they shook the head: He trusted on the Lord: let Him deliver him, let Him save him, since he desires Him. For You are He that took me out of the womb; my hope from the breasts of my mother: I was cast upon You from the womb. You are my God from my mother's belly: be not far from me, for trouble is near; for there is none to help. Many calves have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me round. They opened their mouth upon me, as a ravening and roaring lion. All my bones are poured out and dispersed like water. My heart has become like wax melting in the midst of my belly. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue has cleaved to my throat; and You have brought me into the dust of death. For many dogs have surrounded me; the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> have beset me round. They pierced my hands and my feet, they did tell all my bones. They did look and stare upon me; they parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. But do not remove Your assistance from me, O Lord: give heed to help me; deliver my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the sword, and my  only-begotten from the hand of the dog. Save me from the lion's mouth, and my humility from the horns of the unicorns. I will declare Your name to my brethren; in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> will I praise You. You that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord, praise Him: all you the seed of Jacob, glorify Him. Let all the seed of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him.</em></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 99. In the commencement of the Psalm are Christ's dying words</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Now I will demonstrate to you that the whole Psalm refers thus to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by the words which I shall again explain. What is said at first&mdash;'O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, attend to me: why have You forsaken me?'&mdash;announced from the beginning that which was to be said in the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For when crucified, He spoke: 'O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken me?' And what follows: 'The words of my transgressions are far from my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I will cry to You in the day-time, and You will not hear; and in the night-season, and it is not for want of understanding in me.' These, as well as the things which He was to do, were spoken. For on the day on which He was to be crucified,  having taken three of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to the hill called Olivet, situated opposite to the temple in Jerusalem, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in these words: 'Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.' <span class="stiki" id="note012326"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;26:39</a></span> And again He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>: 'Not as I will, but as You will.'  showing by this that He had become <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a suffering man. But lest any one should say, He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> then that He had to suffer, He adds immediately in the Psalm: 'And it is not for want of understanding in me.' Even as there was no <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> on God's part when He asked <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> where he was, or asked Cain where Abel was; but [it was done] to convince each what kind of man he was, and in order that through the record [of Scripture] we might have a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all: so likewise Christ declared that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> was not on His side, but on theirs, who thought that He was not the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, but fancied they would put Him to death, and that He, like some common mortal, would remain in Hades.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 100. In what sense Christ is [called] Jacob, and Israel, and Son of Man</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Then what follows&mdash;'But You, the praise of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, inhabitest the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place'&mdash;declared that He is to do something worthy of praise and wonderment, being about to rise again from the dead on the third day after the crucifixion; and this He has obtained from the Father. For I  have showed already that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called both Jacob and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that it is not in the blessing of Joseph and Judah alone that what relates to Him was proclaimed mysteriously, but also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> it is written that He said: 'All things are delivered unto me by My Father.' and, 'No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father but the Son; nor the Son but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and they to whom the Son will reveal Him.' <span class="stiki" id="note012328"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> Accordingly He revealed to us all that we have perceived by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, so that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him to be the first-begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to be before all creatures; likewise to be the Son of the patriarchs, since He assumed flesh by the Virgin of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and submitted to become a man without comeliness, dishonoured, and subject to suffering. Hence, also, among His words He said, when He was discoursing about His future sufferings: 'The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must suffer many things, and be rejected by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.' <span class="stiki" id="note012329"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;16:21</a></span> He said then that He was the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, either because of His birth by the Virgin, who was, as I said, of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David  and Jacob, and Isaac, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; or because Adam  was the father both of Himself and of those who have been first enumerated from whom Mary derives her descent. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the fathers of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are the fathers likewise of those children whom their daughters bear. For [Christ] called one of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>&mdash;previously <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the name of Simon&mdash;Peter; since he recognised Him to be Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, by the revelation of His Father: and since we find it recorded in the memoirs of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and since we call Him the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, we have understood that He proceeded before all creatures from the Father by His power and will (for He is addressed in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in one way or another as Wisdom, and the Day,  and the East, and a Sword, and a Stone, and a Rod, and Jacob, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>); and that He became man by the Virgin, in order that the disobedience which proceeded from the serpent might receive its destruction in the same manner in which it derived its origin. For Eve, who was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and undefiled, having conceived the word of the serpent, brought forth disobedience and death. But the Virgin Mary received <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Gabriel announced the good tidings to her that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> would come upon her, and the power of the Highest would overshadow her: wherefore also the Holy Thing begotten of her is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;  and she replied, 'Be it unto me according to your word.' <span class="stiki" id="note012334"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;1:38</a></span> And by her has He been born, to whom we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> so many Scriptures refer, and by whom God destroys both the serpent and those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men who are like him; but works deliverance from death to those who repent of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> upon Him.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 101. Christ refers all things to the Father</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Then what follows of the Psalm is this, in which He says: 'Our fathers trusted in You; they trusted, and You delivered them. They cried unto You, and were not confounded. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and despised of the people;' which show that He admits them to be His fathers, who trusted in God and were saved by Him, who also were the fathers of the Virgin, by whom He was born and became man; and He foretells that He shall be saved by the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but boasts not in accomplishing anything through His own will or might. For when on earth He acted in the very same manner, and answered to one who addressed Him as 'Good Master:' 'Why do you call me good? One is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, my Father who is in heaven.'  But when He says, 'I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and despised of the people,' He prophesied the things which do exist, and which happen to Him. For we who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him are everywhere a reproach, 'despised of the people;' for, rejected and dishonoured by your nation, He suffered those indignities which you planned against Him. And the following: 'All they that see me laughed me to scorn; they spoke with the lips, they shook the head: He trusted in the Lord; let Him deliver him, since he desires Him;' this likewise He foretold should happen to Him. For they that saw Him crucified shook their heads each one of them, and distorted their lips, and twisting their noses to each other,  they spoke in mockery the words which are recorded in the memoirs of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: 'He said he was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: let him come down; let God save him.'</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 102. The prediction of the events which happened to Christ when He was born. Why God permitted it</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And what follows&mdash;'My hope from the breasts of my mother. On You have I been cast from the womb; from my mother's belly You are my God: for there is no helper. Many calves have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me round. They opened their mouth upon me, as a ravening and a roaring lion. All my bones are poured out and dispersed like water. My heart has become likes wax melting in the midst of my belly. My strength has become dry like a potsherd; and my tongue has cleaved to my throat'&mdash;foretold what would come to pass; for the statement, 'My hope from the  breasts of my mother,' [is thus explained]. As soon as He was born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, as I previously remarked, king <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, having learned from the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> about Him, made a plot to put Him to death and by God's command Joseph took Him with Mary and departed into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. For the Father had decreed that He whom He had begotten should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, but not before He had grown to manhood, and proclaimed the word which proceeded from Him. But if any of you say to us, Could not God rather have put <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> to death? I return answer by anticipation: Could not God have cut off in the beginning the serpent, so that he exist not, rather than have said, 'And I will put enmity between him and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and between his seed and her seed?' <span class="stiki" id="note012337"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse15">Genesis&nbsp;3:15</a></span> Could He not have at once created a multitude of men? But yet, since He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it would be good, He created both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men free to do that which is righteous, and He appointed periods of time during which He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it would be good for them to have the exercise of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; and because He likewise <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it would be good, He made general and particular judgments; each one's freedom of will, however, being guarded. Hence <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says the following, at the destruction of the tower, and division and alteration of tongues: 'And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they have begun to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them of all which they have attempted to do.' <span class="stiki" id="note012338"><a href="../bible/gen011.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;11:6</a></span> And the statement, 'My strength has become dry like a potsherd, and my tongue has cleaved to my throat,' was also a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of what would be done by Him according to the Father's will. For the power of His strong word, by which He always confuted the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>, and, in short, all your nation's teachers that questioned Him, had a cessation like a plentiful and strong spring, the waters of which have been turned off, when He kept silence, and chose to return no answer to any one in the presence of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>; as has been declared in the memoirs of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in order that what is recorded by Isaiah might have efficacious fruit, where it is written, 'The Lord gives me a tongue, that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> when I ought to speak.' <span class="stiki" id="note012339"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;50:4</a></span> Again, when He said, 'You are my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; be not far from me,' He taught that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> ought to hope in God who created all things, and seek <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and help from Him alone; and not suppose, as the rest of men do, that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> can be obtained by birth, or <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, or strength, or wisdom. And such have ever been your practices: at one time you made a calf, and always you have shown yourselves ungrateful, murderers of the righteous, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of your descent. For if the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> evidently states that He can be saved, [neither]  because He is a son, nor because He is strong or wise, but that without God He cannot be saved, even though He be sinless, as Isaiah declares in words to the effect that even in regard to His very language He committed no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (for He committed no iniquity or guile with His mouth), how do you or others who expect to be saved without this hope, suppose that you are not deceiving yourselves?</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 103. The Pharisees are the bulls: the roaring lion is Herod or the devil</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> Then what is next said in the Psalm&mdash;'For trouble is near, for there is none to help me. Many calves have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me round. They opened their mouth upon me as a ravening and roaring lion. All my bones are poured out and dispersed like water,'&mdash;was likewise a prediction of the events which happened to Him. For on that night when some of your nation, who had been sent by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>, and teachers,  came upon Him from the Mount  of Olives, those whom Scripture called butting and prematurely destructive calves surrounded Him. And the expression, 'Fat bulls have beset me round,' He spoke beforehand of those who acted similarly to the calves, when He was led before your teachers. And the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> described them as bulls, since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that bulls are authors of calves' <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. As therefore the bulls are the begetters of the calves, so your teachers were the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why their children went out to the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a> to take Him and bring Him to them. And the expression, 'For there is none to help,' is also indicative of what took place. For there was not even a single man to assist Him as an innocent person. And the expression, 'They opened their mouth upon me like a roaring lion,'  designates him who was then king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and was called <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, a successor of the <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> who, when Christ was born, slew all the infants in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> born about the same time, because he imagined that among them He would assuredly be of whom the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> from Arabia had spoken; for he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that is stronger than all, how He had commanded <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> to take the Child and depart into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and there to remain until a revelation should again be made to them to return into their own country. And there they did remain until <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, who slew the infants in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, was dead, and Archelaus had succeeded him. And he died before Christ came to the dispensation on the cross which was given Him by His Father. And when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> succeeded Archelaus, having received the authority which had been allotted to him, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> sent to him by way of compliment Jesus bound; and God foreknowing that this would happen, had thus spoken: 'And they brought Him to the Assyrian, a present to the king.' <span class="stiki" id="note012343"><a href="../bible/hos010.htm#verse6">Hosea&nbsp;10:6</a></span> Or He meant the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by the lion roaring against Him: whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> calls the serpent, but in Job and Zechariah he is called the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and by Jesus is addressed as <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, showing that a compounded name was acquired by him from the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which he performed. For 'Sata' in the Jewish and Syrian tongue means <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>; and 'Nas' is the word from which he is called by interpretation the <em>serpent</em>, i.e., according to the interpretation of the Hebrew term, from both of which there arises the single word <em>Satanas</em>. For this <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, when [Jesus] went up from the river Jordan, at the time when the voice spoke to Him, 'You are my Son: this day have I begotten You,'  is recorded in the memoirs of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to have come to Him and tempted Him, even so far as to say to Him, 'Worship me;' and Christ answered him, 'Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: you shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.' <span class="stiki" id="note012345"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;4:9-10</a></span> For as he had deceived Adam, so he hoped  that he might contrive some mischief against Christ also. Moreover, the statement, 'All my bones are poured out  and dispersed like water; my heart has become like wax, melting in the midst of my belly,' was a prediction of that which happened to Him on that night when men came out against Him to the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a> to seize Him. For in the memoirs which I say were drawn up by His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and those who followed them, [it is recorded] that His sweat fell down like drops of blood while He was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, and saying, 'If it be possible, let this cup pass:' <span class="stiki" id="note012348"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;22:44,&nbsp;42</a></span> His heart and also His bones trembling; His heart being like wax melting in His belly:  in order that we may perceive that the Father wished His Son really  to undergo such sufferings for our sakes, and may not say that He, being the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, did not feel what was happening to Him and inflicted on Him. Further, the expression, 'My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue has cleaved to my throat,' was a prediction, as I previously remarked, of that silence, when He who convicted all your teachers of being unwise returned no answer at all.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 104. Circumstances of Christ's death are predicted in this Psalm</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And the statement, 'You have brought me into the dust of death; for many dogs have surrounded me: the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> have beset me round. They pierced my hands and my feet. They did tell all my bones. They did look and stare upon me. They parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture,'&mdash;was a prediction, as I said before, of the death to which the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> would condemn Him, whom He calls both dogs and hunters, declaring that those who hunted Him were both gathered together and assiduously striving to condemn Him. And this is recorded to have happened in the memoirs of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. And I have shown that, after His crucifixion, they who crucified Him parted His garments among them.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 105. The Psalm also predicts the crucifixion and the subject of the last prayers of Christ on Earth</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And what follows of the Psalm,&mdash;'But You, Lord, do not remove Your assistance from me; give heed to help me. Deliver my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the sword, and my  only-begotten from the hand of the dog; save me from the lion's mouth, and my humility from the horns of the unicorns,'&mdash;was also information and prediction of the events which should befall Him. For I have already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that He was the only-begotten of the Father of all things, being begotten in a peculiar manner Word and Power by Him, and having afterwards become man through the Virgin, as we have learned from the memoirs. Moreover, it is similarly foretold that He would die by crucifixion. For the passage, 'Deliver my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the sword, and my  only-begotten from the hand of the dog; save me from the lion's mouth, and my humility from the horns of the unicorns,' is indicative of the suffering by which He should  die, i.e., by crucifixion. For the 'horns of the, unicorns,' I have already explained to you, are the figure of the cross only. And the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be saved from the sword, and lion's mouth, and hand of the dog, was a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that no one should take possession of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: so that, when we arrive at the end of life, we may ask the same petition from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is able to turn away every shameless <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from taking our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. And that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> survive, I have shown  to you from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Samuel was called up by the witch, as Saul demanded. And it appears also, that all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of similar righteous men and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> fell under the dominion of such powers, as is indeed to be inferred from the very facts in the case of that witch. Hence also God by His Son teaches  us for whose sake these things seem to have been done, always to strive earnestly, and at death to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> may not fall into the hands of any such power. For when Christ was giving up His spirit on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, He said, 'Father, into Your hands I commend my spirit,' <span class="stiki" id="note012355"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;23:46</a></span> as I have learned also from the memoirs. For He exhorted His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to surpass the pharisaic way of living, with the warning, that if they did not, they might be sure they could not be saved; and these words are recorded in the memoirs: 'Unless your righteousness exceed that of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, you shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note012356"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;5:20</a></span> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 106. Christ's resurrection is foretold in the conclusion of the Psalm</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> The remainder of the Psalm makes it manifest that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> His Father would grant to Him all things which He asked, and would raise Him from the dead; and that He urged all who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God to praise Him because He had compassion on all races of believing men, through the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Him who was crucified; and that He stood in the midst of His brethren the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> (who repented of their flight from Him when He was crucified, after He rose from the dead, and after they were persuaded by Himself that, before His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> He had mentioned to them that He must suffer these things, and that they were announced beforehand by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>), and when living with them sang praises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as is made evident in the memoirs of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. The words are the following: 'I will declare Your name to my brethren; in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> will I praise You. You that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord, praise Him; all you, the seed of Jacob, glorify Him. Let all the seed of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him.' And when it is said that He changed the name of one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to Peter; and when it is written in the memoirs of Him that this so happened, as well as that He changed the names of other two brothers, the sons of Zebedee, to Boanerges, which means sons of thunder; this was an announcement of the fact that it was He by whom Jacob was called <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Oshea called Jesus (Joshua), under whose name the people who survived of those that came from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were conducted into the land promised to the patriarchs. And that He should arise like a star from the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> showed before hand when he thus said, 'A star shall arise from Jacob, and a leader from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>;' <span class="stiki" id="note012357"><a href="../bible/num024.htm#verse17">Numbers&nbsp;24:17</a></span> and another <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, 'Behold a man; the East is His name.'  Accordingly, when a star rose in heaven at the time of His birth, as is recorded in the memoirs of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> from Arabia, recognising the sign by this, came and worshipped Him.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 107. The same is taught from the history of Jonah</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And that He would rise again on the third day after the crucifixion, it is written  in the memoirs that some of your nation, questioning Him, said, 'Show us a sign;' and He replied to them, 'An <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and no sign shall be given them, save the sign of Jonah.' And since He spoke this obscurely, it was to be understood by the audience that after His crucifixion He should rise again on the third day. And He showed that your generation was more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and more adulterous than the city of Nineveh; for the latter, when Jonah preached to them, after he had been cast up on the third day from the belly of the great fish, that after three (in other versions, forty)  days they should all perish, proclaimed a fast of all creatures, men and beasts, with sackcloth, and with earnest lamentation, with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance from the heart, and turning away from unrighteousness, in the belief that God is merciful and kind to all who turn from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; so that the king of that city himself, with his nobles also, put on sackcloth and remained <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, and obtained their request that the city should not be overthrown. But when Jonah was grieved that on the (fortieth) third day, as he proclaimed, the city was not overthrown, by the dispensation of a gourd  springing up from the earth for him, under which he sat  and was shaded from the heat (now the gourd had sprung up suddenly, and Jonah had neither planted nor watered it, but it had come up all at once to afford him shade), and by the other dispensation of its withering away, for which Jonah grieved, [God] convicted him of being <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> displeased because the city of Nineveh had not been overthrown, and said, 'You have had pity on the gourd, for the which you have not laboured, neither made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night. And shall I not spare Nineveh, the great city, wherein dwell more than six score thousand <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?' </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 108. The resurrection of Christ did not convert the Jews. But through the whole world they have sent men to accuse Christ</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Justin:</strong> And though all the men of your nation <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the incidents in the life of Jonah, and though Christ said among you that He would give the sign of Jonah, exhorting you to repent of your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> at least after He rose again from the dead, and to mourn before God as did the Ninevites, in order that your nation and city might not be taken and destroyed, as they have been destroyed; yet you not only have not repented, after you learned that He rose from the dead, but, as I said before  you have sent chosen and ordained men throughout all the world to proclaim that a godless and lawless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> had sprung from one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, a Galil&aelig;an deceiver, whom we crucified, but his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> stole him by night from the tomb, where he was laid when unfastened from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and now deceive men by asserting that he has risen from the dead and ascended to heaven. Moreover, you accuse Him of having taught those godless, lawless, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> doctrines which you mention to the condemnation of those who confess Him to be Christ, and a Teacher from and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Besides this, even when your city is captured, and your land ravaged, you do not repent, but dare to utter imprecations on Him and all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. Yet we do not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you or those who, by your means, have conceived such prejudices against us; but we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that even now all of you may repent and obtain mercy from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the compassionate and long-suffering Father of all.</p></blockquote>
