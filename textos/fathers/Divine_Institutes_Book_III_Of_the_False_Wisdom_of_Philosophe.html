<h1>Divine Institutes, Book III (Of the False Wisdom of Philosophers)</h1>

<p></p>

<h2>Chapter 1. A Comparison of the Truth with Eloquence: Why the Philosophers Did Not Attain to It. Of the Simple Style of the Scriptures.</h2>

<p>Since it is supposed that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> still lies hidden in obscurity&mdash; either through the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the common people, who are the slaves of various and foolish <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>, or through the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who by the perverseness of their minds confuse rather than throw light upon it&mdash; I could wish that the power of eloquence had fallen to my lot, though not such as it was in Marcus Tullius, for that was extraordinary and admirable, but in some degree approaching it;  that, being supported as much by the strength of talent as it has weight by its own force, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might at length come forth, and having dispelled and refuted public <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of those who are considered wise, might introduce among the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> a brilliant light. And I could wish that this were so, for two reasons: either that men might more readily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when adorned with embellishments, since they even <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, being captivated by the adornment of speech and the enticement of words; or, at all events, that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> themselves might be overpowered by us, most of all by their own arms, in which they are accustomed to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves and to place confidence.</p>

<p>But since God has willed this to be the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the case, that simple and undisguised <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should be more clear, because it has sufficient ornament of itself, and on this account it is corrupted when embellished  with adornings from without, but that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> should please by means of a splendour not its own, because being corrupt of itself it vanishes and melts away, unless it is set off  and polished with decoration sought from another source; I bear it with equanimity that a moderate degree of talent has been granted to me. But it is not in reliance upon eloquence, but upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that I have undertaken this work&mdash;a work, perhaps, too great to be sustained by my strength; which, however, even if I should fail, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself will complete, with the assistance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose office this is. For when I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the greatest orators have often been overcome by pleaders of moderate ability, because the power of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is so great that it defends itself even in small things by its own clearness: why should I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that it will be overwhelmed in a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the greatest importance by men who are ingenious and eloquent, as I admit, but who speak false things; and not that it should appear bright and illustrious, if not by our speech, which is very feeble, and flows from a slight fountain, but by its own light? Nor, if there have been <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> worthy of admiration on account of their literary erudition, should I also yield to them the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and learning of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which no one can attain to by reflection or disputation. Nor do I now disparage the pursuit of those who wished to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because God has made the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man most desirous of arriving at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but I assert and maintain this against them, that the effect did not follow their honest and well-directed will, because they neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in itself, nor how, nor where, nor with what mind it is to be sought. And thus, while they desire to remedy the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they have become entangled in snares and the greatest <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. I have therefore been led to this task of refuting <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> by the very order of the subject which I have undertaken.</p>

<p>For since all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> arises either from false religion or from wisdom,   in refuting <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> it is necessary to overthrow both. For inasmuch as it has been handed down to us in the sacred writings that the thoughts of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are foolish, this very thing is to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by fact and by arguments, that no one, induced by the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> name of wisdom, or deceived by the splendour of empty eloquence, may prefer to give credence to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> rather than to divine things. Which things, indeed, are related in a concise and simple manner. For it was not befitting that, when God was speaking to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He should confirm His words by arguments, as though He would not otherwise  be regarded with confidence: but, as it was right, He spoke as the mighty Judge of all things, to whom it belongs not to argue, but to pronounce sentence. He Himself, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But we, since we have divine testimony for everything, will assuredly show by how much surer arguments <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be defended, when even false things are so defended that they are accustomed to appear <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Wherefore there is no reason why we should give so much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> as to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> their eloquence. For they might speak well as men of learning; but they could not speak <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, because they had not learned the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from Him in whose power it was. Nor, indeed, shall we effect anything great in convicting them of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, which they themselves very often confess. Since they are not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in that one point alone in which alone they ought to have been <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, I will endeavour to show that they never spoke so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> as when they uttered their opinion respecting their own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Of Philosophy, and How Vain Was Its Occupation in Setting Forth the Truth.</h2>

<p>Now, since the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>  has been shown in the two former books, and the origin itself of the whole <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> has been set forth, it is the business of this book to show the emptiness and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> also, that, all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> being removed, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be brought to light and become manifest. Let us begin, therefore, from the common name of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, that when the head itself is destroyed, an easier approach may be open to us for demolishing the whole body; if indeed that can be called a body, the parts and members of which are at variance with one another, and are not united together by any connecting link,  but, as it were, dispersed and scattered, appear to palpitate rather than to live. Philosophy is (as the name indicates, and they themselves define it) the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of wisdom. By what argument, then, can I prove that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is not wisdom, rather than by that derived from the meaning of the name itself? For he who devotes himself to wisdom is manifestly not yet wise, but devotes himself to the subject that he may be wise. In the other arts it appears what this devotedness effects, and to what it tends: for when any one by learning has attained to these, he is now called, not a devoted follower of the profession, but an artificer. But it is said it was on account of modesty that they called themselves devoted to wisdom, and not wise. Nay, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Pythagoras, who first invented this name, since he had a little more wisdom than those of early times, who regarded themselves as wise, understood that it was impossible by any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> study to attain to wisdom, and therefore that a perfect name ought not to be applied to an incomprehensible and imperfect subject. And, therefore, when he was asked what was his profession,  he answered that he was a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, that is, a searcher after wisdom. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> searches after wisdom, it is not wisdom itself, because it must of necessity be one thing which searches, and another which is searched for; nor is the searching itself correct, because it can find nothing.</p>

<p>But I am not prepared to concede even that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are devoted to the pursuit of wisdom, because by that pursuit there is no attaining to wisdom. For if the power of finding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were connected  with this pursuit, and if this pursuit were a kind of road to wisdom, it would at length be found. But since so much time and talent have been wasted in the search for it, and it has not yet been gained, it is plain that there is no wisdom there. Therefore they who apply themselves to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> do not devote themselves to the pursuit of wisdom; but they themselves <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they do so, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not where that is which they are searching for, or of what character it is. Whether, therefore, they devote themselves to the pursuit of wisdom or not, they are not wise, because that can never be discovered which is either sought in an improper manner, or not sought at all. Let us look to this very thing, whether it is possible for anything to be discovered by this kind of pursuit, or nothing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Of What Subjects Philosophy Consists, and Who Was the Chief Founder of the Academic Sect.</h2>

<p>Philosophy appears to consist of two subjects, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and conjecture, and of nothing more. Knowledge cannot come from the understanding, nor be apprehended by thought; because to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in oneself as a peculiar property does not belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of mortals does not receive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, except that which comes from without. For on this account the divine intelligence has opened the eyes and ears and other senses in the body, that by these entrances <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> might flow through to the mind. For to investigate or wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the causes of natural things&mdash;whether the sun is as great as it appears to be, or is many times greater than the whole of this earth; also whether the moon be spherical or concave; and whether the stars are fixed to the heaven, or are borne with free course through the air; of what magnitude the heaven itself is, of what material it is composed; whether it is at rest and immoveable, or is turned round with incredible swiftness; how great is the thickness of the earth, or on what foundations it is poised and suspended,&mdash; to wish to comprehend these things, I say, by disputation and conjectures, is as though we should wish to discuss what we may suppose to be the character of a city in some very remote country, which we have never seen, and of which we have heard nothing more than the name. If we should claim to ourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in a matter of this kind, which cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, should we not appear to be mad, in venturing to affirm that in which we may be refuted? How much more are they to be judged mad and senseless, who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> natural things, which cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by man! Rightly therefore did Socrates, and the Academics  who followed him, take away <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is not the part of a disputant, but of a diviner. It remains that there is in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> conjecture only; for that from which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is absent, is entirely occupied by conjecture. For every one conjectures that of which he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. But they who discuss natural subjects, conjecture that they are as they discuss them. Therefore they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is concerned with that which is certain, conjecture with the uncertain.</p>

<p>Let us return to the example before mentioned. Come, let us conjecture about the state and character of that city which is unknown to us in all respects except in name. It is probable that it is situated on a plain, with walls of stone, lofty buildings, many streets, magnificent and highly adorned temples. Let us describe, if you please, the customs and deportment of the citizens. But when we shall have described these, another will make opposite statements; and when he also shall have concluded, a third will arise, and others after him; and they will make very different conjectures to those of ours. Which therefore of all is more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? Perhaps none of them. But all things have been mentioned which the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the circumstances admits, so that some one of them must necessarily be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But it will not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> who has spoken the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It may possibly be that all have in some degree erred <span style="italic">in their description</span>, and that all have in some degree attained to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore we are foolish if we seek this by disputation; for some one may present himself who may deride our conjectures, and esteem us as mad, since we wish to conjecture the character of that which we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But it is unnecessary to go in quest of remote cases, from which perhaps no one may come to refute us. Come, let us conjecture what is now going on in the forum, what in the senate-house. That also is too distant. Let us say what is taking place with the interposition of a single wall;  no one can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this but he who has heard or seen it. No one therefore ventures to say this, because he will immediately be refuted not by words, but by the presence of the fact itself. But this is the very thing which <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> do, who discuss what is taking place in heaven, but think that they do that with impunity, because there is no one to refute their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. But if they were to think that some one was about to descend who would prove them to be mad and false, they would never discuss those subjects at all which they cannot possibly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Nor, however, is their shamelessness and audacity to be regarded as more successful because they are not refuted; for God refutes them to whom alone the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, although He may seem to connive at their conduct, and He reckons such wisdom of men as the greatest folly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. That Knowledge is Taken Away by Socrates, and Conjecture by Zeno.</h2>

<p>Zeno and the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, then, were right in repudiating conjecture. For to conjecture that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that which you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is not the part of a wise, but rather of a rash and foolish man. Therefore if nothing can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as Socrates taught, or ought to be conjectured, as Zeno taught, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is entirely removed. Why should I say that it is not only overthrown by these two, who were the chiefs of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, but by all, so that it now appears to have been long ago destroyed by its own arms? Philosophy has been divided into many <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>; and they all entertain various sentiments. In which do we place the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? It certainly cannot be in all. Let us point out some one; it follows that all the others will be without wisdom. Let us pass through them separately; in the same manner, whatever we shall give to one we shall take away from the others. For each particular <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> overturns all others, to confirm itself and its own <span style="italic">doctrines</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">:</span> nor does it allow wisdom to any other, lest it should confess that it is itself foolish; but as it takes away others, so is it taken away itself by all others. For they are nevertheless <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who accuse it of folly. Whatever <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> you shall praise and pronounce <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that is censured by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> as false. Shall we therefore <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> one which praises itself and its doctrine, or the many which blame the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of each other? That must of necessity be better which is held by great numbers, than that which is held by one only. For no one can rightly judge concerning himself, as the renowned poet testifies;  for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of men is so arranged, that they see and distinguish the affairs of others better than their own. Since, therefore, all things are uncertain, we must either <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all or none: if we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> no one, then the wise have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, because while they separately affirm different things they think themselves wise; if all, it is equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that there are no wise men, because all deny the wisdom of each individually. Therefore all are in this manner destroyed; and as those fabled <em>sparti</em>  of the poets, so these men mutually slay one another, so that no one remains of all; which happens on this account, because they have a sword, but have no shield. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> individually are convicted of folly by the judgment of many <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, it follows that all are found to be vain and empty; and thus <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> consumes and destroys itself. And since Arcesilas the founder of the Academy understood this, he collected together the mutual censures of all, and the confession of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> made by distinguished <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and armed himself against all. Thus he established a new <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of not <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a>. From this founder, therefore, there began to be two kinds of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>: one the old one, which claims to itself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; the other a new one, opposed to the former, and which detracts from it. Between these two kinds of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> I see that there is disagreement, and as it were civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. On which side shall we place wisdom, which cannot be torn asunder?   If the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, this troop of recruits will perish; if it cannot, the veterans will be destroyed: if they shall be equal, nevertheless <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the guide of all, will still perish, because it is divided; for nothing can be opposed to itself without its own destruction. But if, as I have shown, there can be no inner and peculiar <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in man on account of the frailty of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> condition, the party of Arcesilas prevails. But not even will this stand firm, because it cannot be the case that nothing at all is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. That the Knowledge of Many Things is Necessary.</h2>

<p>For there are many things which nature itself, and frequent use, and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of life, compel us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Accordingly you must perish, unless you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what things are useful for life, in order that you may seek them; and what are dangerous, that you may shun and avoid them. Moreover, there are many things which experience finds out. For the various courses of the sun and moon, and the motions of the stars, and the computation of times, have been discovered, and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of bodies, and the strength of herbs by students of medicine, and by the cultivators of the land the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of soils, and signs of future rains and tempests have been collected. In short, there is no art which is not dependent on <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore Arcesilas ought, if he had any wisdom, to have distinguished the things which were capable of being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and those which were incapable. But if he had done this, he would have reduced himself to the common herd. For the common people have sometimes more wisdom, because they are only so far wise as is necessary. And if you inquire of them whether they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything or nothing, they will say that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and will confess that they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. He was right, therefore, in taking away the systems of others, but he was not right in laying the foundations of his own. For <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of all things cannot be wisdom, the peculiar property of which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And thus, when he overcame the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and taught that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing, he himself also lost the name of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, because his system is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing. For he who blames others because they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, ought himself to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; but when he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing, what perverseness or what insolence it is, to constitute himself a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> on account of that very thing for which he takes away the others! For it is in their power to answer thus: If you convict us of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing, and therefore of being unwise because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing, does it follow that you are not wise, because you confess that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing? What progress, therefore, did Arcesilas make, except that, having dispatched all the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, he pierced himself also with the same sword?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Of Wisdom, and the Academics, and Natural Philosophy.</h2>

<p>Does wisdom therefore nowhere exist? Yes, indeed, it was among them, but no one saw it. Some thought that all things could be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: these were manifestly not wise. Others thought that nothing could be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; nor indeed were these wise: the former, because they attributed too much to man; the latter, because they attributed too little. A limit was wanting to each on either side. Where, then, is wisdom? It consists in thinking neither that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, which is the property of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor that you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of all things, which is the part of a beast. For it is something of a middle character which belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> united and combined with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Knowledge in us is from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which has its origin from heaven; <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> from the body, which is from the earth: whence we have something in common with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with the animal creation. Thus, since we are composed of these two elements, the one of which is endowed with light, the other with darkness, a part of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is given to us, and a part of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Over this bridge, so to speak, we may pass without any danger of falling; for all those who have inclined to either side, either towards the left hand or the right, have fallen. But I will say how each part has erred. The Academics argued from obscure subjects, against the natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, that there was no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and satisfied with the examples of a few incomprehensible subjects, they embraced <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> as though they had taken away the whole of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because they had taken it away in part. But natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, on the other hand, derived their argument from those things which are open, <span style="italic">and inferred</span> that all things could be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and, satisfied with things which were manifest, retained <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; as if they had defended it altogether, because they had defended it in part. And thus neither the one saw what was clear, nor the others what was obscure; but each party, while they contended with the greatest ardour either to retain or to take away <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> only, did not see that there would be placed in the middle that which might guide them to wisdom.</p>

<p>But Arcesilas, who teaches that there is no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,  when he was detracting from Zeno, the chief of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, that he might altogether overthrow <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> on the authority of Socrates, undertook this opinion to affirm that nothing could be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. And thus he disproved the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who had thought that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was drawn forth,  and found out by their talents&mdash;namely, because that wisdom was mortal, and, having been instituted a few ages before, had now attained to its greatest increase, so that it was now necessarily growing old and perishing, the Academy  suddenly arose, the old age, as it were, of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which might dispatch it now withering. And Arcesilas rightly saw that they are arrogant, or rather foolish, who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can be arrived at by conjecture. But no one can refute one speaking <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, unless he who shall have previously <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but Arcesilas, endeavouring to do this without a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, introduced a kind of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which we may call unstable or inconstant.  For, that nothing may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, it is necessary that something be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing at all, the very <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that nothing can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> will be taken away. Therefore he who pronounces as a sentiment that nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, professes, as it were, some conclusion already arrived at and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: therefore it is possible for something to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</p>

<p>Of a similar character to this is that which is accustomed to be proposed in the schools as an example of the kind of fallacy called <em>asystaton</em><span style="italic">;</span> that some one had dreamt that he should not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> dreams. For if he did <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, then it follows that he ought not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them. But if he did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, then it follows that he ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them. Thus, if nothing can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, it is necessary that this fact must be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, that nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But if it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that nothing can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the statement that nothing can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> must as a consequence be false. Thus there is introduced a tenet opposed to itself, and destructive of itself. But the evasive  man wished to take away learning from the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, that he might conceal it at his home. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> he is not for taking it from himself who affirms anything that he may take it from others: but he does not succeed; for it shows itself, and betrays its plunderer. How much more wisely and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> he would act, if he should make an exception, and say that the causes and systems of heavenly things only, or natural things, because they are hidden, cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, for there is no one to teach them; and ought not to be inquired into, for they cannot be found out by inquiry! For if he had brought forward this exception, he would both have admonished the natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> not to search into those things which exceeded the limit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reflection; and would have freed himself from the ill-will arising from <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, and would certainly have left us something to follow. But now, since he has drawn us back from following others, that we may not wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more than we are capable of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, he has no less drawn us back from himself also. For who would wish to labour lest he should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything? Or to undertake learning of this kind that he may even lose ordinary <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? For if this learning exists, it must necessarily consist of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; if it does not exist, who is so foolish as to think that that is worthy of being learned, in which either nothing is learned, or something is even unlearned? Wherefore, if all things cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as the natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> thought, nor nothing, as the Academics taught, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is altogether extinguished.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Of Moral Philosophy, and the Chief Good.</h2>

<p>Let us now pass to the other part of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which they themselves call moral, in which is contained the method of the whole of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, since in natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> there is only delight, in this there is utility also. And since it is more dangerous to commit a fault in arranging the condition of life and in forming the character, greater diligence must be used, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how we ought to live. For in the former subject  some indulgence may be granted: for whether they say anything, they bestow no advantage; or if they foolishly rave, they do no injury. But in this subject there is no room for difference of opinion, none for <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. All must entertain the same sentiments, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself must give instructions as it were with one mouth; because if any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> shall be committed, life is altogether overthrown. In that former part, as there is less danger, so there is more difficulty; because the obscurity of the subject compels us to entertain different and various opinions. But in this, as there is more danger, so there is less difficulty; because the very use of the subjects and daily experiments are able to teach what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> and better. Let us see, therefore, whether they agree, or what <span style="italic">assistance</span> they give us for the better guidance of life. It is not necessary to enlarge on every point; let us select one, and especially that which is the chief and principal thing, in which the whole of wisdom centres and depends.  <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> deems that the chief good consists in pleasure of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, Aristippus in pleasure of the body. Callipho and Dinomachus united <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with pleasure, Diodorus with the privation of pain, Hieronymus placed the chief good in the absence of pain; the Peripatetics, again, in the goods of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the body, and fortune. The chief good of Herillus is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; that of Zeno, to live agreeably to nature; that of certain <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, to follow <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Aristotle placed the chief good in integrity and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. These are the sentiments of nearly all. In such a difference of opinions, whom do we follow? Whom do we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? All are of equal authority. If we are able to select that which is better, it follows that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is not necessary for us; because we are already wise, inasmuch as we judge respecting the opinions of the wise. But since we come for the sake of learning wisdom, how can we judge, who have not yet begun to be wise? Especially when the Academic is close at hand, to draw us back by the cloak, and forbid us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> any one, without bringing forward that which we may follow.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Of the Chief Good, and the Pleasures of the Soul and Body, and of Virtue.</h2>

<p>What then remains, but that we leave raving and obstinate wranglers, and come to the judge, who is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the giver of simple and calm wisdom? Which is able not only to mould us, and lead us into the way, but also to pass an opinion on the controversies of those men. This teaches us what is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and highest good of man; but before I begin to speak on this subject, all those opinions must be refuted, that it may appear that no one of those <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a></span> was wise. Since the inquiry is respecting the duty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the chief good of the chief animal ought to be placed in that which it cannot have in common with the other animals. But as teeth are the peculiar property of wild beasts, horns of cattle, and wings of birds, so something peculiar to himself ought to be attributed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, without which he would lose the fixed  order of his condition. For that which is given to all for the purpose of life or generation, is indeed a natural good; but still it is not the greatest, unless it be peculiar to each class. Therefore he was not a wise man who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that pleasure of the mind is the chief good, since that, whether it be freedom from anxiety or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, is common to all. I do not consider Aristippus even worthy of an answer; for since he is always rushing into pleasures of the body, and is only the slave of sensual indulgences, no one can regard him as a man: for he lived in such a manner that there was no difference between him and a brute, except this only, that he had the faculty of speech. But if the power of speaking were given to the ass, or the dog, or swine, and you were to inquire from these why they so furiously pursue the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, that they can scarcely be separated from them, and even neglect their food and I drink; why they either drive away other males, or do not abstain from the pursuit even when vanquished, but often, when bruised by stronger animals, they are more determined in their pursuit; why they dread neither rain nor cold; why they undertake labour, and do not shrink from danger&mdash;what other answer will they give, but that the chief good is bodily pleasure?&mdash; that they eagerly seek it, in order that they may be affected with the most agreeable sensations; and that these are of so much importance, that, for the sake of attaining them, they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that no labour, nor wounds, nor death itself, ought to be refused by them? Shall we then seek precepts of living from these men, who have no other feelings than those of the irrational creatures?</p>

<p>The Cyrenaics say that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself is to be praised on this account, because it is productive of pleasure. True, says the filthy dog, or the swine wallowing in the mire.  For it is on this account that I contend with my adversary with the utmost exertion of strength, that my valour may procure for me pleasure; of which I must necessarily be deprived if I shall come off vanquished. Shall we therefore learn wisdom from these men, who differ from cattle and the brutes, not in feeling, but in language? To regard the absence of pain as the chief good, is not indeed the part of Peripatetic and Stoic, but of clinical <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. For who would not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the discussion was carried on by those who were ill, and under the influence of some pain? What is so ridiculous, as to esteem that the chief good which the physician is able to give? We must therefore feel pain in order that we may enjoy good; and that, too, severely and frequently, that afterwards the absence of pain may be attended with greater pleasure. He is therefore most wretched who has never felt pain, because he is without that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; whereas we used to regard him as most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, because he was without <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. He was not far distant from this folly, who said that the entire absence of pain was the chief good. For, besides the fact that every animal avoids pain, who can bestow upon himself that good, towards the obtaining of which we can do no more than wish? But the chief good cannot make any one <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, unless it shall be always in his power; and it is not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, nor learning, nor labour, which affords this to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but nature herself bestows it upon all living creatures. They who joined pleasure with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> principle, wished to avoid this common blending together of all, but they made a contradictory kind of good; since he who is abandoned to pleasure must of necessity be destitute of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> principle, and he who aims at principle must be destitute of pleasure.</p>

<p>The <span style="italic">chief</span> good of the Peripatetics may possibly appear excessive, various, and&mdash; excepting those goods which belong to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and what they are is a great subject of dispute&mdash; common to man with the beasts. For goods belonging to the body&mdash; that is, safety, freedom from pain, health&mdash; are no less necessary for dumb creatures than for man; and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not if they are not more necessary for them, because man can be relieved by remedies and services, the dumb animals cannot. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of those which they call the goods of fortune; for as man has need of resources for the support of life, so have they  need of prey and pasture. Thus, by introducing a good which is not within the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, they made man altogether subject to the power of another. Let us also hear Zeno, for he at times dreams of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The chief good, he says, is to live in accordance with nature. Therefore we must live after the manner of the brutes. For in these are found all the things which ought to be absent from man: they are eager for pleasures, they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, they deceive, they lie in wait, they kill; and that which is especially to the point, they have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Why, therefore, does he teach me to live according to nature, which is of itself prone to a worse course, and under the influence of some more soothing blandishments plunges headlong into <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>? Or if he says that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of brutes is different from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because man is born to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, he says something to the purpose; but, however, it will not be a definition of the chief good, because there is no animal which does not live in accordance with its nature.</p>

<p>He who made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the chief good, gave something peculiar to man; but men desire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> for the sake of something else, and not for its own sake. For who is contented with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, without seeking some advantage from his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? The arts are learned for the purpose of being put into exercise; but they are exercised either for the support of life, or pleasure, or for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. That, therefore, is not the chief good which is not sought for on its own account. What difference, therefore, does it make, whether we consider <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to be the chief good, or those very things which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> produces from itself, that is, means of subsistence, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, pleasure? And these things are not peculiar to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and therefore they are not the chief goods; for the desire of pleasure and of food does not exist in man alone, but also in the brutes. How is it with regard to the desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? Is it not discovered in horses, since they exult in victory, and are grieved when vanquished? <q>So great is their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of praises, so great is their eagerness for victory.</q>  Nor without reason does that most excellent poet say that we must try <q>what grief they feel when overcome, and how they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in victory.</q> But if those things which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> produces are common to man with other animals, it follows that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not the chief good. Moreover, it is no slight fault of this definition that bare <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is set forth. For all will begin to appear <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who shall have the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of any art, even those who shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> mischievous subjects; so that he who shall have learned to mix poisons, is as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> as he who has learned to apply remedies. I ask, therefore, to what subject <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is to be referred. If to the causes of natural things, what <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> will be proposed to me, if I shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the sources of the Nile, or the vain dreams of the natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> respecting the heaven? Why should I mention that on these subjects there is no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but mere conjecture, which varies according to the abilities of men? It only remains that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things is the chief good. Why, then, did he call <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the chief good more than wisdom, when both words have the same signification and meaning? But no one has yet said that the chief good is wisdom, though this might more properly have been said. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is insufficient for the undertaking of that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and avoiding that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, unless <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> also is added. For many of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, though they discussed the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, yet from the compulsion of nature lived in a manner different from their discourse, because they were without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> united with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is wisdom.</p>

<p>It remains that we refute those also who judged <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself to be the chief good, and Marcus Tullius was also of this opinion; and in this they were very inconsiderate.  For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself is not the chief good, but it is the contriver and mother of the chief good; for this cannot be attained without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Each point is easily understood. For I ask whether they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that it is easy to arrive at that distinguished good, or that it is reached only with difficulty and labour? Let them apply their ingenuity, and defend <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. If it is easily attained to, and without labour, it cannot be the chief good. For why should we torment ourselves, why wear ourselves out with striving day and night, seeing that the object of our pursuit is so close at hand, that any one who wishes may grasp it without any effort of the mind? But if we do not attain even to a common and moderate good except by labour, since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are by their nature arduous and difficult,  whereas <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things have a downward tendency, it follows that the greatest labour is necessary for the attainment of the greatest good. And if this is most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then there is need of another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that we may arrive at that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is called the chief good; but this is incongruous and absurd, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should arrive at itself by means of itself. If no good can be reached unless by labour, it is evident that it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by which it is reached, since the force and office of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consist in the undertaking and carrying through of labours. Therefore the chief good cannot be that by which it is necessary to arrive at another. But they, since they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the effects and tendency of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and could discover nothing more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, stopped at the very name of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and said that it ought to be sought, though no advantage was proposed from it; and thus they fixed for themselves a good which itself stood in need of a good. From these Aristotle was not far removed, who thought that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> together with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> was the chief good; as though it were possible for any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to exist unless it were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, and as though it would not cease to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> if it had any measure of disgrace. But he saw that it might happen that a bad opinion is entertained respecting <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by a depraved judgment, and therefore he thought that deference should be paid to what in the estimation of men constitutes a departure from what is right and good, because it is not in our power that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should be honoured simply for its own deserts. For what is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>  character, except perpetual <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, conferred on any one by the favourable report of the people? What, then, will happen, if through the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and perverseness of men a bad <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> should ensue? Shall we cast aside <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> because it is judged to be base and disgraceful by the foolish? And since it is capable of being oppressed and harassed, in order that it may be of itself a peculiar and lasting good, it ought to stand in need of no outward assistance, so as not to depend by itself upon its own strength, and to remain steadfast. And thus no good is to be hoped by it from man, nor is any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be refused.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Of the Chief Good, and the Worship of the True God, and a Refutation of Anaxagoras.</h2>

<p>I now come to the chief good of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which is to be determined in this manner: first, it must be the property of man alone, and not belong to any other animal; secondly, it must belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> only, and not be shared with the body; lastly, it cannot fall to the lot of any one without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now this limitation excludes and does away with all the opinions of those <span style="italic">whom I have mentioned</span> <span style="italic">;</span> for their sayings contain nothing of this kind. I will now say what this is, that I may show, as I designed, that all <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were blind and foolish, who could neither see, nor understand, nor surmise at any time what was fixed as the chief good for man. Anaxagoras, when asked for what purpose he was born, replied that he might look upon the heaven and the sun. This expression is admired by all, and judged worthy of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. But I think that he, being unprepared with an answer, uttered this at random, that he might  not be silent. But if he had been wise, he ought to have considered and reflected with himself; for if any one is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his own condition, he cannot even he a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But let us <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the saying was not uttered on the spur of the moment. Let us see how many and what great <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> he committed in three words. First, he erred in placing the whole duty of man in the eyes alone, referring nothing to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but everything to the body. But if he had been blind, would he lose the duty of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which cannot happen without the ruin  of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? What of the other parts of the body? Will they be destitute, each of its own duty? Why should I say that more depends upon the ears than upon the eye, since learning and wisdom can be gained by the ears only, but not by the eyes only? Were you born for the sake of seeing the heaven and the sun? Who introduced you to this  sight? Or what does your vision contribute to the heaven and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things? Doubtless that you may praise this immense and wonderful work. Therefore confess that God is the Creator of all things, who introduced you into this world, as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and praiser of His great work. You <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it is a great thing to behold the heaven and the sun: why, therefore, do you not give thanks to Him who is the author of this benefit? Why do you not measure with your mind the excellence, the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and the power of Him whose works you admire? For it must be, that He who created objects worthy of admiration, is Himself much more to be admired. If any one had invited you to dinner, and you had been well entertained, should you appear in your senses, if you esteemed the mere pleasure more highly than the author of the pleasure? So entirely do <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> refer all things to the body, and nothing at all to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, nor do they see beyond that which fails under their eyes. But all the offices of the body being put aside, the business of man is to be placed in the mind alone. Therefore we are not born for this purpose, that we may see those things which are created, but that we may contemplate, that is, behold with our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the Creator of all things Himself. Wherefore, if any one should ask a man who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> wise for what purpose he was born, he will answer without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or hesitation, that he was born for the purpose of worshipping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who brought us into being for his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, that we may serve Him. But to serve God is nothing else than to maintain and preserve <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by good works. But he, as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of divine things, reduced a matter of the greatest magnitude to the least, by selecting two things only, which he said were to be beheld by him. But if he had said that he was born to behold the world, although he would comprise all things in this, and would use an expression of greater  sound, yet he would not have completed the duty of man; for as much as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> excels the body, so much does God excel the world, for God made and governs the world. Therefore it is not the world which is to be contemplated by the eye, for each is a body;  but it is God who is to be contemplated by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being Himself <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, willed that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also should be everlasting. But the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of God is the reverence and worship of the common Parent of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. And if the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were destitute of this, and in their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of divine things prostrated themselves to the earth, we must suppose that Anaxagoras neither beheld the heaven nor the sun, though he said that he was born that he might behold them. The object proposed to man is therefore plain  and easy, if he is wise; and to it especially belongs humanity.  For what is humanity itself, but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>? What is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>? And <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>  is nothing else than the recognition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as a parent.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. It is the Peculiar Property of Man to Know and Worship God.</h2>

<p>Therefore the chief good of man is in religion only; for the other things, even those which are supposed to be peculiar to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, are found in the other animals also. For when they discern and distinguish their own voices  by peculiar marks among themselves, they seem to converse: they also appear to have a kind of smile, when with soothed ears, and contracted mouth, and with eyes relaxed to sportiveness, they fawn upon man, or upon their own mates and young. Do they not give a greeting which bears some resemblance to mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and indulgence? Again, those creatures which look forward to the future and lay up for themselves food, plainly have foresight. Indications of reason are also found in many of them. For since they desire things useful to themselves, guard against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, avoid dangers, prepare for themselves lurking-places standing open in different places with various outlets, assuredly they have some understanding. Can any one deny that they are possessed of reason, since they often deceive man himself? For those which have the office of producing honey, when they inhabit the place assigned to them, fortify a camp, construct dwellings with unspeakable skill, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> their king; I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not if there is not in them perfect <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. It is therefore uncertain whether those things which are given to man are common to him with other living creatures: they are certainly without religion. I indeed thus judge, that reason is given to all animals, but to the dumb creatures only for the protection of life, to man also for its prolongation. And because reason itself is perfect in man, it is named wisdom, which renders man distinguished in this respect, that to him alone it is given to comprehend divine things. And concerning this the opinion of Cicero is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: <q>Of so many kinds of animals,</q> he says, <q>there is none except man which has any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> themselves, there is no nation either so uncivilized or so savage, which, even if it is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of due conceptions of the Deity, does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that some conception of Him ought to be entertained.</q> From which it is effected, that he acknowledges <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, as it were, calls to mind the source from which he is sprung. Those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, therefore, who wish to free the mind from all <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, take away even religion, and thus deprive man of his peculiar and surpassing good, which is distinct from living uprightly, and from everything connected with man, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made all living creatures subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, also made man subject to Himself. What reason is there why they should also maintain that the mind is to be turned in the same direction to which the countenance is raised? For if we must look to the heaven, it is undoubtedly for no other reason than on account of religion; if religion is taken away, we have nothing to do with the heaven. Therefore we must either look in that direction or bend down to the earth. We are not able to bend down to the earth, even if we should wish, since our posture is upright. We must therefore look up to the heaven, to which the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body calls us. And if it is admitted that this must be done, it must either be done with this view, that we may devote ourselves to religion, or that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the heavenly objects. But we cannot by any means <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the heavenly objects, because nothing of that kind can be found out by reflection, as I have before shown. We must therefore devote ourselves to religion, and he who does not undertake this prostrates himself to the ground, and, imitating the life of the brutes, abdicates the office of man. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> are more wise; for although they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in choosing religion, yet they remember their own nature and condition.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Of Religion, Wisdom, and the Chief Good.</h2>

<p>It is agreed upon, therefore, by the general consent of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, that religion ought to be undertaken; but we have to explain what <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> are committed on this subject. God willed this to be the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that he should be desirous and eager for two things, religion and wisdom. But men are mistaken in this, that they either undertake religion and pay no attention to wisdom, or they devote themselves to wisdom alone, and pay no attention to religion, though the one cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> without the other. The consequence is, that they fall into a multiplicity of <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a>, but false ones, because they have left wisdom, which could have taught them that there cannot be many gods; or they devote themselves to wisdom, but a false wisdom, because they have paid no attention to the religion of the Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who might have instructed them to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Thus men who undertake either of these courses follow a devious path, and one full of the greatest <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, inasmuch as the duty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, are included in these two things which are inseparably connected. I wonder, therefore, that there was none at all of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who discovered the abode and dwelling-place of the chief good. For they might have sought it in this manner. Whatever the greatest good is, it must be an object proposed to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. There is pleasure, which is desired by all; but this is common also to man with the beasts, and has not the force of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, and brings a feeling of satiety, and when it is in excess is injurious, and it is lessened by advance of age, and does not fall to the lot of many: for they who are without resources, who constitute the greater part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, must also be without pleasure. Therefore pleasure is not the chief good; but it is not even a good. What shall we say of riches? This is much more  <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of them. For they fall to the lot of fewer men, and that generally by chance; and they often fall to the indolent, and sometimes by guilt, and they are desired by those who already possess them. What shall we say of sovereignty itself? That does not constitute the chief good: for all cannot reign, but it is necessary that all should be capable of attaining the chief good.</p>

<p>Let us therefore seek something which is held forth to all. Is it <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>? It cannot be denied that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a good, and undoubtedly a good for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But if it cannot be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> because its power and nature consist in the endurance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it assuredly is not the chief good. Let us seek something else. But nothing can be found more beautiful than <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, nothing more worthy of a wise man. For if <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are to be avoided on account of their deformity, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is therefore to be desired on account of its beauty. What then? Can it be that that which is admitted to be good and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> should be requited with no reward, and be so unproductive as to procure no advantage from itself? That great labour and difficulty and struggling against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> with which this life is filled, must of necessity produce some great good. But what shall we say that it is? Pleasure? But nothing that is base can arise from that which is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>. Shall we say that it is riches? Or commands? But these things are frail and uncertain.  Is it <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? Or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>? Or a lasting name? But all these things are not contained in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself, but depend upon the opinion and judgment of others. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is often <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and visited with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But the good which arises from it ought to be so closely united with it as to be incapable of being separated or disunited from it; and it cannot appear to be the chief good in any other way than if it belongs peculiarly to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and is such that nothing can be added to it or taken from it. Why should I say that the duties of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consist in the despising of all these things? For not to long for, or desire, or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> pleasures, riches, dominions, and honours, and all those things which are esteemed as goods, as others do overpowered by desire, that assuredly is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it effects something else more sublime and excellent; nor does anything struggle against these present goods but that which longs for greater and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> things. Let us not despair of being able to find it, if we turn our thoughts in all directions; for no slight or trifling rewards are sought.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Of the Twofold Conflict of Body and Soul; And of Desiring Virtue on Account of Eternal Life.</h2>

<p>But our inquiry is as to the object for which we are born: and thus we are able to trace out what is the effect of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. There are two  parts of which man is made up, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. There are many things peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, many peculiar to the body, many common to both, as is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself; and as often as this is referred to the body, it is called <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> for the sake of distinction. Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is connected with each, a contest is proposed to each, and victory held forth to each from the contest: the body, because it is solid, and capable of being grasped, must contend with objects which are solid and can be grasped; but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, on the other hand, because it is slight  and subtle, and invisible, contends with those enemies who cannot be seen and touched. But what are the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? And if <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> shall have overcome and put to flight these, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be pure and free from stain. Whence, then, are we able to collect what are the effects of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Doubtless from that which is closely connected with it, and resembles it, that is, from <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of the body; for when this has come to any encounter and contest, what else does it seek from victory but life? For whether you contend with a man or beast, the contest is for safety. Therefore, as the body obtains by victory its preservation from destruction, so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> obtains a continuation of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and as the body, when overcome by its enemies, suffers death, so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when overpowered by <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, must die. What difference, therefore, will there be between the contest carried on by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and that carried on by the body, except that the body seeks for temporal, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life? If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> by itself, since its whole force consists, as I have said, in the enduring of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; if it neglects all things which are desired as goods; if in its highest condition it is exposed to death, inasmuch as it often refuses life, which is desired by others, and bravely undergoes death, which others <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; if it must necessarily produce some great good from itself, because labours, endured and overcome even until death, cannot fail of obtaining a reward; if no reward, such as it deserves, is found on earth, inasmuch as it despises all things which are frail and transitory, what else remains but that it may effect some heavenly reward, since it treats with contempt all earthly things, and may aim at higher things, since it despises things that are <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>? And this <span style="italic">reward</span> can be nothing else but <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</p>

<p>With good reason, therefore, did Euclid, no obscure <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, who was the founder of the system of the Megareans, differing from the others, say that that was the chief good which was unvarying and always the same. He certainly understood what is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the chief good, although he did not explain in what it consisted; but it consists of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, nor anything else at all, inasmuch as it alone is incapable of diminution, or increase, or change. Seneca also unconsciously happened to confess that there is no other reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. For in praising <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the treatise which he wrote on the subject of premature death, he says: <q>Virtue is the only thing which can confer upon us <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and make us equal to the gods.</q> But the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> also, whom he followed, say that no one can be made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore, the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life, if <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as it is rightly said, makes a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life. Virtue, therefore, is not, as they say, to be sought on its own account, but on account of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life, which necessarily follows <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And this argument might have taught them in what the chief good consisted. But this present and corporeal life cannot be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, because it is subjected to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> through the body. <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> calls God <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and incorruptible, because He is everlasting. For a state of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> ought to be perfect, so that there may be nothing which can harass, or lessen, or change it. Nor can anything be judged <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in other respects, unless it be incorruptible. But nothing is incorruptible but that which is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. Immortality therefore is alone <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, because it can neither be corrupted nor destroyed. But if <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> falls within the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which no one can deny, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> also belongs to him. For it is impossible for a man to be wretched who is endued with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. If <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> falls within his power, then <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, which is possessed of the attribute of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, also belongs to him.</p>

<p>The chief good, therefore, is found to be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> alone, which pertains to no other animal or body; nor can it happen to any one without the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that is, without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. And how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and right is the seeking for this, the very desire of this life shows: for although it be but temporary, and most full of labour, yet it is sought and desired by all; for both old men and boys, kings and those of the lowest station, in fine, wise as well as foolish, desire this. Of such value, as it seemed to Anaxagoras, is the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the heaven and the light itself, that men willingly undergo any miseries on this account. Since, therefore, this short and laborious life, by the general consent not only of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but also of other animals, is considered a great good, it is manifest that it becomes also a very great and perfect good if it is without an end and free from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In short, there never would have been any one who would despise this life, however short it is, or undergo death, unless through the hope of a longer life. For those who voluntarily offered themselves to death for the safety of their countrymen, as Men&oelig;ceus did at Thebes, Codrus at Athens, Curtius and the two Mures at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, would never have preferred death to the advantages of life, unless they had thought that they should attain to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> through the estimation of their countrymen; and although they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the life of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, yet the reality itself did not escape their notice. For if <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> despises opulence and riches because they are frail, and pleasures because they are of brief continuance, it therefore despises a life which is frail and brief, that it may obtain one which is substantial and lasting. Therefore reflection itself, advancing by regular order, and weighing everything, leads us to that excellent and surpassing good, on account of which we are born. And if <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> had thus acted, if they had not preferred obstinately to maintain that which they had once apprehended, they would undoubtedly have arrived at this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as I have lately shown. And if this was not the part of those who extinguish the heavenly <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> together with the body, yet those who discuss the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ought to have understood that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is set before us on this account, that, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> having been subdued, and the desire of earthly things overcome, our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, pure and victorious, may return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, to their original source. For it is on this account that we alone of living creatures are raised to the sight of the heaven, that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that our chief good is in the highest place. Therefore we alone receive religion, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from this source that the spirit of man is not mortal, since it longs for and acknowledges <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, of all the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, those who have embraced either <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as the chief good, have kept the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but have not arrived at perfection. For these are the two things which together make up that which is sought for. Knowledge causes us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by what means and to what end we must attain; <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> causes us to attain to it. The one without the other is of no avail; for from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> arises <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> the chief good is produced. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life, which <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have always sought, and still do seek, has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> either in the worship of the gods or in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; and on this account they were unable to find it, because they did not seek the highest good in the highest place, but in the lowest. For what is the highest but heaven, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from whom the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has its origin? And what is the lowest but the earth, from which the body is made? Therefore, although some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have assigned the chief good, not to the body, but to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, yet, inasmuch as they have referred it to this life, which has its ending with the body, they have gone back to the body, to which the whole of this time which is passed on earth has reference. Therefore it was not without reason that they did not attain to the highest good; for whatever looks to the body only, and is without <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, must necessarily be the lowest. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not fall to the condition of man in that manner in which <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> thought; but it so falls to him, not that he should then be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, when he lives in the body, which must undoubtedly be corrupted in order to its dissolution; but then, when, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being freed from intercourse with the body, he lives in the spirit only. In this one thing alone can we be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in this life, if we appear to be unhappy; if, avoiding the enticements of pleasures, and giving ourselves to the service of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> only, we live in all labours and miseries, which are the means of exercising and strengthening <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; if, in short, we keep to that rugged and difficult path which has been opened for us to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. The chief good therefore which makes men <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> cannot exist, unless it be in that religion and doctrine to which is annexed the hope of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Of the Immortality of the Soul, and of Wisdom, Philosophy, and Eloquence.</h2>

<p>The subject seems to require in this place, that since we have taught that <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> is the chief good, we should prove this also, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. On which subject there is great disputation among <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; nor have they who held <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinions respecting the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> been able to explain or prove anything: for, being destitute of divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, they neither brought forward <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> arguments by which they might overcome, nor evidence by which they might convince. But we shall treat of this question more conveniently in the last book, when we shall have to discuss the subject of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life. There remains that third part of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which they call Logic, in which the whole subject of dialectics and the whole method of speaking are contained. Divine learning does not stand in need of this, because the seat of wisdom is not the tongue, but the heart; and it makes no difference what kind of language you employ, for the question is not about words,  but facts. And we are not disputing about the grammarian or the orator, whose <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is concerned with the proper manner of speaking, but about the wise man, whose learning is concerned with the right manner of living. But if that system of natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> before mentioned is not necessary, nor this of logic, because they are not able to render a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, it remains that the whole force of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is contained in the ethical part alone, to which Socrates is said to have applied himself, laying aside the others. And since I have shown that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> erred in this part also, who did not grasp the chief good, for the sake of gaining which we are born; it appears that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is altogether false and empty, since it does not prepare us for the duties of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, nor strengthen the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> and settled course of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life. Let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, therefore, that they are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is wisdom; let them not be drawn away by the authority of any one; but rather let them incline to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and approach it. There is no room for rashness here; we must endure the punishment of our folly to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, if we shall be deceived either by an empty character or a false opinion. But man,  such as he is, if he trusts in himself, that is, if he trusts in man, is (not to say foolish, in that he does not see his own <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>) undoubtedly arrogant, in venturing to claim for himself that which the condition of man does not admit of.</p>

<p>And how much that greatest author of the Roman language is deceived, we may see from that sentiment of his; for when, in his <q>Books on Offices,</q>  he had said that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is nothing else than the desire of wisdom, and that wisdom itself is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, added: <q>And if any one censures the desire of this, I do not indeed understand what there is which he imagines praiseworthy. For if enjoyment of the mind and rest from cares is sought, what enjoyment can be compared with the pursuits of those who are always inquiring into something which has reference to and tends to promote a good and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life? Or if any account is taken of consistency and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, either this is the study  by which we may attain them, or there is none at all. To say that there is no system in connection with the greatest subjects, when none of the least is without a system, is the part of men speaking inconsiderately, and erring in the greatest subjects. But if there is any discipline of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, where shall it be sought when you have departed from that kind of learning?</q> For my own part, although I endeavoured to attain in some degree to the means of acquiring learning, on account of my desire to teach others, yet I have never been eloquent, inasmuch as I never even engaged in public speaking; but the goodness of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> cannot fail of itself to make me eloquent, and for its clear and copious defence the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divinity and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself are sufficient. I could wish, therefore, that Cicero might for a short time rise from the dead, that a man of such consummate eloquence might be taught by an insignificant person who is devoid of eloquence, first, what that is which is deemed worthy of praise by him who blames that study which is called <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; and in the next place, that it is not that study by which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are learned, nor any other, as he thought; and lastly, that since there is a discipline of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, he might be taught where it is to be sought, when you have laid aside that kind of learning, which he did not seek for the sake of hearing and learning. For from whom could he hear when no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it? But, as his usual practice was in pleading causes, he wished to press <span style="italic">his opponent</span> by questioning, and thus to lead him to confession, as though he were confident that no answer could be given to show that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was not the instructress of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And in the Tusculan disputations he openly professed this, turning his speech to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, as though he was showing himself off by a declamatory style of speaking. <q>O <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, you guide of life,</q> he says; <q>O you investigator of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and expeller of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>; what could not only we, but the life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, have effected at all without you? You have been the inventor of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, you the teacher of morals and discipline;</q>&mdash; as though, indeed, she could perceive anything by herself, and he were not rather to be praised who gave her. In the same manner he might have given thanks to food and drink, because without these life could not exist; yet these, while they minister to sense, confer no benefit. But as these things are the nourishment of the body, so wisdom is of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. That Lucretius and Others Have Erred, and Cicero Himself, in Fixing the Origin of Wisdom.</h2>

<p>Lucretius, accordingly, acts more correctly in praising him who was the first discoverer of wisdom; but he acts foolishly in this, that he supposed it to be discovered by a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>&mdash;as though that man whom he praises had found it lying somewhere as flutes at the fountain,  according to the legends of the poets. But if he praised the inventor of wisdom as a god&mdash;for thus he speaks: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>No one, I think, who is formed of mortal body. For if we must speak, as the acknowledged majesty of the subject itself demands, he was a god, he was a god, most noble Memmius,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote><p>yet God ought not to have been praised on this account, because He discovered wisdom, but because He created man, who might be capable of receiving wisdom. For he diminishes the praise who praises a part only of the whole. But he praised Him as a man; whereas He ought to have been esteemed as a God on this very account, because He found out wisdom. For thus he speaks: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Will it not be right that this man should be enrolled among the gods?</q></p></blockquote><p>From this it appears, either that he wished to praise Pythagoras, who was the first, as I have said,  to call himself a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>; or Thales of Miletus, who is reported to have been the first who discussed the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things. Thus, while he seeks to exalt, he has depressed the thing itself. For it is not great if it could have been discovered by man. But he may be pardoned as a poet. But that same accomplished orator, that same consummate <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, also censures the Greeks, whose levity he always accuses, and yet imitates. Wisdom itself, which at one time he calls the gift, at another time the invention, of the gods, he fashions after the manner of the poets, and praises on account of its beauty. He also grievously complains that there have been some who disparaged it. <q>Can any one,</q> he says, <q>dare to censure the parent of life, and to defile himself with this guilt of parricide, and to be so impiously ungrateful?</q></p>

<p>Are we then parricides, Marcus Tullius, and in your judgment worthy to be sewed  up in a bag, who deny that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is the parent of life? Or you, who are so impiously ungrateful towards God (not this god whose image you worship as he sits in the Capitol, but Him who made the world and created man, who bestowed wisdom also among His heavenly benefits), do you call her the teacher of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or the parent of life, having learned  from whom, one must be in much greater uncertainty than he was before? For of what <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is she the teacher? For <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> to the present time do not explain where she is situated. Of what life is she the parent? Since the teachers themselves have been worn out by old age and death before they have determined upon the befitting course of life. Of what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can you hold her forth as an explorer? Since you often testify that, in so great a multitude of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, not a single wise man has yet <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. What, then, did that mistress of life teach you? Was it to assail with reproaches the most powerful consul,  and by your envenomed speeches to render him the enemy of his country? But let us pass by those things, which may be excused under the name of fortune. You applied yourself, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and so, indeed, that no one ever applied himself more diligently; since you were acquainted with all the systems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, as you yourself are accustomed to boast, and elucidated the subject itself in Latin writings, and displayed yourself as an imitator of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. Tell us, therefore, what you have learned, or in what <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> you have discovered the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Doubtless it was in the Academy which you followed and approved. But this teaches nothing, excepting that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.  Therefore your own books refute you, and show the nothingness of the learning which may be gained from <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> for life. These are your words: <q>But to me we appear not only blind to wisdom, but dull and obtuse to those very things which may appear in some degree to be discerned.</q> If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is the teacher of life, why did you appear to yourself blind, and dull, and obtuse? Whereas you ought, under her teaching, both to perceive and to be wise, and to be engaged in the clearest light. But how you confessed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> we learn from the letters addressed to your son, in which you advise him that the precepts of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but that we must live as members of a community. </p>

<p>What can be spoken so contradictory? If the precepts of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, it is on this account that they ought to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, in order to our living well and wisely. Or if we must live as members of a community, then <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is not wisdom, if it is better to live in accordance with society than with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. For if that which is called <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> be wisdom, he assuredly lives foolishly who does not live according to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. But if he does not live foolishly who lives in accordance with society, it follows that he who lives according to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> lives foolishly. By your own judgment, therefore, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is condemned of folly and emptiness. And you also, in your <span style="italic">Consolation</span>, that is, not in a work of levity and mirth, introduced this sentiment respecting <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>: <q>But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> possesses us, or deplorable <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> Where, then, is the guidance of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>? Or what has that parent of life taught you, if you are deplorably <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? But if this confession of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> has been extorted almost against your will from your innermost breast, why do you not at length acknowledge to yourself the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which, though it teaches nothing, you extolled with praises to the heavens, cannot be the teacher of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. The Error of Seneca in Philosophy, and How the Speech of Philosophers is at Variance with Their Life.</h2>

<p>Under the influence of the same <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> (for who could keep the right course when Cicero is in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>?), Seneca said: <q>Philosophy is nothing else than the right method of living, or the science of living honourably, or the art of passing a good life. We shall not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in saying that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is the law of living well and honourably. And he who spoke of it as a rule of life, gave to it that which was its due.</q> He evidently did not refer to the common name of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; for, since this is diffused into many <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and systems, and has nothing certain&mdash; nothing, in short, respecting which all agree with one mind and one voice&mdash;what can be so false as that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> should be called the rule of life, since the diversity of its precepts hinders the right way and causes confusion? Or the law of living well, when its subjects are widely discordant? Or the science of passing life, in which nothing else is effected by its repeated contradictions than general  uncertainty? For I ask whether he thinks that the Academy is <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> or not? I do not think that he will deny it. And if this is so, none of these things, therefore, is in agreement with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; which renders all things uncertain, abrogates law, esteems art as nothing, subverts method, distorts rule, entirely takes away <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore all those things are false, because they are inconsistent with a system which is always uncertain, and up to this time explaining nothing. Therefore no system, or science, or law of living well, has been established, except in this the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and heavenly wisdom, which had been unknown to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. For that earthly wisdom, since it is false, becomes varied and manifold, and altogether opposed to itself. And as there is but one founder and ruler of the world, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is one; so wisdom must be one and simple, because, if anything is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and good, it cannot be perfect unless it is the only one of its kind. But if <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> were able to form the life, no others but <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> would be good, and all those who had not learned it would be always bad. But since there are, and always have been, innumerable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are or have been good without any learning, but of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> there has seldom been one who has done anything praiseworthy in his life; who is there, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, who does not see that those men are not teachers of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, of which they themselves are destitute? For if any one should diligently inquire into their character, he will find that they are passionate, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, lustful, arrogant, wanton, and, concealing their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> under a show of wisdom, doing those things at home which they had censured in the schools. </p>

<p>Perhaps I speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> for the sake of bringing an accusation. Does not Tullius both acknowledge and complain of the same thing? <q>How few,</q> he says, <q>of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are found of such a character, so constituted in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and life, as reason demands! How few who think <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> instruction not a display of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but a law of life! How few who are <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to themselves, and submit to their own decrees! We may see some of such levity and ostentation, that it would be better for them not to have learned at all; others eagerly desirous of money, others of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; many the slaves of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, so that their speech wonderfully disagrees with their life.</q> Cornelius Nepos also writes to the same Cicero: <q>So far am I from thinking that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is the teacher of life and the completer of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, that I consider that none have greater need of teachers of living than many who are engaged in the discussion of this subject. For I see that a great part of those who give most elaborate precepts in their school respect-modesty and self-restraint, live at the same time in the unrestrained desires of all <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.</q> Seneca also, in his <span style="italic">Exhortations</span>, says: <q>Many of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are of this description, eloquent to their own condemnation: for if you should hear them arguing against <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, against <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and ambition, you would think that they were making a public disclosure  of their own character, so entirely do the censures which they utter in public flow back upon themselves; so that it is right to regard them in no other light than as physicians, whose advertisements  contain medicines, but their medicine chests poison. Some are not ashamed of their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>; but they invent defences for their baseness, so that they may appear even to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</q> Seneca also says: <q>The wise man will even do things which he will not approve of, that he may find means of passing to the accomplishment of greater things; nor will he abandon good morals, but will adapt them to the occasion; and those things which others employ for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or pleasure, he will employ for the sake of action.</q> Then he says shortly afterwards: <q>All things which the luxurious and the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> do, the wise man also will do, but not in the same manner, and with the same purpose. But it makes no difference with what intention you act, when the action itself is vicious; because acts are seen, the intention is not seen.</q></p>

<p>Aristippus, the master of the Cyrenaics, had a criminal intimacy with Lais, the celebrated courtesan; and that grave teacher of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> defended this fault by saying, that there was a great difference between him and the other lovers of Lais, because he himself possessed Lais, whereas others were possessed by Lais. O illustrious wisdom, to be imitated by good men! Would you, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, entrust your children to this man for education, that they might learn to possess a harlot? He said that there was some difference between himself and the dissolute, that they wasted their property, whereas he lived in indulgence without any cost. And in this the harlot was plainly the wiser, who had the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> as her creature, that all the youth, corrupted by the example and authority of the teacher, might flock together to her without any shame. What difference therefore did it make, with what intention the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> betook himself to that most notorious harlot, when the people and his rivals saw him more depraved than all the abandoned? Nor was it enough to live in this manner, but he began also to teach <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>; and he transferred his habits from the brothel to the school, contending that bodily pleasure was the chief good. Which pernicious and shameful doctrine has its origin not in the heart of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, but in the bosom of the harlot.</p>

<p>For why should I speak of the <a href="../cathen/04582a.htm">Cynics</a>, who practised licentiousness in public? What wonder if they derived their name and title from dogs,  since they also imitated their life? Therefore there is no instruction of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, since even those who enjoin more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> things either themselves do not practice what they advise; or if they do (which rarely happens), it is not the system which leads them to that which is right, but nature which often impels even the unlearned to praise.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. That the Philosophers Who Give Good Instructions Live Badly, by the Testimony of Cicero; Therefore We Should Not So Much Devote Ourselves to the Study of Philosophy as to Wisdom.</h2>

<p>But when they give themselves up to perpetual sloth, and undertake no exercise of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and pass their whole life in the practice of speaking, in what light ought they to be regarded rather than as triflers? For wisdom, unless it is engaged on some action on which it may exert its force, is empty and false; and Tullius rightly gives the preference, above teachers of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, to those men employed in civil affairs, who govern the state, who found new cities or maintain with equity those already founded, who preserve the safety and liberty of the citizens either by good <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or wholesome counsels, or by weighty judgments. For it is right to make men good rather than to give precepts about duty to those shut up in corners, which precepts are not observed even by those who speak them; and inasmuch as they have withdrawn themselves from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> actions, it is manifest that they invented the system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself, for the purpose of exercising the tongue, or for the sake of pleading. But they who merely teach without acting, of themselves detract from the weight of their own precepts; for who would <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, when they who give the precepts themselves teach disobedience? Moreover, it is a good thing to give right and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> precepts; but unless you also practice them it is a deceit, and it is inconsistent and trifling to have goodness not in the heart, but on the lips.</p>

<p>It is not therefore utility, but enjoyment, which they seek from <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. And this Cicero indeed testified. <q>Truly,</q> he says, <q>all their disputation, although it contains most abundant fountains of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, yet, when compared with their actions and accomplishments, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest it should seem not to have brought so much advantage to the business of men as enjoyment to their times of relaxation.</q> He ought not to have feared, since he spoke the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but as if he were afraid lest he should be arraigned by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> on a charge of betraying a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, he did not venture confidently to pronounce that which was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that they do not dispute for the purpose of teaching, but for their own enjoyment in their leisure; and since they are the advisers of actions, and do not themselves act at all, they are to be regarded as mere talkers.  But assuredly, because they contributed no advantage to life, they neither <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> their own decrees, nor has any one been found, through so many ages, who lived in accordance with their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>  must altogether be laid aside, because we are not to devote ourselves to the pursuit of wisdom, for this has no limit or moderation; but we must be wise, and that indeed quickly. For a second life is not granted to us, so that when we seek wisdom in this life we may be wise in that; each result must be brought about in this life. It ought to be quickly found, in order that it may be quickly taken up, lest any part of life should pass away, the end of which is uncertain. Hortensius in Cicero, contending against <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, is pressed by a clever argument; inasmuch as, when he said that men ought not to philosophize, he seemed nevertheless to philosophize, since it is the part of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> to discuss what ought and what ought not to be done in life. We are free and exempt from this <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, who take away <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, because it is the invention of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> thought; we defend wisdom, because it is a divine tradition, and we testify that it ought to be taken up by all. He, when he took away <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> without introducing anything better, was supposed to take away wisdom; and on that account was more easily driven from his opinion, because it is agreed upon that man is not born to folly, but to wisdom.</p>

<p>Moreover, the argument which the same Hortensius employed has great weight also against <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>&mdash;namely, that it may be understood from this, that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is not wisdom, since its beginning and origin are apparent. When, he says, did <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> begin to exist? Thales, <span style="italic">as I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a></span>, was the first, and his age was recent. Where, then, among the more ancient men did that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of investigating the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> lie hidden? Lucretius also says: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Then, too, this nature and system of things has been discovered lately, and I the very first of all have only now been found able to transfer it into native words.</q></p></blockquote><p>And Seneca says: <q>There are not yet a thousand years since the beginnings of wisdom were undertaken.</q> Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> for many generations lived without system. In ridicule of which, Persius says: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>When wisdom came to the city, <br>Together with pepper and palms;</q></p></blockquote><p>as though wisdom had been introduced into the city together with savoury merchandise.  For if it is in agreement with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it must have had its commencement together with man; but if it is not in agreement with it, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would be incapable of receiving it. But, inasmuch as it has received it, it follows that wisdom has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from the beginning: therefore <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, inasmuch as it has not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from the beginning, is not the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom. But, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the Greeks, because they had not attained to the sacred letters of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how wisdom was corrupted. And, therefore, since they thought that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life was destitute of wisdom, they invented <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; that is, they wished by discussion to tear up the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which was lying hid and unknown to them: and this employment, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they thought to be wisdom. </p>

<h2>Chapter 17. He Passes from Philosophy to the Philosophers, Beginning with Epicurus; And How He Regarded Leucippus and Democritus as Authors of Error.</h2>

<p>I have spoken on the subject of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself as briefly as I could; now let us come to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, not that we may contend with these, who cannot maintain their ground, but that we may pursue those who are in flight and driven from our battlefield. The system of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> was much more generally followed than those of the others; not because it brings forward any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but because the attractive name of pleasure invites many.  For every one is naturally inclined to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Moreover, for the purpose of drawing the multitude to himself, he speaks that which is specially adapted to each character separately. He forbids the idle to apply himself to learning; he releases the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man from giving largesses to the people; he prohibits the inactive man from undertaking the business of the state, the sluggish from bodily exercise, the timid from military service. The irreligious is told that the gods pay no attention to the conduct of men; the man who is unfeeling and selfish is ordered to give nothing to any one, for that the wise man does everything on his own account. To a man who avoids the crowd, solitude is praised. One who is too sparing, learns that life can be sustained on water and meal. If a man <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his wife, the blessings of celibacy are enumerated to him; to one who has bad children, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of those who are without children is proclaimed; against unnatural  <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> it is said that there is no bond of nature. To the man who is delicate and incapable of endurance, it is said that pain is the greatest of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; to the man of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, it is said that the wise man is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> even under tortures. The man who devotes himself to the pursuit of influence and distinction is enjoined to pay court to kings; he who cannot endure annoyance is enjoined to shun the abode of kings. Thus the crafty man collects an assembly from various and differing characters; and while he lays himself out to please all, he is more at variance with himself than they all are with one another. But we must explain from what source the whole of this system is derived, and what origin it has.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> saw that the good are always subject to adversities, poverty, labours, exile, loss of dear friends. On the contrary, he saw that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> were <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; that they were exalted with influence, and loaded with honours; he saw that innocence was unprotected, that crimes were committed with impunity: he saw that death raged without any regard to character, without any arrangement or discrimination of age; but that some arrived at old age, while others were carried off in their infancy; that some died when they were now robust and vigorous, that others were cut off by an untimely death in the first flower of youth; that in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> the better men were especially overcome and slain. But that which especially moved him, was the fact that religious men were especially visited with weightier <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, whereas he saw that less <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> or none at all fell upon those who altogether neglected the gods, or worshipped them in an impious manner; and that even the very temples themselves were often set on fire by lightning. And of this Lucretius complains,  when he says respecting the god:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Then he may hurl lightnings, and often throw down his temples, and withdrawing into the deserts, there spend his rage in practising his bolt, which often passes the guilty by, and strikes dead the innocent and unoffending.</q></p></blockquote><p>But if he had been able to collect even a small particle of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he would never say that the god throws down his own temples, when he throws them down on this account, because they are not his. The Capitol, which is the chief seat of the Roman city and religion, was struck with lightning and set on fire not once only, but frequently. But what was the opinion of clever men respecting this is evident from the saying of Cicero, who says that the flame came from heaven, not to destroy that earthly dwelling-place of Jupiter, but to demand a loftier and more magnificent abode. Concerning which transaction, in the books respecting his consulship, he speaks to the same purport as Lucretius:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p>For the father thundering on high, throned in the lofty Olympus, himself assailed his own citadels and famed temples, and cast fires upon his abode in the Capitol.</p></blockquote><p>In the obstinacy of their folly, therefore, they not only did not understand the power and majesty of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but they even increased the impiety of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, in endeavouring against all divine law to restore a temple so often condemned by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, when <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> reflected on these things, induced as it were by the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of these matters (for thus it appeared to him in his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and subject), he thought that there was no <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>.  And having persuaded himself of this, he undertook also to defend it, and thus he entangled himself in inextricable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. For if there is no <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, how is it that the world was made with such order and arrangement? He says: There is no arrangement, for many things are made in a different manner from that in which they ought to have been made. And the divine man found subjects of censure. Now, if I had leisure to refute these things separately, I could easily show that this man was neither wise nor of sound mind. Also, if there is no <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, how is it that the bodies of animals are arranged with such foresight, that the various members, being disposed in a wonderful manner, discharge their own offices individually? The system of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, he says, contrived nothing in the production of animals; for neither were the eyes made for seeing, nor the ears for hearing, nor the tongue for speaking, nor the feet for walking; inasmuch as these were produced before it was possible to speak, to hear, to see, and to walk. Therefore these were not produced for use; but use was produced from them. If there is no <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, why do rains fall, fruits spring up, and trees put forth leaves? These things, he says, are not always done for the sake of living creatures, inasmuch as they are of no benefit to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>; but all things must be produced of their own accord. From what source, therefore, do they arise,  or how are all things which are carried on brought about? There is no need, he says, of supposing a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>; for there are seeds floating through the empty void, and from these, collected together without order, all things are produced and take their form. Why, then, do we not perceive or distinguish them? Because, he says, they have neither any colour, nor warmth, nor smell; they are also without flavour and moisture; and they are so minute, that they cannot be cut and divided.</p>

<p>Thus, because he had taken up a false principle at the commencement, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the subjects which followed led him to absurdities. For where or from whence are these atoms? Why did no one dream of them besides Leucippus only? From whom Democritus,  having received instructions, left to <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> the inheritance of his folly. And if these are minute bodies, and indeed solid, as they say, they certainly are able to fall under the notice of the eyes. If the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of all things is the same, how is it that they compose various objects? They meet together, he says, in varied order and position as the letters which, though few in number, by variety of arrangement make up innumerable words. But it is urged the letters have a variety of forms. And so, he says, have these first principles; for they are rough, they are furnished with hooks, they are smooth. Therefore they can be cut and divided, if there is in them any part which projects. But if they are smooth and without hooks, they cannot cohere. They ought therefore to he hooked, that they may be linked together one with another. But since they are said to be so minute that they cannot be cut asunder by the edge of any weapon, how is it that they have hooks or angles? For it must be possible for these to be torn asunder, since they project. In the next place, by what mutual compact, by what discernment, do they meet together, so that anything may be constructed out of them? If they are without intelligence, they cannot come together in such order and arrangement; for nothing but reason can bring to accomplishment anything in accordance with reason. With how many arguments can this trifling be refuted! But I must proceed with my subject. This is he</p> <blockquote><p><q>Who surpassed in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and quenched the light of all, as the ethereal sun arisen quenches the stars.</q> </p></blockquote><p>Which verses I am never able to read without laughter. For this was not said respecting Socrates or <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who are esteemed as kings of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, but concerning a man who, though of sound mind and vigorous health, raved more senselessly than any one diseased. And thus the most vain poet, I do not say adorned, but overwhelmed and crushed, the mouse with the praises of the lion. But the same man also releases us from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, respecting which these are his own exact words:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>When we are in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, death does not exist; when death exists, we have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>: therefore death is nothing to us.</q></p></blockquote><p>How cleverly he has deceived us! As though it were death now completed which is an object of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, by which sensation has been already taken away, and not the very act of dying, by which sensation is being taken from us. For there is a time in which we ourselves even yet  exist, and death does not yet exist; and that very time appears to be miserable, because death is beginning to exist, and we are ceasing to exist.</p>

<p>Nor is it said without reason that death is not miserable. The approach of death is miserable; that is, to waste away by disease, to endure the thrust, to receive the weapon in the body, to be burnt with fire, to be torn by the teeth of beasts. These are the things which are feared, not because they bring death, but because they bring great pain. But rather make out that pain is not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. He says it is the greatest of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. How therefore can I fail to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, if that which precedes or brings about death is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? Why should I say that the argument is false, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> do not perish? But, he says, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> do perish; for that which is born with the body must perish with the body. I have already stated that I prefer to put off the discussion of this subject, and to reserve it for the last part of my work, that I may refute this persuasion of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, whether it was that of Democritus or Dic&aelig;archus, both by arguments and divine testimonies. But perhaps he promised himself impunity in the indulgence of his <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>; for he was an advocate of most disgraceful pleasure, and said that man was born for its enjoyment.  Who, when he hears this affirmed, would abstain from the practice of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? For; if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is doomed to perish, let us eagerly pursue riches, that we may be able to enjoy all kinds of indulgence; and if these are wanting to us, let us take them away from those who have them by stealth, by stratagem, or by force, especially if there is no God who regards the actions of men: as long as the hope of impunity shall favour us, let us plunder and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.  For it is the part of the wise man to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, if it is advantageous to him, and safe; since, if there is a God in heaven, He is not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with any one. It is also equally the part of the foolish man to do good; because, as he is not excited with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, so he is not influenced by favour. Therefore let us live in the indulgence of pleasures in every possible way; for in a short time we shall not exist at all. Therefore let us suffer no day, in short, no moment of time, to pass away from us without pleasure; lest, since we ourselves are doomed to perish, the life which we have already spent should itself also perish.</p>

<p>Although he does not say this in word, yet he teaches it in fact. For when he maintains that the wise man does everything for his own sake, he refers all things which he does to his own advantage. And thus he who hears these disgraceful things, will neither think that any good thing ought to be done, since the conferring of benefits has reference to the advantage of another; nor that he ought to abstain from guilt, because the doing of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is attended with gain. If any chieftain of pirates or leader of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> were exhorting his men to acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, what other language could he employ than to say the same things which <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> says: that the gods take no notice; that they are not affected with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> nor kind feeling; that the punishment of a future state is not to be dreaded, because <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> die after death, and that there is no future state of punishment at all; that pleasure is the greatest good; that there is no society among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; that every one consults for his own interest; that there is no one who loves another, unless it be for his own sake; that death is not to be feared by a brave man, nor any pain; for that he, even if he should be tortured or burnt, should say that he does not regard it. There is evidently sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why any one should regard this as the expression of a wise man, since it can most fittingly be applied to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>!</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. The Pythagoreans and Stoics, While They Hold the Immortality of the Soul, Foolishly Persuade a Voluntary Death.</h2>

<p>Others, again, discuss things contrary to these, namely, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> survives after death; and these are chiefly the Pythagoreans and <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>. And although they are to be treated with indulgence because they perceive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, yet I cannot but blame them, because they fell upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> not by their opinion, but by accident. And thus they erred in some degree even in that very matter which they rightly perceived. For, since they feared the argument by which it is inferred that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must necessarily die with the body, because it is born with the body, they asserted that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not born with the body, but rather introduced into it, and that it migrates from one body to another. They did not consider that it was possible for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to survive the body, unless it should appear to have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> previously to the body. There is therefore an equal and almost similar <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> on each side. But the one side are deceived with respect to the past, the other with respect to the future. For no one saw that which is most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is both created and does not die, because they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> why that came to pass, or what was the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man. Many therefore of them, because they suspected that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, laid violent hands upon themselves, as though they were about to depart to heaven. Thus it was with Cleanthes  and Chrysippus,  with Zeno,  and Empedocles,  who in the dead of night cast himself into a cavity of the burning &AElig;tna, that when he had suddenly disappeared it might be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that he had departed to the gods; and thus also of the Romans Cato died, who through the whole of his life was an imitator of Socratic ostentation. For Democritus  was of another persuasion. But, however,</p> <blockquote><p>By his own spontaneous act he offered up his head to death;  </p></blockquote><p>and nothing can be more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> than this. For if a homicide is guilty because he is a destroyer of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he who puts himself to death is under the same guilt, because he puts to death a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Yea, that crime may be considered to be greater, the punishment of which belongs to God alone. For as we did not come into this life of our own accord; so, on the other hand, we can only withdraw from this habitation of the body which has been appointed for us to keep, by the command of Him who placed us in this body that we may inhabit it, until He orders us to depart from it; and if any <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is offered to us, we must endure it with equanimity, since the death of an innocent person cannot be unavenged, and since we have a great Judge who alone always has the power of taking vengeance in His hands.</p>

<p>All these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, therefore, were homicides; and Cato himself, the chief of Roman wisdom, who, before he put himself to death, is said to have read through the treatise of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> which he wrote on the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and was led by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> to the commission of this great crime; yet he, however, appears to have had some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for death in his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of slavery. Why should I speak of the Ambraciot,  who, having read the same treatise, threw himself into the sea, for no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> than that he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>?&mdash; a doctrine altogether detestable and to be avoided, if it drives men from life. But if <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and taught by whom, and how, and to whom, and on account of what actions, and at what time, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> is given, he would neither have driven Cleombrotus nor Cato to a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> death, but he would have trained them to live with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For it appears to me that Cato sought a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for death, not so much that he might escape from C&aelig;sar, as that he might <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, whom he followed, and might make his name distinguished by some great action; and I do not see what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> could have happened to him if he had lived. For Caius C&aelig;sar, such was his clemency, had no other object, even in the very heat of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, than to appear to deserve well of the state, by preserving two excellent citizens, Cicero and Cato. But let us return to those who praise death as a benefit. You complain of life as though you had lived, or had ever settled with yourself why you were born at all. May not therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and common Father of all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> find fault with that saying of Terence: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>First, learn in what life consists; then, if you shall be dissatisfied with life, have recourse to death.</q></p></blockquote><p>You are indignant that you are exposed to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; as though you deserved anything good, who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of your Father, Lord, and King; who, although you behold with your eyes the bright light, are nevertheless blind in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and lie in the depths of the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. And this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> has caused that some have not been ashamed to say, that we are born for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, that we may suffer the punishment of our crimes; but I do not see what can be more senseless than this. For where or what crimes could we have committed when we did not even exist? Unless we shall happen to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that foolish old man,  who <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> said <span style="italic">that </span> <span style="italic">he had lived before, and</span> that in his former life he had been Euphorbus. He, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because he was born of an ignoble race, chose for himself a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> from the poems of Homer. O wonderful and remarkable memory of Pythagoras! O miserable forgetfulness on the part of us all, since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not who we were in our former life! But perhaps it was caused by some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, or favour, that he alone did not touch the abyss of Lethe, or taste the water of oblivion; doubtless the trifling old man (as is wont to be the case with old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who are free from occupation) invented fables as it were for credulous infants. But if he had thought well of those to whom he spoke these things; if he had considered them to be men, he would never have claimed to himself the liberty of uttering such perverse falsehoods. But the folly of this most trifling man is deserving of ridicule. What shall we do in the case of Cicero, who, having said in the beginning of his <em>Consolation</em> that men were born for the sake of atoning for their crimes, afterwards repeated the assertion, as though rebuking him who does not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that life is a punishment? He was right, therefore, in saying beforehand that he was held by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and wretched <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Cicero and Others of the Wisest Men Teach the Immortality of the Soul, But in an Unbelieving Manner; And that a Good or an Evil Death Must Be Weighed from the Previous Life.</h2>

<p>But those who assert the advantage of death, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, thus reason: If there is nothing after death, death is not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; for it takes away the perception of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> survives, death is even an advantage; because <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> follows. And this sentiment is thus set forth by Cicero concerning the Laws:  <q>We may congratulate ourselves, since death is about to bring either a better state than that which exists in life, or at any rate not a worse. For if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in a state of vigour without the body, it is a divine life; and if it is without perception, assuredly there is no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> Cleverly argued, as it appeared to himself, as though there could be no other state. But each conclusion is false. For the sacred writings  teach that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not annihilated; but that it is either rewarded according to its righteousness, or <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> punished according to its crimes. For neither is it right, that he who has lived a life of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in prosperity should escape the punishment which he deserves; nor that he who has been wretched on account of his righteousness, should be deprived of his reward. And this is so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that Tully also, in his <em>Consolation</em>, declared that the righteous and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> do not inhabit the same abodes. For those same wise men, he says, did not judge that the same course was open for all into the heaven; for they taught that those who were contaminated by <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and crimes were thrust down into darkness, and lay in the mire; but that, on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that were chaste, pure, upright, and uncontaminated, being also refined by the study and practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by a light and easy course take their flight to the gods, that is, to a nature resembling their own. But this sentiment is opposed to the former argument. For that is based on the assumption that every man at his birth is presented with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. What distinction, therefore, will there be between <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and guilt, if it makes no difference whether a man be <a href="../cathen/01712d.htm">Aristides</a> or Phalaris, whether he be Cato or Catiline? But a man does not perceive this opposition between sentiments and actions, unless he is in possession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. If any one, therefore, should ask me whether death is a good or an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, I shall reply that its character depends upon the course of the life. For as life itself is a good if it is passed virtuously, but an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> if it is spent viciously, so also death is to be weighed in accordance with the past actions of life. And so it comes to pass, that if life has been passed in the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, death is not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for it is a translation to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. But if not so, death must necessarily be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since it transfers men, as I have said, to everlasting punishment. </p>

<p>What, then, shall we say, but that they are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> who either desire death as a good, or flee from life as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? Unless they are most <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, who do not weigh the fewer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> against the greater number of blessings. For when they pass all their lives in a variety of the choicest gratifications, if any bitterness has chanced to succeed to these, they desire to die; and they so regard it as to appear never to have fared well, if at any time they happen to fare ill. Therefore they condemn the whole of life, and consider it as nothing else than filled with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Hence arose that foolish sentiment, that this state which we <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> to be life is death, and that that which we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> as death is life; and so that the first good is not to be born, that the second is an early death. And that this sentiment may be of greater weight, it is attributed to Silenus.  Cicero in his <em>Consolation</em> says: <q>Not to be born is by far the best thing, and not to fall upon these rocks of life. But the next thing is, if you have been born, to die as soon as possible, and to flee from the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of fortune as from a conflagration.</q> That he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> this most foolish expression appears from this, that he added something of his own for its embellishment. I ask, therefore, for whom he thinks it best not to be born, when there is no one at all who has any perception; for it is the perception which causes anything to be good or bad. In the next place, why did he regard the whole of life as nothing else than rocks, and a conflagration; as though it were either in our power not to be born, or life were given to us by fortune, and not by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or as though the course of life appeared to bear any resemblance to a conflagration?</p>

<p>The saying of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is not dissimilar, that he gave thanks to nature, first that he was born a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being rather than a dumb animal; in the next place, that he was a man rather than a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; that he was a Greek rather than a barbarian;  lastly, that he was an Athenian, and that he was born in the time of Socrates. It is impossible to say what great blindness and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> are produced by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> would altogether contend that nothing in the affairs of men was ever spoken more foolishly. As though, if he had been born a barbarian, or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or, in fine, an ass, he would be the same <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and not that very being which had been produced. But he evidently <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Pythagoras, who, in order that he might prevent men from feeding on animals, said that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> passed from the bodies of men to the bodies of other animals; which is both foolish and impossible. It is foolish, because it was unnecessary to introduce <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that have long <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> into new bodies, when the same Artificer who at one time had made the first, was always able to make fresh ones; it is impossible, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> endued with right reason can no more change the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its condition, than fire can rush downwards, or, like a river, pour its flame obliquely.  The wise man therefore imagined, that it might come to pass that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which was then in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> might be shut up in some other animal, and might be endued with the sensibility of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so as to understand and grieve that it was burthened with an incongruous body. How much more rationally would he have acted, if he had said that he gave thanks because he was born with a good capacity, and capable of receiving instruction, and that he was possessed of those resources which enabled him to receive a liberal education! For what benefit was it that he was born at Athens? Have not many men of distinguished talent and learning lived in other cities, who were better individually than all the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>? How many thousands must we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there were, who, though born at Athens, and in the times of Socrates, were nevertheless unlearned and foolish? For it is not the walls or the place in which any one was born that can invest a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with wisdom. Of what avail was it to congratulate himself that he was born in the times of Socrates? Was Socrates able to supply talent to learners? It did not occur to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> that Alcibiades also, and Critias, were constant hearers of the same Socrates, the one of whom was the most active enemy of his country, the other the most cruel of all tyrants.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Socrates Had More Knowledge in Philosophy Than Other Men, Although in Many Things He Acted Foolishly.</h2>

<p>Let us now see what there was so great in Socrates himself, that a wise man deservedly gave thanks that he was born in his times. I do not deny that he was a little more sagacious than the others who thought that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things could be comprehended by the mind. And in this I judge that they were not only senseless, but also impious; because they wished to send their inquisitive eyes into the secrets of that heavenly <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there are at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in many cities, certain sacred things which it is considered impious for men to look upon. Therefore they who are not permitted to pollute those objects abstain from looking upon them; and if by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or some accident a man has happened to see them, his guilt is expiated first by his punishment, and afterwards by a repetition of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. What can you do in the case of those who wish to pry into unpermitted things? Truly they are much more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> who seek to profane the secrets of the world and this heavenly temple with impious disputations, than those who entered the temple of Vesta, or the Good Goddess, or Ceres. And these shrines, though it is not lawful for men to approach them, were yet constructed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But these men not only escape the charge of impiety, but, that which is much more unbecoming, they gain the fame of eloquence and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of talent. What if they were able to investigate anything? For they are as foolish in asserting as they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in searching out; since they are neither able to find out anything, nor, even if they had found out anything, to defend it. For if even by chance they have seen the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash; a thing which often happens&mdash; they so act that it is refuted by others as false. For no one descends from heaven to pass sentence on the opinions of individuals; wherefore no one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that those who seek after these things are foolish, senseless, and insane.</p>

<p>Socrates therefore had something of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom,  who, when he understood that these things could not possibly be ascertained, removed himself from questions of this kind; but I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that he so acted in this alone. For many of his actions are not only undeserving of praise, but also most deserving of censure, in which things he most resembled those of his own class. Out of these I will select one which may be judged of by all. Socrates used this well-known proverb: <q>That which is above us is nothing to us.</q> Let us therefore fall down upon the earth, and use as feet those hands which have been given us for the production of excellent works. The heaven is nothing to us, to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of which we have been raised;  in fine, the light itself can have no reference to us; undoubtedly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our sustenance is from heaven. But if he perceived this, that we ought not to discuss the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of heavenly things, he was unable even to comprehend the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of those things which he had beneath his feet. What then? Did he <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in his words? It is not probable; but he undoubtedly meant that which he said, that we are not to devote ourselves to religion; but if he were openly to say this, no one would suffer it.</p>

<p>For who cannot perceive that this world, completed with such wonderful method, is governed by some <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, since there is nothing which can exist without some one to direct it? Thus, a house deserted by its inhabitant fails to decay; a ship without a pilot goes to the bottom; and a body abandoned by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> wastes away. Much less can we suppose that so great a fabric could either have been constructed without an Artificer, or have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> so long without a Ruler. But if he wished to overthrow those public <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>, I do not disapprove of this; yea, I shall rather praise it, if he shall have found anything better <span style="italic">to take their place</span> . But the same man swore  by a dog and a goose. Oh buffoon (as Zeno the Epicurean  says), senseless, abandoned, desperate man, if he wished to scoff at religion; madman, if he did this seriously, so as to esteem a most base animal as God! For who can dare to find fault with the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> of the Egyptians, when Socrates confirmed them at Athens by his authority? But was it not a mark of consummate vanity, that before his death he asked his friends to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for him a cock which he had vowed to &AElig;sculapius? He evidently feared lest he should be put upon his trial before Rhadamanthus, the judge, by &AElig;sculapius on account of the vow. I should consider him most mad if he had died under the influence of disease. But since he did this in his sound <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he who thinks that he was wise is himself of unsound mind. Behold one in whose times the wise man congratulates himself as having been born!</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Of the System of Plato, Which Would Lead to the Overthrow of States.</h2>

<p>Let us, however, see what it was that he learned from Socrates, who, having entirely rejected natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, betook himself to inquiries about <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and duty. And thus I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he instructed his hearers in the precepts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore, under the teaching of Socrates, it did not escape the notice of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, that the force of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in equality, since all are born in an equal condition. Therefore (he says) they must have nothing private or their own; but that they may be equal, as the method of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> requires, they must possess all things in common. This is capable of being endured, as long as it appears to be spoken of money. But how impossible and how <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> this is, I could show by many things. Let us, however, admit its possibility. For grant that all are wise, and despise money. To what, then, did that community lead him? Marriages also, be says, ought to be in common; so that many men may flock together like dogs to the same <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and he who shall be superior in strength may succeed in obtaining her; or if they are patient as <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, they may await their turns, as in a brothel. Oh the wonderful equality of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>! Where, then, is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>? Where conjugal fidelity? And if you take away these, all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is taken away. But he also says that states would be prosperous, if either <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were their kings, or their kings were <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. But if you were to give the sovereignty to this man of such <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and equity, who had deprived some of their own property, and given to some the property of others, he would prostitute the modesty of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; a thing which was never done, I do not say by a king, but not even by a tyrant.</p>

<p>But what motive did he advance for this most degrading advice? The state will be in harmony, and bound together with the bonds of mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, if all shall be the husbands, and fathers, and wives, and children of all. What a confusion of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is this? How is it possible for affection to be preserved where there is nothing certain to be loved? What man will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or what <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unless they shall always have lived together&mdash;unless devotedness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> mutually preserved, shall have made their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> indivisible? But this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has no place in that promiscuous pleasure. Moreover, if all are the children of all, who will be able to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> children as his own, when he is either <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> or in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether they are his own? Who will bestow <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> upon any one as a father, when he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from whom he was born? From which it comes to pass, that he not only esteems a stranger as a father, but also a father as a stranger. Why should I say that it is possible for a wife to be common, but impossible for a son, who cannot be conceived except from one? The community, therefore, is lost to him alone, nature herself crying out against it. It remains that it is only for the sake of concord that he would have a community of wives. But there is no more vehement <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of discords, than the desire of one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by many men. And in this <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> might have been admonished, if not by reason, yet certainly by example, both of the dumb animals, which fight most vehemently on this account, and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who have always carried on most severe <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with one another on account of this matter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Of the Precepts of Plato, and Censures of the Same.</h2>

<p>It remains that the community of which we have spoken admits of nothing else but adulteries and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, for the utter extinction of which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is especially necessary. Therefore he did not find the concord which he sought, because he did not see whence it arises. For <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has no weight in outward circumstances, not even in the body,  but it is altogether employed on the mind of man. He, therefore, who wishes to place men on an equality, ought not to take away marriage and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, but arrogance, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and haughtiness, that those who are powerful and lifted up on high may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are on a level even with the most needy. For insolence and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> being taken from the rich, it will make no difference whether some are rich and others poor, since they will be equal in spirit, and nothing but reverence towards God can produce this result. He thought, therefore, that he had found <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereas he had altogether removed it, because it ought not to be a community of perishable things, but of minds. For if <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the mother  of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, when they are severally taken away, it is also itself overthrown. But <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> took away above all things frugality, which has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> when there is no property of one's own which can be possessed; he took away abstinence, since there will be nothing belonging to another from which one can abstain; he took away <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, which are the greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in each sex; he took away self-respect, shame, and modesty, if those things which are accustomed to be judged base and disgraceful begin to be accounted <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and lawful. Thus, while he wishes to confer <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> upon all, he takes it away from all. For the ownership of property contains the material both of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but a community of goods contains nothing else than the licentiousness of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. For men who have many mistresses can be called nothing else than luxurious and prodigal. And likewise <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who are in the possession of many men, must of necessity be not adulteresses, because they have no fixed marriage, but prostitutes and harlots. Therefore he reduced <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, I do not say to the likeness of dumb animals, but of the herds and brutes. For almost all the birds contract marriages, and are united in pairs, and defend their nests, as though their marriage-beds, with harmonious <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and cherish their own young, because they are well known to them; and if you put others in their way, they repel them. But this wise man, contrary to the custom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and contrary to nature, chose more foolish objects of imitation; and since he saw that the duties of males and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> were not separated in the case of other animals, he thought that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also ought to engage in warfare, and take a share in the public counsels, and undertake magistracies, and assume commands. And therefore he assigned to them horses and arms: it follows that he should have assigned to men wool and the loom, and the carrying of infants. Nor did he see the impossibility of what he said, from the fact that no nation has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the world so foolish or so vain as to live in this manner. </p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Of the Errors of Certain Philosophers, and of the Sun and Moon.</h2>

<p>Since, therefore, the leading men among the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are themselves discovered to be of such emptiness, what shall we think of those lesser  ones, who are accustomed never to appear to themselves so wise, as when they boast of their contempt of money? Brave spirit! But I wait to see their conduct, and what are the results of that contempt. They avoid as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and abandon the property handed down to them from their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. And lest they should suffer shipwreck in a storm, they plunge headlong of their own accord in a calm, being resolute not by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but by perverse <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; as those who, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of being slain by the enemy, slay themselves, that by death they may avoid death. So these men, without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and without influence, throw away the means by which they might have acquired the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of liberality. Democritus is praised because he abandoned his fields, and suffered them to become public pastures. I should approve of it, if he had given them. But nothing is done wisely which is useless and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> if it is done by all. But this negligence is tolerable. What shall I say of him who changed his possessions into money, which he threw into the sea? I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether he was in his senses, or deranged. Away, he says, you <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires, into the deep. I will cast you away, lest I myself should be cast away by you. If you have so great a contempt for money, employ it in acts of kindness and humanity, bestow it upon the poor; this, which you are about to throw away, may be a succour to many, so that they may not die through famine, or thirst, or nakedness. Imitate at least the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and fury of Tuditanus;  scatter abroad your property to be seized by the people. You have it in your power both to escape the possession of money, and yet to lay it out to advantage; for whatever has been profitable to many is securely laid out.</p>

<p>But who approves of the equality of faults as laid down by Zeno? But let us omit that which is always received with derision by all. This is sufficient to prove the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of this madman, that he places pity among <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and diseases. He deprives us of an affection, which involves almost the whole course of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. For since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man is more feeble than that of the other animals, which <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> has armed with natural means of protection,  either to endure the severity of the seasons or to ward off attacks from their bodies, because none of these things has been given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he has received in the place of all these things the affection of pity, which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called humanity, by which we might mutually protect each other. For if a man were rendered savage by the sight of another man, which we see happen in the case of those animals which are of a solitary  nature, there would be no society among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, no care or system in the building of cities; and thus life would not even be safe, since the weakness of men would both be exposed to the attacks of the other animals, and they would rage among themselves after the manner of wild beasts. Nor is his <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> less in other things.</p>

<p>For what can be said respecting him who asserted that snow was black? How naturally it followed, that he should also assert that pitch was white! This is he who said that he was born for this purpose, that he might behold the heaven and the sun, who beheld nothing on the earth when the sun was shining. Xenophanes most foolishly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> mathematicians who said that the orb of the moon was eighteen times larger than the earth; and, as was consistent with this folly, he said that within the concave surface of the moon there was another earth, and that there another race of men live in a similar manner to that in which we live on this earth. Therefore these lunatics have another moon, to hold forth to them a light by night, as this does to us. And perhaps this globe of ours may be a moon to another earth below this.  Seneca says that there was one among the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> who used to deliberate whether he should assign to the sun also its own inhabitants; he acted foolishly in doubting. For what injury would he have inflicted if he had assigned them? But I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the heat deterred him, so as not to imperil so great a multitude; lest, if they should perish through excessive heat, so great a calamity should be said to have happened by his fault.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Of the Antipodes, the Heaven, and the Stars.</h2>

<p>How is it with those who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that there are antipodes  opposite to our footsteps? Do they say anything to the purpose? Or is there any one so senseless as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there are men whose footsteps are higher than their heads? Or that the things which with us are in a recumbent position, with them hang in an inverted direction? That the crops and trees grow downwards? That the rains, and snow, and hail fall upwards to the earth? And does any one wonder that hanging gardens  are mentioned among the seven wonders of the world, when <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> make hanging fields, and seas, and cities, and mountains? The origin of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> must also be set forth by us. For they are always deceived in the same manner. For when they have assumed anything false in the commencement of their investigations, led by the resemblance of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they necessarily fall into those things which are its consequences. Thus they fall into many ridiculous things; because those things which are in agreement with false things, must themselves be false. But since they placed confidence in the first, they do not consider the character of those things which follow, but defend them in every way; whereas they ought to judge from those which follow, whether the first are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or false.</p>

<p>What course of argument, therefore, led them to the idea of the antipodes? They saw the courses of the stars travelling towards the west; they saw that the sun and the moon always set towards the same quarter, and rise from the same. But since they did not perceive what contrivance regulated their courses, nor how they returned from the west to the east, but supposed that the heaven itself sloped downwards in every direction, which appearance it must present on account of its immense breadth, they thought that the world is round like a ball, and they fancied that the heaven revolves in accordance with the motion of the heavenly bodies; and thus that the stars and sun, when they have set, by the very rapidity of the motion of the world  are borne back to the east. Therefore they both constructed brazen orbs, as though after the figure of the world, and engraved upon them certain monstrous images, which they said were constellations. It followed, therefore, from this rotundity of the heaven, that the earth was enclosed in the midst of its curved surface. But if this were so, the earth also itself must be like a globe; for that could not possibly be anything but round, which was held enclosed by that which was round. But if the earth also were round, it must necessarily happen that it should present the same appearance to all parts of the heaven; that is, that it should raise aloft mountains, extend plains, and have level seas. And if this were so, that last consequence also followed, that there would be no part of the earth uninhabited by men and the other animals. Thus the rotundity of the earth leads, in addition, to the invention of those suspended antipodes. </p>

<p>But if you inquire from those who defend these marvellous fictions, why all things do not fall into that lower part of the heaven, they reply that such is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things, that heavy bodies are borne to the middle, and that they are all joined together towards the middle, as we see spokes in a wheel; but that the bodies which are light, as mist, smoke, and fire, are borne away from the middle, so as to seek the heaven. I am at a loss what to say respecting those who, when they have once erred, consistently persevere in their folly, and defend one vain thing by another; but that I sometimes <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they either discuss <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> for the sake of a jest, or purposely and knowingly undertake to defend falsehoods, as if to exercise or display their talents on false subjects. But I should be able to prove by many arguments that it is impossible for the heaven to be lower than the earth, were is not that this book must now be concluded, and that some things still remain, which are more necessary for the present work. And since it is not the work of a single book to run over the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of each individually, let it be sufficient to have enumerated a few, from which the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the others may be understood.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. Of Learning Philosophy, and What Great Qualifications are Necessary for Its Pursuit.</h2>

<p>We must now speak a few things concerning <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in general, that having strengthened our <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we may conclude. That greatest imitator of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> among our writers thought that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was not for the multitude, because none but learned men could attain to it. <q>Philosophy,</q> says Cicero,  <q>is contented with a few judges, of its own accord designedly avoiding the multitude.</q> It is not therefore wisdom, if it avoids the concourse of men; since, if wisdom is given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it is given to all without any distinction, so that there is no one at all who cannot acquire it. But they so embrace <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is given to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, that they alone of all appear to wish to enjoy that which is a public good; being as <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> as if they should wish to bind or tear out the eyes of others that they may not see the sun. For what else is it to deny wisdom to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, than to take away from their minds the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and divine light? But if the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man is capable of wisdom, it was befitting that both workmen, and country people, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and all, in short, who bear the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, should be taught to be wise; and that the people should be brought together from every language, and condition, and sex, and age. Therefore it is a very strong argument that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> neither tends to wisdom, nor is of itself wisdom, that its <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is only made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the beard and cloak of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>.  The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, moreover, perceived this, who said that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was to be studied both by slaves and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> also, who invites those who are altogether unacquainted with letters to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> also, who wished to compose a state of wise men.</p>

<p>They attempted, indeed, to do that which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> required; but they were unable to proceed beyond words. First, because instruction in many arts is necessary for an application to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Common learning must be acquired on account of practice in reading, because in so great a variety of subjects it is impossible that all things should be learned by hearing, or retained in the memory. No little attention also must be given to the grammarians, in order that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the right method of speaking. That must occupy many years. Nor must there be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of rhetoric, that you may be able to utter and express the things which you have learned. Geometry also, and music, and astronomy, are necessary, because these arts have some connection with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; and the whole of these subjects cannot be learned by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who must learn within the years of their maturity the duties which are hereafter about to be of service to them for domestic uses; nor by servants, who must live in service during those years especially in which they are able to learn; nor by the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, or labourers, or rustics, who have to gain their daily support by labour. And on this account Tully says that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is averse from the multitude. But yet <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> will receive the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.  How, then, will they understand those things which are said respecting the first principles of things, the perplexities and intricacies of which are scarcely attained to by men of cultivated minds?</p>

<p>Therefore, in subjects which are involved in obscurity, and confused by a variety of intellects, and set off by the studied language of eloquent men, what place is there for the unskilful and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>? Lastly, they never taught any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to study <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, except Themiste  only, within the whole memory of man; nor slaves, except Ph&aelig;do  only, who is said, when living in oppressive slavery, to have been ransomed and taught by Cebes. They also enumerate <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Diogenes: these, however, were not slaves, though they had fallen into servitude, for they had been taken captive. A certain Aniceris is said to have ransomed <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> for eight sesterces. And on this account Seneca severely rebuked the ransomer himself, because he set so small value upon <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. He was a madman, as it seems to me, who was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with a man because he did not throw away much money; doubtless he ought to have weighed gold as though to ransom the corpse of Hector, or to have insisted upon the payment of more money than the seller demanded. Moreover, they taught none of the barbarians, with the single exception of Anacharsis the Scythian, who never would have dreamed of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> had he not previously learned both language and literature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. It is Divine Instruction Only Which Bestows Wisdom; And of What Efficacy the Law of God is.</h2>

<p>That, therefore, which they perceived to be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> required by the demands of nature, but which they were themselves unable to perform, and saw that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> could not effect, is accomplished only by divine instruction; for that only is wisdom. Doubtless they were able to persuade any one who do not even persuade themselves of anything; or they will crush the desires, moderate the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and restrain the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of any one, when they themselves both yield to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and acknowledge that they are overpowered by nature. But what influence is exerted on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men by the precepts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because of their simplicity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is shown by daily <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. Give me a man who is passionate, scurrilous, and unrestrained; with a very few words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</p> <blockquote><p><q>I will render him as gentle as a sheep.</q> </p></blockquote><p>Give me one who is grasping, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, and tenacious; I will presently restore him to you liberal, and freely bestowing his money with full hands. Give me a man who is afraid of pain and death; he shall presently despise crosses, and fires, and the bull of Phalaris.  Give me one who is lustful, an adulterer, a <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a>; you shall presently see him sober, chaste, and temperate. Give me one who is cruel and bloodthirsty: that fury shall presently be changed into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> clemency. Give me a man who is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, foolish, an evil-doer; immediately he shall be just, and wise, and innocent: for by one laver  all his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> shall be taken away. So great is the power of divine wisdom, that, when infused into the breast of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by one impulse it once for all expels folly, which is the mother of faults, for the effecting of which there is no need of payment, or books, or nightly studies. These results are accomplished gratuitously, easily, and quickly, if only the ears are open and the breast thirsts for wisdom. Let no one <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: we do not sell water, nor offer the sun for a reward. The fountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, most abundant and most full, is open to all; and this heavenly light rises for all,  as many as have eyes. Did any of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> effect these things, or is he able to effect them if he wishes? For though they spend their lives in the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, they are neither able to improve any other person nor themselves (if nature has presented any obstacle). Therefore their wisdom, doing its utmost, does not eradicate, but hide <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. But a few precepts of God so entirely change the whole man, and having put off the old man, render him new, that you would not recognise him as the same.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. How Little the Precepts of Philosophers Contribute to True Wisdom, Which You Will Find in Religion Only.</h2>

<p>What, then? Do they enjoin nothing similar? Yes, indeed, many things; and they frequently approach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But those precepts have no weight, because they are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and are without a greater, that is, that divine authority. No one therefore believes them, because the hearer imagines himself to be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, just as he is, who enjoins them. Moreover, there is no certainty with them, nothing which proceeds from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But since all things are done by conjecture, and many differing and various things are brought forward, it is the part of a most foolish man to be willing to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> their precepts, since it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether they are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or false; and therefore no one obeys them, because no one wishes to labour for an uncertainty. The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> say that it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which can alone produce a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life. Nothing can be said with greater <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But what if he shall be tormented, or afflicted with pain? Will it be possible for any one to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in the hands of the executioners? But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> pain inflicted upon the body is the material of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; therefore he is not wretched even in tortures. <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> speaks much more strongly. The wise man, he says, is always <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; and even when shut up in the bull of Phalaris he will utter this speech: <q>It is pleasant, and I do not care for it.</q> Who would not laugh at him? Especially, because a man who is devoted to pleasure took upon himself the character of a man of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and that to an immoderate degree; for it is impossible that any one should esteem tortures of the body as pleasures, since it is sufficient for discharging the office of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that one sustains and endures them. What do you, <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, say? What do you, <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>? The wise man is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> even when be is tortured. If it is on account of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his endurance, he will not enjoy it, for perchance he will die under the tortures. If it is on account of the recollection of the deed, either he will not perceive it if <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> shall perish, or, if he shall perceive it, he will gain nothing from it.</p>

<p>What other advantage is there then in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>? What <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of life? Is it that a man may die with equanimity? You present to me the advantage of a single hour, or perhaps moment, for the sake of which it may not be expedient to be worn out by miseries and labours throughout the whole of life. But how much time does death occupy? On the arrival of which it now makes no difference whether you shall have undergone it with equanimity or not. Thus it happens that nothing is sought from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But this is either superfluous and short-lived, or it will not follow from the depraved judgments of men. Therefore there is no fruit from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> where <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is subject to death and decay. Therefore they who said these things saw a certain shadow  of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; they did not see <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself. For they had their eyes fixed on the earth, nor did they raise their countenances on high that they might behold her</p> <blockquote><p><q>Who showed herself from the quarters of heaven.</q> </p></blockquote><p>This is the reason why no one obeys their precepts; inasmuch as they either train men to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, if they defend pleasure; or if they uphold <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, they neither threaten <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with any punishment, except that of disgrace only, nor do they promise any reward to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, except that of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and praise only, since they say that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is to be sought for its own sake, and not on account of any other object. The wise man therefore is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> under tortures; but when he suffers torture on account of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, on account of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that endurance of pain will render him most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. For it is God alone who can <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the reward of which is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> alone. And they who do not seek this, nor possess religion, with which <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life is connected, assuredly do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the power of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the reward of which they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; nor look towards heaven, as they themselves <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they do, when they inquire into subjects which do not admit of investigation, since there is no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for looking towards heaven, unless it be either to undertake religion, or to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that one's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. For if any one understands that God is to be worshipped, or has the hope of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> set before him, his mind  is in heaven; and although he may not behold it with his eyes, yet he does behold it with the eye of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But they who do not take up religion are of the earth, for religion is from heaven; and they who think that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> perishes together with the body, equally look down towards the earth: for beyond the body, which is earth, they see nothing further, which is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. It is therefore of no profit that man is so made, that with upright body he looks towards heaven, unless with mind raised aloft he discerns <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and his thoughts are altogether engaged upon the hope of everlasting life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28. Of True Religion and of Nature. Whether Fortune is a Goddess, and of Philosophy.</h2>

<p>Wherefore there is nothing else in life on which our plan and condition can depend but the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God who created us, and the religious and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> worship of Him; and since the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have wandered from this, it is plain that they were not wise. They sought wisdom, indeed; but because they did not seek it in a right manner, they sunk down to a greater distance, and fell into such great <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, that they did not even possess common wisdom. For they were not only unwilling to maintain religion, but they even took it away; while, led on by the appearance of false <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, they endeavour to free the mind from all <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: and this overturning of religion gains the name of nature. For they, either being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> by whom the world was made, or wishing to persuade men that nothing was completed by divine intelligence, said that nature was the mother of all things, as though they should say that all things were produced of their own accord: by which word they altogether confess their own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For nature, apart from <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> and power, is absolutely nothing. But if they call God nature, what perverseness is it, to use the name of nature rather than of God!  But if nature is the plan, or necessity, or condition of birth, it is not by itself capable of sensation; but there must necessarily be a divine <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which by its foresight furnishes the beginning of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to all things. Or if nature is heaven and earth, and everything which is created, nature is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>By a similar <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of fortune, as a goddess mocking the affairs of then with various casualties, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not from what source things good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> happen to them. They think that they are brought together to do battle with her; nor do they assign any reason by whom and on what account they are thus matched; but they only boast that they are every moment carrying on a contest for life and death with fortune. Now, as many as have consoled any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> on account of the death and removal of friends, have censured the name of fortune with the most severe accusations; nor is there any disputation of theirs on the subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in which fortune is not harassed. M. Tullius, in his <em>Consolation</em>, says that he has always fought against fortune, and that she was always overpowered by him when he had valiantly beaten back the attacks of his enemies; that he was not subdued by her even then, when he was driven from his home and deprived of his country; but then, when he lost his dearest daughter, he shamefully confesses that he is overcome by fortune. I yield, he says, and raise my hand.  What is more wretched than this man, who thus lies prostrate? He acts foolishly, he says; but it is one who professes that he is wise. What, then, does the assumption of the name imply? What that contempt of things which is laid claim to with magnificent words? What that dress, so different from others? Or why do you give precepts of wisdom at all, if no one has yet been found who is wise? And does any one bear ill-will to us because we deny that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are wise, when they themselves confess that they neither have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> nor wisdom? For if at any time they have so failed that they are not even able to feign anything, as their practice is in other cases, then in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they are reminded of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; and, as though in <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, they spring up and exclaim that they are blind and foolish. Anaxagoras pronounces that all things are overspread with darkness. Empedocles complains that the paths of the senses are narrow, as though for his reflections he had need of a chariot and four horses. Democritus says that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> lies sunk in a well so deep that it has no bottom; foolishly, indeed, as he says other things. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not, as it were, sunk in a well to which it was permitted him to descend, or even to fall, but, as it were, placed on the highest top of a lofty mountain, or in heaven, which is most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For what reason is there why he should say that it is sunk below rather than that it is raised aloft? Unless by chance he preferred to place the mind also in the feet, or in the bottom of the heels, rather than in the breast or in the head.</p>

<p>So widely removed were they from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, that even the posture of their own body did not admonish them, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must be sought for by them in the highest place.  From this despair arose that confession of Socrates, in which he said that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing but this one thing alone, that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing. From this flowed the system of the Academy, if that is to be called a system in which <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is both learned and taught. But not even those who claimed for themselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> were able consistently to defend that very thing which they thought that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. For since they were not in agreement  with one another, through their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of divine things they were so inconsistent and uncertain, and often asserting things contrary to one another, that you are unable to determine and decide what their meaning was. Why therefore should you fight against those men who perish by their own sword? Why should you labour to refute those whom their own speech refutes and presses?  Aristotle, says Cicero, accusing the ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, declares that they are either most foolish or most vainglorious, since they thought that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was perfected by their talents; but that he saw, because a great addition had been made in a few years, that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> would be complete in a short time. What, then, was that time? In what manner, when, or by whom, was <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> completed? For that which he said, that they were most foolish in supposing that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was made perfect by their talents, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but he did not even himself speak with sufficient discretion, who thought that it had either been begun by the ancients, or increased by those who were more recent, or that it would shortly be brought to perfection by those of later times. For that can never be investigated which is not sought by its own way.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29. Of Fortune Again, and Virtue.</h2>

<p>But let us return to the subject which we laid aside. Fortune, therefore, by itself, is nothing; nor must we so regard it as though it had any perception, since fortune is the sudden and unexpected occurrence of accidents. But <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, that they may not sometimes fail to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, wish to be wise in a foolish matter; and say that she is not a goddess, as is generally <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but a god. Sometimes, however, they call this god nature, sometimes fortune, <q>because he brings about,</q> says the same Cicero, <q>many things unexpected by us, on account of our want of intelligence and our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of causes.</q> Since, therefore, they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the causes on account of which anything is done, they must also be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of him who does them. The same writer, in a work of great seriousness, in which he was giving to his son precepts of life drawn from <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, says, <q>Who can be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the power of fortune is great on either side? For both when we meet with a prosperous breeze from her we gain the issues which we desire, and when she has breathed contrary to us we are dashed on the rocks.</q>  First of all, he who says that nothing can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, spoke this as though he himself and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Then he who endeavours to render doubtful even the things which are plain, thought that this was plain, which ought to have been to him especially doubtful; for to a wise man it is altogether false. Who, he says, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not? I indeed <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. Let him teach me, if he can, what that power is, what that breeze, and what the contrary breath.</p>

<p>It is disgraceful, therefore, for a man of talent to say that, which if you were to deny it, he would be unable to prove. Lastly, he who says that the assent must be withheld because it is the part of a foolish man rashly to assent to things which are unknown to him, he, I say, altogether <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the opinions of the vulgar and uninstructed, who think that it is fortune which gives to men good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. For they represent her image with the horn of plenty and with a rudder, as though she both gave <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and had the government of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. And to this opinion Virgil  assented, who calls fortune <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>; and the historian  who says, But assuredly fortune bears sway in everything. What place, then, remains for the other gods? Why is she not said to reign by herself, if she has more power than others; or why is she not alone worshipped, if she has power in all things? Or if she inflicts <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> only, let them bring forward some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why, if she is a goddess, she envies men, and desires their destruction, though she is religiously worshipped by them; why she is more favourable to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and more unfavourable to the good; why she plots, afflicts, deceives, exterminates; who appointed her as the perpetual harasser of the race of men; why, in short, she has obtained so mischievous a power, that she renders all things illustrious or obscure according to her caprice rather than in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Philosophers, I say, ought rather to have inquired into these things, than rashly to have accused fortune, who is innocent: for although she has some <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, yet no reason can be brought forward by them why she should be as hostile to men as she is supposed to be. Therefore all those speeches in which they rail at the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of fortune, and in opposition to fortune arrogantly boast of their own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, are nothing else but the ravings of thoughtless levity.</p>

<p>Wherefore let them not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> us, to whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has revealed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: who, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that fortune is nothing, so also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and crafty spirit who is unfriendly to the good, and the enemy of righteousness, who acts in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of whose enmity we have explained in the second book.  He therefore lays plots against all; but those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God he hinders by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, he overwhelms with folly, he overspreads with darkness, that no one may be able to attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the divine name, in which alone are contained both wisdom and everlasting life. Those, on the other hand, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he assails with wiles and craft, that he may ensnare them with desire and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and when they are corrupted by the blandishments of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, may impel them to death; or, if he shall have not succeeded by stratagem, he attempts to cast them down by force and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. For on this account he was not at once thrust down by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to punishment at the original transgression, that by his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> he may exercise man to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for unless this is in constant agitation, unless it is strengthened by continual harassing, it cannot be perfect, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is dauntless and unconquered patience in enduring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. From which it comes to pass that there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> if an adversary is wanting. When, therefore, they perceived the force of this perverse power opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of its name, they invented for themselves the senseless name of fortune; and how far this is removed from wisdom, Juvenal declares in these verses: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>No divine power is absent if there is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; but we make you a goddess, O Fortune, and place you in heaven.</q></p></blockquote><p>It was folly, therefore, and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and blindness, and, as Cicero says,  <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of facts and causes, which introduced the names of Nature and Fortune. But as they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of their adversary, so also they do not indeed <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which is derived from the idea of an adversary. And if this is joined with wisdom, or, as they say, is itself also wisdom, they must be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> in what subjects it is contained. For no one can possibly be furnished with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> arms if he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the enemy against whom he must be armed; nor can he overcome his adversary, who in fighting does not attack his real enemy, but a shadow. For he will be overthrown, who, having his attention fixed on another object, shall not previously have foreseen or guarded against the blow aimed at his vitals.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30. The Conclusion of the Things Before Spoken; And by What Means We Must Pass from the Vanity of the Philosophers to True Wisdom, and the Knowledge of the True God, in Which Alone are Virtue and Happiness.</h2>

<p>I have taught, as far as my <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> talents permitted, that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> held a course widely deviating from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. I perceive, however, how many things I have omitted, because it was not my province to enter into a disputation against <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. But it was necessary for me to make a digression to this subject, that I might show that so many and great intellects have expended themselves in vain on false subjects, lest any one by chance being shut out by corrupt <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>, should wish to betake himself to them as though about to find some certainty. Therefore the only hope, the only safety for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is placed in this doctrine, which we defend. All the wisdom of man consists in this alone, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and worship of God: this is our tenet, this our opinion. Therefore with all the power of my voice I testify, I proclaim, I declare: Here, here is that which all <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have sought throughout their whole life; and yet, they have not been able to investigate, to grasp, and to attain to it, because they either retained a religion which was corrupt, or took it away altogether. Let them therefore all depart, who do not instruct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, but throw it into confusion. For what do they teach? Or whom do they instruct, who have not yet instructed themselves? Whom are the sick able to heal, whom can the blind guide? Let us all, therefore, who have any regard for wisdom, betake ourselves to this subject. Or shall we wait until Socrates <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> something? Or Anaxagoras finds light in the darkness? Or until Democritus draws forth <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the well? Or Empedocles extends the paths of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Or until Arcesilas and Carneades see, and feel, and perceive?</p>

<p>Lo, a voice from heaven teaching the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and displaying to us a light brighter than the sun itself.  Why are we <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to ourselves, and delay to take up wisdom, which learned men, though they wasted their lives in its pursuit, were never able to discover. Let him who wishes to be wise and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> hear the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, learn righteousness, understand the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of his birth, despise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, embrace divine things, that he may gain that chief good to which he was born. Having overthrown all false <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a>, and having refuted all the arguments, as many as it was customary or possible to bring forward in their defence; then, having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the systems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to be false, we must now come to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion and wisdom, since, as I shall teach, they are both connected together; that we may maintain it either by arguments, or by examples, or by competent witnesses, and may show that the folly with which those worshippers of gods do not cease to upbraid us, has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> with us, but lies altogether with them. And although, in the former books, when I was contending against false <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a>, and in this, when I was overthrowing false wisdom, I showed where the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, yet the next book will more plainly indicate what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion and what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom.</p>
