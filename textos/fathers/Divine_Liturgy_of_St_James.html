<p> <em>The Priest. </em></p>

<p>I O <span class="sc">Sovereign</span> Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, contemn me not, defiled with a multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: for, behold, I have come to this Your divine and heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, not as being worthy; but looking only to Your goodness, I direct my voice to You: God be merciful to me, a sinner; I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and before You, and am unworthy to come into the presence of this Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and spiritual table, upon which Your only-begotten Son, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> set forth as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for me, a sinner, and stained with every spot. Wherefore I present to You this supplication and thanksgiving, that Your Spirit the Comforter may be sent down upon me, strengthening and fitting me for this service; and count me worthy to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> without condemnation the word, delivered from You by me to the people, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, with whom You are blessed, together with Your all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and good, and quickening, and consubstantial  Spirit, now and ever, and to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Prayer of the standing beside the altar.</em></p>

<p>II Glory to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the triune light of the Godhead, which is unity subsisting in trinity, divided, yet indivisible: for the Trinity is the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> Almighty, whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> the heavens declare, and the earth His dominion, and the sea His might, and every sentient and intellectual creature at all times proclaims His majesty: for all <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> becomes Him, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and might, greatness and magnificence, now and ever, and to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>III Sovereign Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, O <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who freely offered Yourself a blameless <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> upon the cross to God even the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the coal of double nature, that touched the lips of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> with the tongs, and took away his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, touch also the hearts of us sinners, and purify us from every stain, and present us <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> beside Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar, that we may offer You a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise: and accept from us, Your unprofitable servants, this <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> as an odour of a sweet smell, and make fragrant the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> odour of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and purify us with the sanctifying power of Your all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit: for You alone are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, who sanctifies, and are communicated to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> becomes You, with Your <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Father, and Your all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and good, and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>IV O beneficent King <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, receive Your Church, coming unto You through Your Christ: fulfil to each what is profitable; lead all to perfection, and make us perfectly worthy of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Your sanctification, gathering us together within Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, which You have purchased by the precious blood of Your only-begotten Son, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a>, with whom You are blessed and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, together with Your all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and good, and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p> <em>The Deacon.</em></p>

<p>V Let us again <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> at the entrance of the congregation.</em></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who accepted the gifts of Abel, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and of Abram, the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and of Zacharias, accept also from the hand of us sinners this <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> for an odour of a sweet smell, and for remission of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and those of all Your people; for blessed are You, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> becomes You, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, now and ever.</p>

<p> <em>The Deacon.</em></p>

<p>Sir, pronounce the blessing. </p>

<p> <em>The Priest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>.</em></p>

<p>Our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who through exceeding goodness and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not to be restrained was crucified, and did not refuse to be pierced by the spear and nails; who provided this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> and awful service as an everlasting memorial for us perpetually: bless Your ministry in Christ the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and bless our entrance, and fully complete the presentation of this our service by Your unutterable compassion, now and ever, and to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p> <em>The responsive <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> from the Deacon.</em></p>

<p>VI. The Lord bless us, and make us worthy seraphically to offer gifts, and to sing the oft-sung hymn of the divine Trisagion, by the fullness and exceeding abundance of all the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, now and ever.</p>

<p> <em>Then the Deacon begins to sing in the entrance. </em></p>

<p>You who art the only-begotten Son and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; who submitted for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to become flesh of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> God-mother,  and ever-virgin Mary; who immutably became man and was crucified, O Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by Your death trod death underfoot; who art one of the Holy Trinity <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> together with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, save us.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest says this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> from the gates to the altar.</em></p>

<p>VII God Almighty, Lord great in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, who hast given to us an entrance into the Holy of Holies, through the sojourning among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Your only-begotten Son, our Lord, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, we supplicate and invoke Your goodness, since we are fearful and trembling when about to stand at Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar; send forth upon us, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your good <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and sanctify our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and bodies, and spirits, and turn our thoughts to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, in order that with a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> we may bring unto You gifts, offerings, and fruits for the remission of our transgressions, and for the propitiation of all Your people, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercies and loving-kindness of Your only-begotten Son, with whom You are blessed to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p> <em>After the approach to the altar, the Priest says:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>VIII. Peace be to all.</p>

<p> <em>The People.</em></p>

<p>And to your spirit.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest.</em></p>

<p>The Lord bless us all, and sanctify us for the entrance and celebration of the divine and pure <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, giving rest to the blessed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> among the good and just, by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and loving-kindness, now and ever, and to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Then the Deacon says the bidding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. </em></p>

<p>IX. In peace let us beseech the Lord.</p>

<p>For the peace that is from above, and for God's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, let us beseech the Lord.</p>

<p>For the peace of the whole world, for the unity of all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us beseech the Lord.</p>

<p>For the remission of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and forgiveness of our transgressions, and for our deliverance from all tribulation, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, danger, and distress, and from the uprising of our enemies, let us beseech the Lord.</p>

<p> <em>Then the Singers sing the Trisagion Hymn.</em></p>

<p>Holy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mighty, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, have mercy upon us.</p>

<p> <em>Then the Priest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, bowing.</em></p>

<p>X. O compassionate and merciful, long-suffering, and very gracious and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, look from Your prepared dwelling-place, and hear us Your suppliants, and deliver us from every <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and of man; withhold not Your aid from us, nor bring on us chastisements too heavy for our strength: for we are unable to overcome what is opposed to us; but You are able, Lord, to save us from everything that is against us. Save us, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the difficulties of this world, according to Your goodness, in order that, having drawn near with a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar, we may send up to You without condemnation the blessed hymn Trisagion, together with the heavenly powers, and that, having performed the service, well pleasing to You and divine, we may be counted worthy of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<p> <em>(Aloud.)</em></p>

<p>Because You are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and dwell and abide in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, we send up the praise and the hymn Trisagion to You, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, now and ever, and to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. </p>

<p> <em>The People.</em></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest.</em></p>

<p>XI. Peace be to all.</p>

<p> <em>The People.</em></p>

<p>And to your spirit.</p>

<p> <em>The Singers.</em></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>.</p>

<p><span style="italic">Then there are read in order</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oracles of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is set forth, and His sufferings and resurrection from the dead, His ascension into heaven, and His second appearing with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and this takes place daily in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and divine service.</span> </p>

<p> <em>After the reading and instruction the Deacon says:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>XII. Let us all say, Lord, be merciful. </p>

<p>For the people standing round, and waiting for the rich and plenteous mercy that is from You;</p>

<p>We beseech You, be merciful and gracious.</p>

<p>Save Your people, O Lord, and bless Your inheritance.</p>

<p>Visit Your world in mercy and compassion.</p>

<p>Exalt the horn of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by the power of the precious and quickening cross.</p>

<p>We beseech You, most merciful Lord, hear us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to You, and have mercy upon us.</p>

<p> <em>The People (thrice).</em></p>

<p>Lord, have mercy upon us.</p>

<p> <em>The Deacon.</em></p>

<p>XIII. For the remission of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and forgiveness of our transgressions, and for our deliverance from all tribulation, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, danger, and distress, let us beseech the Lord.</p>

<p>Let us all entreat from the Lord, that we may pass the whole day, perfect, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, peaceful, and without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>Let us entreat from the Lord a messenger of peace, a faithful guide, a guardian of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and bodies.</p>

<p>Let us entreat from the Lord forgiveness and remission of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and transgressions.</p>

<p>Let us entreat that the close of our lives may be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, without pain and without shame, and a good plea at the dread and awful judgment-seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest.</em></p>

<p>XIV. For You are the gospel and the light, Saviour and keeper of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and bodies, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Your only-begotten Son, and Your all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit, now and ever.</p>

<p>Let us offer supplication to God the Lord.</p>

<p> <em>The People.</em></p>

<p> <em>(Thrice.)</em></p>

<p>Lord, You will open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Your praise.</p>

<p> <em>(Thrice.)</em></p>

<p>Let my mouth be filled with Your praise, O Lord, that I may tell of Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, of Your majesty, all the day.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you.  </p>

<p> <em>Then the Priest, at great length:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>O Sovereign Lord, who hast visited us in compassion and mercies, and hast freely given to us, Your <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and sinful and unworthy servants, boldness to stand at Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar, and to offer to You this dread and bloodless <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and for the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the people, look upon me Your unprofitable servant, and blot out my transgressions for Your compassion's sake; and purify my lips and heart from all pollution of flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>; and remove from me every shameful and foolish thought, and fit me by the power of Your all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit for this service; and receive me graciously by Your goodness as I draw near to Your altar.</p>

<p>And be pleased, O Lord, that these gifts brought by our hands may be acceptable, stooping to my weakness; and cast me not away from Your presence, and abhor not my unworthiness; but pity me according to Your great mercy, and according to the multitude of Your mercies pass by my transgressions, that, having come before Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> without condemnation, I may be counted worthy of the protection of Your only-begotten Son, and of the illumination of Your all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit, that I may not be as a slave of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cast out, but as Your servant may find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy and forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> before You, both in the world that now is and in that which is to come.</p>

<p>I beseech You, Almighty Sovereign, all-powerful Lord, hear my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; for You are He who work all in all, and we all seek in all things the help and succour that come from You and Your only-begotten Son, and the good and quickening and consubstantial Spirit, now and ever.</p>

<p>XXV. O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who through Your great and unspeakable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> sent forth Your only-begotten Son into the world, in order that He might turn back the lost sheep, turn not away us sinners, laying hold of You by this dread and bloodless <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; for we trust not in our own righteousness, but in Your good mercy, by which You purchase our race.</p>

<p>We entreat and beseech Your goodness that it may not be for condemnation to Your people that this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> has been administered by us, but for remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for renewal of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and bodies, for the well-pleasing of You, God and Father, in the mercy and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Your only-begotten Son, with whom You are blessed, together with Your all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and good and quickening Spirit, now and always, and for ever. </p>

<p>XXVI. O Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who created us, and bring us into life, who hast shown to us ways to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, who hast granted to us a revelation of heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and hast appointed us to this ministry in the power of Your all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit, grant, O Sovereign, that we may become servants of Your new testament, ministers of Your pure <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and receive us as we draw near to Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar, according to the greatness of Your mercy, that we may become worthy of offering to You gifts and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for our transgressions and for those of the people; and grant to us, O Lord, with all <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to offer to You this spiritual and bloodless <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and graciously receiving it unto Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and spiritual altar above the skies for an odour of a sweet spiritual smell, send down in answer on us the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Your all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit.</p>

<p>And, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, look upon us, and have regard to this our reasonable service, and accept it, as You accepted the gifts of Abel, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> offices of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, the peace-offerings of Samuel, the repentance of David, the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of Zacharias. As You accepted from the hand of Your <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> service, so accept also in Your goodness from the hands of us sinners these offered gifts; and grant that our offering may be acceptable, sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as a propitiation  for our transgressions and the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the people; and for the rest of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>  that have fallen asleep aforetime; that we also, Your <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, sinful, and unworthy servants, being counted worthy without guile to serve Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar, may receive the reward of faithful and wise stewards, and may find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy in the terrible day of Your just and good retribution.</p>

<p> <em>Prayer of the veil. </em></p>

<p>XXVII. We thank You, O Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that You have given us boldness for the entrance of Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, which You have renewed to us as a new and living way through the veil of the flesh  of Your Christ. We therefore, being counted worthy to enter into the place of the tabernacle of Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and to be within the veil, and to behold the Holy of Holies, cast ourselves down before Your goodness:</p>

<p>Lord, have mercy on us: since we are full of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling, when about to stand at Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar, and to offer this dread and bloodless <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for our own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and for the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the people:  send forth, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your good <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and sanctify our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and bodies, and spirits; and turn our thoughts to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, that with a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> we may bring to You a peace-offering, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise:</p>

<p> <em>(Aloud.)</em></p>

<p>By the mercy and loving-kindness of Your only-begotten Son, with whom You are blessed, together with Your all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and good, and quickening Spirit, now and always:</p>

<p> <em>The People.</em></p>

<p>Let us stand reverently, let us stand in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with contrition: let us attend to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> communion service, to offer peace to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p> <em>The People.</em></p>

<p>The offering of peace, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest [A veil is now withdrawn from the oblation of bread and wine.]</em></p>

<p>And reveal it clearly to us, uncovering the veils that darkly invest in <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>  this sacred ceremonial. Fill our intellectual vision with absolute light, and having purified our poverty from every pollution of flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, make it worthy of this dread and awful approach: for You are an all-merciful and gracious <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we send up the praise and the thanksgiving to You, Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, now, and always, and for ever.</p>
