<p>O Sovereign Lord Christ Jesus, the co-eternal Word of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Father, who was made in all things like as we are, but without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of our race; who hast sent forth Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to proclaim and teach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Your kingdom, and to heal all disease, all sickness among Your people, be pleased now, O Lord, to send forth Your light and Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p> <em>(Aloud.)</em></p>

<p>Let Your mercy speedily overtake us, O Lord. For You are the bringer of good tidings, the Saviour and Guardian of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and bodies; and we offer <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, thanks, and the <em>Trisagion</em> to You, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, now, henceforth, and for evermore.</p>

<p>May all our brethren who have gone or who are about to go abroad, safely reach their destination in due season.</p>

<p>Send down the gracious rain upon the thirsty lands, and make the rivers  flow in full stream, according to Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>You have said through Your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah,&mdash; I will defend this city, to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</p>

<p>Wherefore we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and beseech You to defend in Your good mercy this city, for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> Mark, who has shown us the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, mercy, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Your only-begotten Son.</p>

<p> <em>Then they sing the Cherubic hymn. </em></p>

<p> <em>X. The Priest offers <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> at the entrance,  and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>O Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who lackest nothing, accept this <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> offered by an unworthy hand, and deem us all worthy of Your blessing, for You are our sanctification, and we ascribe <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to You.</p>

<p> <em>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things are carried to the altar, and the Priest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> thus:&mdash; </em></p>

<p> <em>The Deacon.</em></p>

<p>XI. Salute one another.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest says the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of salutation.</em></p>

<p>O Sovereign and Almighty Lord, look down from heaven on Your Church, on all Your people, and on all Your flock. Save us all, Your unworthy servants, the sheep of Your fold. Give us Your peace, Your help, and Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and send to us the gift of Your <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that with a pure heart and a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> we may salute one another with an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, without hypocrisy, and with no hostile purpose, but guileless and pure in one spirit, in the bond of peace and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, one body and one spirit, in one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even as we have been called in one hope of our calling, that we may all meet in the divine and boundless <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, with whom You are blessed.</p>

<p> <em>Then the Priest offers the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and says:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> is offered to Your name. Let it ascend, we implore You, from the hands of Your poor and sinful servants to Your heavenly altar for a sweet-smelling savour, and the propitiation of all Your people. For all <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, adoration, and thanks are due unto You, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, now, henceforth, and for evermore. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p> <em>After the Salutation,  the Deacon in a loud voice says:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>XII. Stand and make the offering duly. </p>

<p> <em>The Priest, making the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> over the disks and chalices, says in a loud voice (the Nicene Creed):&mdash; </em></p>

<p> <em>The Priest.</em></p>

<p>Peace be to all.</p>

<p> <em>The Deacon.</em></p>

<p>Pray for those who present the offering.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest says the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the Oblation. </em></p>

<p>O Sovereign Lord, Christ Jesus the Word, who art equal in power with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the great <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>; the bread that came down from heaven, and saved our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from ruin; who gavest Yourself, a spotless Lamb, for the life of the world....</p>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and beseech You, O Lord, in Your mercy, to let Your presence rest upon this bread and these chalices  on the all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> table, while <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, archangels, and Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> stand round and minister for Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the renewing of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, mercy, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Your only-begotten Son, through whom and with whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power to You.</p>

<p> <em>And when the People say</em>,</p>

<p>And from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was He made flesh;</p>

<p> <em>The Priest makes the sign of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>,  and says:&mdash; </em></p>

<p> <em>The People.</em></p>

<p>It is meet and right. </p>

<p> <em>The Priest begins the Anaphoral <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</em></p>

<p>O Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Sovereign and Almighty Father, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> it is meet and right, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and becoming, and good for our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, to praise, bless, and thank You; to make open confession to You by day and night with voice, lips, and heart without ceasing;</p>

<p>To You who hast made the heaven, and all that is therein; the earth, and all that is therein; The sea, fountains, rivers, lakes, and all that is therein;</p>

<p>To You who, after Your own image and likeness, has made man, upon whom You also bestowed the joys of Paradise;</p>

<p>And when he trespassed against You, You neither neglected nor forsook him, good Lord,</p>

<p>But recalled him by Your law, instruct him by Your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, restore and renew him by this awful, life-giving, and heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.</p>

<p>And all this You have done by Your Wisdom and the Light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Your only-begotten Son, our Lord, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Through whom, thanking You with Him and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,</p>

<p>We offer this reasonable and bloodless <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, which all nations, from the rising to the setting of the sun, from the north and the south, present to You, O Lord; for great is Your name among all peoples, and in all places are <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and oblation offered to Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name. </p>

<p>XIV. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and beseech You, <span style="italic">O lover of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, O good</span> Lord,  remember in Your good mercy the Holy and only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church throughout the whole world, and all Your people, and all the sheep of this fold.  Vouchsafe to the hearts of all of us the peace of heaven, but grant us also the peace of this life.</p>

<p>Guide and direct in all peace the king,  army, magistrates, councils,  peoples, and neighbourhoods, and all our outgoings and incomings.</p>

<p>O King of Peace, grant us Your peace in unity and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. May we be Yours, O Lord; for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no other God but You, and name no other name but Yours. Give life unto the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all of us, and let no deadly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> prevail against us, or against all Your people.</p>

<p>Look down in mercy and compassion, O Lord, and heal the sick among Your people. Deliver them and us, O Lord, from sickness and disease, and drive away the spirit of weakness.</p>

<p>Raise up those who have been long afflicted, and heal those who are vexed with unclean spirits.</p>

<p>Have mercy on all who are in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, or in mines, or on trial, or condemned, or in exile, or crushed by cruel bondage or tribute. Deliver them, O Lord, for You are our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who settest the captives free; who raisest up the downtrodden; who givest hope to the hopeless, and help to the helpless; who liftest up the fallen; who givest refuge to the shipwrecked, and vengeance to the oppressed.</p>

<p>Pity, relieve, and restore every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is afflicted or wandering.</p>

<p>But You, O Lord &mdash; the physician of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and bodies, the guardian of all flesh &mdash; look down, and by Your saving power heal all the diseases of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body.</p>

<p>Guide and prosper our brethren who have gone or who are about to go abroad. Whether they travel by land, or river, or lake, by public road, or in whatever way journeying, bring them everywhere to a safe and tranquil haven. Be pleased to be with them by land and sea, and restore them in health and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to joyful and healthful homes.</p>

<p>Ever defend, O Lord, our journey through this life from trouble and storm.</p>

<p>Send down rich and copious showers on the dry and thirsty lands.</p>

<p>Gladden and revive the face of the earth, that it may spring forth and rejoice in the raindrops.</p>

<p>Make the waters of the river flow in full stream.</p>

<p>Gladden and revive the face of the earth with the swelling waters.</p>

<p>Fill all the channels of the streams, and multiply the fruits of the earth.</p>

<p>Bless, O Lord, the fruits of the earth, and keep them safe and unharmed. Fill them with seed, and make them ripe for the harvest.</p>

<p>Bless even now, O Lord, Your yearly crown of blessing for the sake of the poor of Your people, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, the orphan, and the stranger, and for the sake of all of us who have our hope in You and call upon Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name; for the eyes of all are upon You, and You give them bread in due season.</p>

<p>O You who gives food to all flesh, fill our hearts with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, that at all times, having all sufficiency, we may abound to every good work in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>.</p>

<p>O King of kings and Lord of lords, defend the kingdom of Your servant, our <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and Christ-loving sovereign,  whom You have deemed worthy to reign over this land in peace, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</p>

<p>Subdue under him, O Lord, every enemy and adversary, whether at home or abroad. Gird on Your shield and armour, and rise to his aid. Draw Your sword, and help him to fight against them that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> him. Shield him in the day of battle, and grant that the fruit of his loins may sit upon his throne.</p>

<p>Be kind to him, O Lord, for the sake of Your Holy and Apostolic Church, and all Your Christ-loving people, that we too in his peaceful reign may live a calm and tranquil life, in all reverence and godliness.</p>

<p>O Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, give peace to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of our fathers and brethren who have fallen asleep in Jesus, remembering our forefathers of old, our fathers, patriarchs, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, confessors, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just men who have died in the Lord.</p>

<p>Especially remember those whose memory we this day <span style="italic">celebrate</span>, and our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> father Mark,  the apostle and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, who has shown us the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. </p>

<p> <em>The Deacon.</em></p>

<p>Lord, bless us.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest.</em></p>

<p>The Lord will bless you in His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, now, henceforth, and for evermore.</p>

<p> <em>The Deacon reads the record of the dead. </em></p>

<p> <em>The Priest bows and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>.</em></p>

<p>XV. Give peace, O Sovereign Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all who dwell in the tabernacles of Your <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Graciously bestow upon them in Your kingdom Your promised blessing, which eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man what You, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have prepared for those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name. Give peace to their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and deem them worthy of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. </p>

<p>Grant that we may end our lives as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, acceptable unto You and without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and be pleased to give us part and lot with all Your <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</p>

<p>Accept, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by Your ministering archangels at Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, heavenly, and reasonable altar in the spacious heavens, the thank-offerings of those who offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and oblation, and of those who desire to offer much or little, in secret or openly, but have it not to give.</p>

<p>Accept the thank-offerings of those who have presented them this day, as You accepted the gifts of Your righteous Abel:</p>

<p> <em>The Priest offers <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and says: &mdash; </em></p>

<p>As You accepted the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of Zacharias, the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of Cornelius, and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> two mites, accept also the thank-offerings of these, and give them for the things of time the things of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and for the things of earth the things of heaven. Defend, O Lord, our most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed <span style="font-style: italic;">Papas</span>  <span class="greek">&#x0394;</span>, whom You have fore-ordained to rule over Your Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church, and our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Bishop <span class="greek">&#x0394;</span>, that they through many years of peace may, according to Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed will, fulfil the sacred <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> committed to their care, and dispense aright the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> everywhere, the elders, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacons</a>, readers, singers, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>,  <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>.</p>

<p>Remember, O Lord, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city  of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; and the imperial city;  and this city of ours, and all cities and all lands, and the peace and safety of those who dwell therein in the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. </p>

<p>Be mindful, O Lord, of the return of the back-sliding, and of every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is afflicted and oppressed, and in need of Your divine mercy and help.</p>

<p>Be mindful, O Lord, of our brethren in captivity. Grant that they may find mercy and compassion with those who have led them captive.</p>

<p>Be mindful also of us, O Lord, Your sinful and unworthy servants, and blot out our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in Your goodness and mercy.</p>

<p>Be mindful also of me, Your lowly, sinful, and unworthy servant, and in Your mercy blot out my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Be with us, O Lord, who minister unto Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name.</p>

<p>Bless our meetings, O Lord.</p>

<p>Utterly uproot <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> from the world. </p>

<p>Crush under our feet <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and all his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> influence.</p>

<p>Humble now, as at all times, the enemies of Your Church.</p>

<p>Lay bare their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</p>

<p>Speedily show them their weakness.</p>

<p>Bring to naught the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> plots they contrive against us.</p>

<p>Arise, O Lord, and let Your enemies be scattered, and let all who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name be put to flight.</p>

<p>Bless a thousand times ten thousand Your faithful and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> people while they do Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> will.</p>

<p> <em>The Deacon.</em></p>

<p>Let those who are seated stand.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest says the following <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>Deliver the captive; rescue the distressed feed the hungry; comfort the faint-hearted, convert the erring; enlighten the darkened; raise the fallen; confirm the wavering; heal the sick; and guide them all, good Lord, into the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and into Your sacred fold. Deliver us from our iniquities; protect and defend us at all times.</p>

<p> <em>The Deacon.</em></p>

<p>Turn to the east.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest bows and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>.</em></p>

<p>For You are far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come. Round You stand ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and hosts of archangels; and Your two most honoured creatures, the many-eyed <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> and the six-winged seraphim. With two they cover their faces, and with two they cover their feet, and with two they fly; and they cry one to another for ever with the voice of praise, and glorify You, O Lord, singing aloud the triumphal and thrice-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>  hymn to Your great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>:&mdash; </p>
