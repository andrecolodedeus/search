<h1>Dubious Letters</h1>

<h2>The Doubtful Letters Of Sulpitius Severus.</h2>

<h2>Letter 1</h2>

<p class="subh">A Letter of the Holy Presbyter Severus to His Sister Claudia Concerning the Last Judgment.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>On reading your letters, my feelings were, in many ways, deeply moved, and I could not refrain from tears. For I both wept for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> because I could perceive from the very language of your letters, that you were living according to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, and out of my exceeding desire after you, I could not help lamenting that, without any fault on my part, I was parted from you; and I would have felt this still more strongly had you not sent me a letter. Should I not, then, enjoy the company of such a sister? But I call your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that I have very often wished to come to you, but have up till now been prevented, through the opposition of him  who is accustomed to hinder us. For, in my eager desire, I was both urgent to satisfy my wishes by seeing you; and we seemed, if we should meet, likely to accomplish more effectually the work of the Lord, since by comforting one another we should live with the heavy load of this world trodden under our feet. But I do not now fix the day or time of visiting you, because, as often as I have done so, I have not been able to fulfil my purpose. I shall wait on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord, and hope that, by my supplications and your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, he may bring it about that we reap some advantage from our perseverance. </p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

<p>But because you have desired from me in all my letters which I had sent to you precepts to nourish your life and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it has come to pass that, through the frequency of my writings to you, I have now exhausted language of that kind; and I can really write nothing new to you, so as to avoid what I have written before. And in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, through the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you do not now need to be exhorted, inasmuch as, perfecting your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at the very beginning of your saintly life, you display a devoted <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. One thing, however, I do press upon you, that you do not go back on things you have already passed away from, that you do not long again for things you have already scorned, and that, having put your hand to the plow, you do not look back <span class="stiki" id="note350141"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke&nbsp;9:62</a></span> again, retracing your steps; for, undoubtedly, by falling into this fault, your furrow will lose its straightness, and the cultivator will not receive his own proper reward. Moreover, he does not secure even a measure of the reward, if he has, in a measure, failed. For, as we must flee from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to righteousness, so he who has entered on the practice of righteousness must beware lest he lay himself open to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is written that <q>his righteousness shall not profit the righteous on the day on which he has gone astray.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350142"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse24">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:24</a></span> For this, then, we must take our stand, for this we must labor, that we, who have escaped from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, do not lose the prepared rewards. For the enemy stands ready against us, that he may at once strike the man who has been stripped of the shield of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Our shield, therefore, is not to be cast aside, lest our side be exposed to attack; and our sword is not to be put away, lest the enemy then begin to give up all <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: moreover, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that if he sees a man fully armed, he will retreat. Nor are we <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that it is a hard and difficult thing daily to fight against the flesh and the world. But if you reflect upon <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and if you consider the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, which undoubtedly the Lord will condescend to bestow upon us although we are sinners, what suffering, I ask, is sufficiently great, by which we may merit such things? And besides, our struggle in this world is but for a short time; for although death do not speedily overtake us, old age will come. The years flow on, and time glides by; while, as I hope, the Lord Jesus will speedily call us to himself, as being dear to his heart.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>O how <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> shall be that departure of ours, when Christ shall receive us into his own abode after we have been purged  from the stains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through the experience  of a better life! Martyrs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> will meet with us, <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> will join themselves to us, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will be glad, archangels will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, being conquered, will look pale, though still retaining his cruel countenance, inasmuch as he will lose all  advantage from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he had secured for himself in us. He will see <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> granted us through mercy, and merits <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. We shall triumph over our conquered foe. Where shall now the wise men of the world appear? Where shall the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man, where shall the adulterer, where shall the irreligious, where shall the drunkard, where shall the evil-speaker be recognized? What shall these wretched beings say in their own defense? <q>We did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you, Lord; we did not see that you were in the world: you did not send the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: you did not give the law to the world: we did not see the patriarchs: we did not read the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Your Christ never was upon the earth: Peter was silent: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> refused to preach: no Evangelist taught. There were no <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> whose example we should follow: no one predicted your future judgment: no one commanded us to clothe the poor: no one enjoined us to restrain <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: no one persuaded us to fight against <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: we fell through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what we did.</q></p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>Against these, from among the company of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, righteous <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> shall first proclaim, <q>I, Lord, predicted that a deluge was about to come on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and after the deluge I set an example to the good in my own person; since I did not perish with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> who perished, that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both what was the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the innocent, and what the punishment of sinners.</q> After him, faithful <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> will say in opposition to them, <q>I, Lord, about the mid-time  of the age of the world, laid the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in you; I was chosen as the father of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, that they might follow my example; I did not hesitate, Lord, to offer Isaac, while yet a youth, as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to you, that they might understand that there is nothing which ought not to be presented to the Lord, when they perceived that I did not spare even my only son: I left, Lord, my country, and my <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, at your command, that they also might have an example teaching them to leave the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the world and the age: I, Lord, was the first to recognize you, though under a corporeal  form, nor did I hesitate to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> who it was that I beheld, although you appeared to me in a different form from your own, that these might learn to judge, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.</q> Him the blessed <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> will support in his pleadings, saying: <q>I Lord, delivered the law to all these, at your command, that those whom a free  <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> did not influence, the spoken law at least might restrain: I said, 'You shall not <span class="stiki" id="note350149"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;20:14</a></span> commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>,' in order that I might prevent the licentiousness of fornication: I said, 'You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <span class="stiki" id="note350150"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus&nbsp;19:18</a></span> your neighbor,' that affection might abound; I said, 'You shall worship the Lord alone,' <span class="stiki" id="note350151"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:13</a></span> in order that these might not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, or allow temples to exist; I commanded that false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> should not be spoken, that I might shut the lips of these people against all <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. I set forth the things which had been done and said from the beginning of the world, through the working within me of the spirit of your power, that a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things past might convey to these people instruction about things to come. I predicted, O Lord Jesus, your coming, that it might not be an unexpected thing to these people, when they were called to acknowledge him whom I had before announced as about to come.</q> </p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>After him, there will stand up David worthy of his descendant the Lord, and declare: <q>I, Lord, proclaimed you by every means; I set forth that only your name was to be worshipped; I said, 'Blessed is the man  who fears the Lord'; I said too, 'The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall  be joyful in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>'; and I said, 'The desire of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>  shall perish,' that these people might acknowledge you and cease to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. I, when I had become possessed of royal power, clothed in sackcloth, with dust spread beneath me, and with the emblems of my greatness laid aside, lay down in my clothes, that an example might be given to these people of gentleness and humility. I spared my enemies who desired to slay me, that these people might approve of my mercifulness, as worthy of being imitated.</q> After him, Isaiah, who was worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, will not be silent; but will say: <q>I, Lord, while you were speaking through my mouth, gave this warning&mdash;'Woe to those <span class="stiki" id="note350156"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;5:8</a></span> who join house to house,' that I might set a limit to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. I bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> came upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, that at any rate <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment, if not hope of reward, might keep back these people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>.</q></p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p>After these, and several others who have discharged for us the duties of instruction, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> himself will speak thus: <q>I, certainly, exalted on a lofty seat, holding heaven in my hand, and the earth in my fist, extended within and without, in the inside of all things which are produced, and on the outside of all  things that move, inconceivable, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in the power  of nature, invisible to sight, inaccessible to touch, in order that I might exist as the least of you (for the purpose of subduing the hardness of your heart and for softening your faithlessness by sound doctrines), condescended to be born in flesh, and, having laid aside the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I assumed the form of a servant, so that, sharing with you in bodily infirmity, I might in turn bring you to a participation in my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, through <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the precept of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. I restored health to the sick and infirm, hearing to the deaf, sight to the blind, the power of speech to the dumb, and the use of their feet to the lame; that I might influence you, by heavenly signs, all the more easily to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me, and in those things which I had announced, I promised you the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; I also, in order that you might have an example of escape from punishment, placed in Paradise the robber who acknowledged me almost at the moment of his death, that you might follow even the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of him who had been thought worthy of having his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven him. And that by my example in your behalf, you yourselves also might be able to suffer; I suffered for you, that no man might hesitate to suffer for himself what God  had endured for man. I showed myself after my resurrection, in order that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might not be overthrown. I admonished the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the person of Peter; I preached to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in the person of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; and I do not regret doing so, for good results followed. The good have understood my work; the faithful have perfected it; the righteous have completed it; the merciful have consummated it: there have been a large number of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and a large number of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Those to whom I thus refer were undoubtedly in the same body and in the same world as you. Why, then, do I find no good work in you, you descendants of vipers? You have shown no repentance for your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, even at the very end of your earthly course. And what does it profit that you <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> me with your lips, when you deny me by your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and works? Where are now your riches, where your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, where your powers, and where your pleasures? I pronounce no new sentence over you: you simply incur the judgment which I formerly predicted.</q></p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p>Then will the Evangelist repeat this to the wretched beings, <q>Go <span class="stiki" id="note350160"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;22:13</a></span> into outer darkness, where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</q> O you miserable men, whom these words do not now impress! They shall then see their own punishment, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of others. Let them use this present world, provided they do not enjoy that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> which is prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Let them abound in riches: let them rest on gold; provided that there they be found needy and destitute. Let them be <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> in this world, provided they be poor in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, for it is written regarding them, <q>The rich were in  want, and suffered hunger.</q> But the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has added what follows respecting the good&mdash;<q>but those who seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.</q></p>

<p>Therefore, my sister, although those people mock at us, and although they call us foolish and unhappy, let us all the more joyfully exult in such reproaches, by which <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is heaped up for us, and punishment for them. And do not let us laugh at their folly, but rather grieve over their unhappiness; because there is among them a large number of our own people, whom if we win over, our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall be increased. But however they may conduct themselves, let them be to us as <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>; but let us keep ourselves safe and sound. If they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> now over us lamenting, it will be our turn afterwards to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over their suffering. Farewell, dearest sister, and tenderly beloved in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Letter 2</h2>

<p class="subh">A Letter of Sulpitius Severus to His Sister Claudia Concerning Virginity.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>How great blessedness, among heavenly gifts, belongs to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, besides the testimonies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, we learn also from the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by which we are taught that a peculiar merit belongs to those who have devoted themselves to it by special consecration. For while the whole multitude of those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> receive equal gifts of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the same blessings of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, those who are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> possess something above the rest, since, out of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and unstained company of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they are chosen by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and are presented by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>  at the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if being more <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, on account of the merits of their <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> dedication. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as it is the offering of so precious a being, and none will please him more than the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of his own image. For I think that the Apostle especially referred to a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of this kind, when he said, <q>Now, I beseech you, brethren, by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you present your bodies a living <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and acceptable <span class="stiki" id="note350163"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;12:1</a></span> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Virginity, therefore, possesses both that which others have, and that which others have not; while it obtains both common and special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and rejoices (so to speak) in its own peculiar privilege of consecration. For <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority permits us to style <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> also the brides of Christ; while, after the manner of brides, it veils those whom it consecrates to the Lord, openly exhibiting those as very especially about to possess spiritual marriage who have fled away from carnal fellowship. And those are worthily united, after a spiritual manner, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in accordance with the analogy of marriage, who, from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to him, have set at nought <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> alliances. In their case, that saying of the apostle finds its fullest possible fulfillment, <q>He who is joined to the Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note350164"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:17</a></span> is one spirit.</q></p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>For it is a great and a divine thing, almost beyond a corporeal nature, to lay aside  luxury, and to extinguish, by strength of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the flame of concupiscence, kindled by the torch of youth; to put down by spiritual effort the force of natural delight; to live in opposition to the practice of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; to despise the comforts of wedlock; to disdain the sweet enjoyments derived from children; and to regard as nothing, in the hope of future blessedness, everything that is reckoned among the advantages of this present life. This is, as I have said, a great and admirable <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and is not undeservedly destined to a vast reward, in proportion to the greatness of its labor. The <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>I will give to the eunuchs, says the Lord, a place in my house and within my walls, a place counted better than  sons and daughters; I will give them an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> name, and it shall not <span class="stiki" id="note350167"><a href="../bible/isa056.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;56:5</a></span> fail.</q> The Lord again speaks concerning such eunuchs in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, saying, <q>For there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven's</a> sake.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350168"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;19:12</a></span> Great, indeed, is the struggle connected with <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, but greater is the reward; the restraint is temporal, but the reward will be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For the blessed Apostle John also speaks concerning these, saying that <q>they follow the Lamb wherever he goes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350169"><a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse4">Revelation&nbsp;14:4</a></span> This, I think, is to be understood to the following effect, that there will be no place in the court of heaven closed against them, but that all the habitations of the divine mansions will be thrown open before them.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>But that the merit of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> may shine forth more clearly, and that there may be a better understanding as to how worthy it is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let this be considered, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, our Saviour, when, for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, he condescended to assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, chose no other than a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> womb, that he might show how <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of this kind especially pleased him; and that he might point out the blessedness of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> to both sexes, he had a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> mother, while he himself was ever to remain in a like condition. He thus furnished in his own person to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and in the person of his mother to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, an example of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, by which it might be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, with respect to both sexes, that the blessed state of purity possessed the fullness of divinity,  for whatever dwelt in the Son was also wholly in the mother. But why should I take pains to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the excellent and surpassing merit of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and to set forth the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> good of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, when I am not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that many have discoursed on this subject, and have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> its blessedness by most conclusive reasons, and since it can never be a matter of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to any reflecting <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that a thing has all the more merit, the more difficult it is of accomplishment? For if any one judges <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> to be of no moment or only of small consequence, it is certain that he is either <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the matter, or is not willing to incur the trouble it implies. Hence it comes to pass that those always derogate from the importance of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, who either do not possess it, or who are unwillingly compelled to maintain it.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>

<p>Now, therefore, since we have set forth, although in few words, both the difficulty and the merit of purity, great care must be taken lest a matter which in itself implies great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and is also destined to a vast reward, should fail to produce its proper fruits. For the more precious every sort of thing is, the more it is guarded with anxious solicitude. And since there are many things which fail to secure their proper excellence, unless they are assisted by the aid of other things, as is, for instance, the case with honey, which, unless it is preserved by the protection of wax, and by the cells of the honeycombs, and is indeed, to state the matter more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, sustained by these, loses its deliciousness and cannot exist apart by itself; and again as it is with wine, which, unless it be kept in vessels of a pleasant odor, and with the pitch frequently renewed, loses the power of its natural sweetness; so great care must be taken lest perchance some things may be necessary also to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, without which it can by no means produce its proper fruits, and thus a matter of so great difficulty may be of no advantage (while all the time it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be of advantage), because it is possessed without the other necessary adjuncts. For unless I am mistaken, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is preserved in its entirety, for the sake of the reward to be obtained in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, which it is perfectly certain no one can obtain who does  not deserve <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. But that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life cannot be merited except by the keeping of all the divine commandments, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> testifies, saying, <q>If you will enter into life, keep the commandments.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350172"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;19:17</a></span> Therefore no one has that life, except the man who has kept all the precepts of the law, and he who has not such life cannot be a possessor of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, in which it is not the dead, but the living who shall reign. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, which hopes for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, will profit nothing by itself, unless it also possess that to which <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life is promised, by means of which the reward of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is possessed. Above all things, therefore, the commandments which have been enjoined upon us must be kept by those who preserve <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in its entireness, and who are hoping for its reward from the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest otherwise the pains taken to maintain a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and continence come to nothing. No one acquainted with the law does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is above  the commandment or precept, as the Apostle says, <q>Now, as to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, I have no precept of the Lord, but I give my advice.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350174"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> When, therefore, he simply gives advice about maintaining <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and lays down no precept, he acknowledges that it is above the commandment. Those, therefore, who preserve <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, do more than the commandment requires. But it will then only profit you to have done more than was commanded, if you also do that which is commanded. For how can you boast that you have done more, if, in respect to some point, you do less? Desiring to fulfill the Divine counsel, see that, above all things, you keep the commandment: wishing to attain to the reward of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, see that you keep fast hold of what is necessary to merit life, that your <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> may be such as can receive a recompense. For as the observance of the commandments ensures life, so, on the other hand, does the violation give rise to death. And he who through disobedience has been doomed to death cannot hope for the crown pertaining to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>; nor, when really handed over to punishment, can he expect the reward promised to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>Now, there are three kinds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by means of which the possession of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is secured. The first is <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, the second, contempt of the world, and the third, righteousness, which, as when joined together, they very greatly benefit their possessors, so, when separated, they can hardly be of any advantage, since every one of them is required, not for its own sake only, but for the sake of another. First of all, then, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is demanded, that contempt of the world may more easily follow, because the world can be more easily despised by those who are not held fast in the bonds of matrimony. Contempt of the world, again, is required, in order that righteousness may be maintained, which those can with difficulty fully preserve who are involved in desires after worldly advantages, and in the pursuit of mundane pleasures. Whosoever, therefore, possesses the first kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, but does not, at the same time, have the second, which is contempt of the world, possesses the first almost to no purpose, since he does not have the second, for the sake of which the first was required. And if any one possesses the first and second, but is destitute of the third which is righteousness, he labors in vain, since the former two are principally required for the sake of the third. For what profits it to possess <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in order to contempt of the world, and yet not to have that on account of which you have the other? Or why should you despise the things of the world, if you do not observe righteousness, for the sake of which it is fitting that you should possess <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, as well as contempt for the world? For as the first kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is on account of the second, and the second on account of the third, so the first and the second are on account of the third; and if it does not exist, neither the first nor the second will prove of any advantage.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p>But you perhaps say here, <q>Teach me, then, what righteousness is, so that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it, I may be able more easily to fully practice it.</q> Well, I shall briefly explain it to you, as I am able, and shall use the simplicity of common words, seeing that the subject of which we treat is such as ought by no means to be obscured by attempts at eloquent description, but should be opened up by the simplest forms of expression. For a matter which is necessary to all in common ought to be set forth in a common sort of speech. Righteousness, then, is nothing else than not to commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and not to commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is just to keep the precepts of the law. Now, the observance of these precepts is maintained in a two-fold way&mdash; thus, that one do none of those things which are forbidden, and that he strive to fulfill the things which are commanded. This is the meaning of the following statement: <q>Depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do  good.</q> For I do not wish you to think that righteousness consists simply in not doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since not to do good is also <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and a transgression of the law takes place in both, since he who said, <q>Depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></q> said also, <q>and do good.</q> If you depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do not do good, you are a transgressor of the law, which is fulfilled, not simply by abhorring all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, but also by the performance of good works. For, indeed, you have not merely received this commandment, that you should not deprive one who is clothed of his garments, but that you should cover with your own the man who has been deprived of his; nor that you should not take away bread of his own from one who has it, but that you should willingly impart of your bread to him who has none; nor that you should not simply not drive away a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man from a shelter of his own, but that you should receive him when he has been driven out, and has no shelter, into your own. For the precept which has been given us is <q>to weep with them that <span class="stiki" id="note350176"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;12:15</a></span> weep.</q> But how can we weep with them, if we share in none of their necessities, and afford no help to them in those matters on account of which they lament? For God does not call for the fruitless moisture of our tears; but, because tears are an indication of grief, he wishes you to feel the distresses of another as if they were your own. And just as you would wish aid to be given you if you were in such tribulation, so should you help another in accordance with the statement, <q>Whatsoever you would that men should do unto you, do even so <span class="stiki" id="note350177"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;7:12</a></span> to them.</q> For to weep with one that weeps, and at the same time to refuse to help, when you can, him that weeps, is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of mockery, and not of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. In short, our Saviour wept with Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the feeling of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> compassion within him by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of his tears. But works, as the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> affection soon followed, when Lazarus, for whose sake the tears were shed, was raised up and restored to his sisters. This was sincerely to weep with those who wept, when the occasion of the weeping was removed. But he did it, you will say, as having the power. Well, nothing is demanded of you which it is impossible for you to perform: he has fulfilled his entire duty who has done what he could.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p>But (as we had begun to remark) it is not sufficient for a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to keep himself from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, unless he also has fulfilled the duties implied in good works, as is very distinctly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by that statement in which the Lord threatened that those will be doomed to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, who, although they have done no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, have not done all that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, declaring, <q>Then will the king say to those who are on his right hand: depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> fire, which my Father has prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no <span class="stiki" id="note350178"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> drink,</q> with what follows. He did not say, <q>Depart from me, you cursed, because you have committed <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or theft</q>; for it is not because they had done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but because they had not done good, that they are condemned, and doomed to the punishments of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Gehenna; nor because they had committed things which were forbidden, but because they had not been willing to do those things which had been commanded. And from this it is to be observed what hope those can have, who, in addition, do some of those things which are forbidden, when even such are doomed to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> as have simply not done the things which are commanded. For I do not wish you to flatter yourself in this way&mdash;if you have not done certain things, because you have done certain other things, since it is written, <q>Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, has become guilty of all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350179"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse10">James&nbsp;2:10</a></span> For Adam <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> once, and died; and do you think that you can live, when you are often doing that which killed another person, when he had only done it once? Or do you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that he committed a great crime, and was therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemned to a severer punishment? Let us consider, then, what it was he really did. He ate of the fruit of the tree, contrary to the commandment. What then? Did God punish man with death for the sake of the fruit of a tree? No: not on account of the fruit of the tree, but on account of the contempt of the commandment. The question, therefore, is not about the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the offense, but about the transgression of the commandment. And the same being who told <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> not to eat of the fruit of the tree, has commanded you not to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not to lie, not to detract, not to listen to a detractor, to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> not at all, not to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>, not to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, not to be drunken, not to be greedy, not to render <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to any one, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your enemies, to bless them that curse you, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them that malign and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you, to turn the other cheek to one smiting you, and not to go to law before a worldly tribunal, so that, if any one seeks to take away your goods, you should joyfully lose them, to flee from the charge of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, to beware of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of all <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and boastfulness, and live, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and meek, after the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, avoiding fellowship with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> so completely that you will not even eat with fornicators, or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or those that speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of others, or the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, or detractors, or the drunken, or the rapacious. Now, if you despise him in any such matter, then, if he spared Adam, he will also spare you. Yea, he might have been spared with better reason than you, inasmuch as he was still <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and inexperienced, and was restrained by the example of no one who had previously <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and who had died on account of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But after such examples as you possess, after the law, after the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>, and after the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, if you still set your mind on transgressing, I see not in what way pardon can be extended to you.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<p>Do you flatter yourself on account of the attribute of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>? Remember <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> fell when they were <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and that the perfect purity of their bodies did not profit them when they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. The virgin who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is to be compared to Eve, and not to Mary. We do not deny that, in the present life, there is the remedy of repentance, but we remind you rather to hope for reward, than to look for pardon. For it is disgraceful that those should ask for indulgence who are expecting the crown of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and that those should commit anything unlawful who have even cut themselves off from things lawful; for it must be remembered that it is lawful to contract an alliance by marriage. And as those are to be praised who, from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, have despised the tie of wedlock, so those are to be condemned who, through the pleasure of incontinence, after they have vowed themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have recourse to the Apostolic remedy. Therefore, as we have said, those who decline marriage despise not things unlawful, but things lawful. And if that class of people <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, if they speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of others, if they are detractors, or if they patiently listen to detractors, if they return <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, if they incur the charge of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> with respect to other people's property, or of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> in regard to their own, if they cherish the poison of revenge or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, if they either say or think anything unbefitting against the institutions of the law or the Apostles, if with a desire of pleasing in the flesh, they exhibit themselves dressed up and adorned, if they do any other unlawful things, as is only too common, what will it profit them to have spurned what is lawful, while they practice what is not lawful? If you wish it to be of advantage to you, that you have despised things lawful, take care that you do not any of those things which are not lawful. For, it is foolish to have dreaded that which is in its nature less, and not to dread that which is intrinsically more [or not to avoid those things  which are interdicted, while such things as are permitted meet with contempt]. For the Apostle says, <q>She that is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how she may please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in body and spirit; but she who is married cares for the things of this world, how she may please <span class="stiki" id="note350181"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse34">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:34</a></span> her husband.</q> He thus affirms that the married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> pleases her husband by thinking of worldly things, while the unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> pleases <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as she has no anxiety about the things of the world. Let him tell me, then, whom <em>she</em> desires to please, who has no husband, and yet cares for the things of the world? Shall not the married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, in such a case, be preferred to her? Yes, since she by caring for the things of the world pleases at least her husband, but the other neither pleases her husband, since she does not have one, nor can she please God.  But it is not fitting that we should pass over in silence that which he said: <q>The unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> cares for the things of the Lord, how she may please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in body and spirit</q> [she cares, he says, for the things of the Lord; she does not care for the things of the world, or of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but for the things of God]. What, then, <em>are</em> the things of the Lord? Let the Apostle tell: <q>Whatsoever  things are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and if there be any praise of doctrine</q>: these are the things of the Lord, which <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> apostolic <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> meditate upon, and think of, day and night, without any interval of time. Of the Lord is the resurrection of the dead, of the Lord is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, of the Lord is incorruption, of the Lord is that splendor of the sun which is promised to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father</q>: <span class="stiki" id="note350184"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse43">Matthew&nbsp;13:43</a></span> of the Lord are the many mansions of the righteous in the heavens, of the Lord is the fruit which is produced, whether thirty fold, or sixty fold, or an hundred fold. Those <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who think on these things, and by what works they may be able to merit them, think of the things of the Lord. Of the Lord, too, is the law of the new and old testament, in which shine forth the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> utterances of his lips; and if any <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> meditate without intermission on these things, they think of the things of the Lord. In that case, there is fulfilled in them the saying of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>The <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <span class="stiki" id="note350185"><!--k28--<a href="../bible/ecc026.htm#verse24">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;26:24</a></span> foundations are upon a solid rock, and the commands of God are in the heart of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q></p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<p>There follows the clause <q>how she may please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I say, not men,&mdash; <q>that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in body and spirit.</q> He does not say that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> only in a member or in the body, but that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in body and spirit. For a member is only one part of the body, but the body is a union of all the members. When, therefore, he says that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in the body, he testifies that she ought to be sanctified in all her members, because the sanctification of the other members will not avail, if corruption be found remaining in one. Also, <em>she</em> will not be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in body (which consists of all the members), who is defiled by the pollution of even one of them. But in order that what I say may be made more obvious and clear, suppose the case of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is purified by the sanctification of all her other members, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> only with her tongue, inasmuch as she either speaks <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>  of people or bears false testimony, will all her other members secure the acquittal of one, or will all the rest be judged on account of the one? If, therefore, the sanctification of the other members will not avail, even when one only is at fault, how much more, if all are corrupted by the guilt of various <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, will the perfection of one be of no avail?</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Wherefore</span>, I beseech you, O virgin, do not flatter yourself on the ground of your purity alone, and do not trust in the perfection of one member; but according to the Apostle, maintain the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of your body throughout. Cleanse your head from all defilement, because it is a disgrace that it, after the sanctifying oil has been applied to it, should be polluted with the juice or powder of either crocus, or any other pigment, or should be adorned with gold or gems or any other earthly ornament, because it already shines with the radiance of heavenly adornment. It is undoubtedly a grave insult to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> to prefer to it any mundane and worldly ornament. And next, cleanse your forehead, that it may blush at <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and not at Divine works, and may display that shame which gives rise not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but to the favor of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the sacred Scripture declares, <q>There is a shame that causes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and there is a shame that brings with it the favor <span class="stiki" id="note350187"><a href="../bible/ecc004.htm#verse21">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;4:21</a></span> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Cleanse, too, your neck, that it may not carry your  locks in a golden net and necklaces hung round it, but may rather bear about it those ornaments of which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>Let not <span class="stiki" id="note350189"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse3">Proverbs&nbsp;3:3</a></span> mercy and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> depart from you,</q> and hang them upon your heart as upon your neck. Cleanse your eyes, while you withdraw them from all concupiscence, and dost never turn them away from the sight of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and dost keep them from all dyes, in that purity in which they were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

I beg you not to think it is an inverted order that I have said the tongue should be cleansed from swearing before <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, for one will then the more easily escape <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, if he swears not at all, so that there may be fulfilled in him that statement, <q>Keep  your tongue from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and your lips from speaking guile.</q> And be mindful of the Apostle who says, <q>Bless, and <span class="stiki" id="note350192"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;12:14</a></span> curse not.</q> But often call to mind the following words, <q>See that no one render <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to any man, or cursing for cursing, but on the contrary, bless them, because to this you have been called, that you should possess a blessing  by inheritance</q>; and this other passage, <q>If any <span class="stiki" id="note350194"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James&nbsp;3:2</a></span> one offend not in tongue, he is a perfect man.</q> For it is shameful that those lips, by which you confess <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to him, bless him, and praise him, should be defiled by the pollution of any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not with what <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> any one can <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to God with that tongue with which he either speaks <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniates</a>, or detracts. God listens to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> lips, and speedily answers those <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which an unpolluted tongue pours forth. Cleanse also your ears, so that they may not listen except to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> discourse, that they never admit into them obscene, or <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>, or worldly words, or tolerate any one detracting from another, on account of that which is written, Hedge up <span class="stiki" id="note350195"><!--k28--<a href="../bible/ecc028.htm#verse24">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;28:24</a></span> your ears with thorns, and do not listen to a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> tongue, that you may have your part with him, of whom it is said, that he was <span class="stiki" id="note350196"><a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:8</a></span> righteous in hearing and seeing; i.e. he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> neither with his eyes nor his ears.

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<p><span class="sc">I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a></span> that I have now set forth, briefly indeed, but, at the same time, fully, what is implied in a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> purity of body: it remains that we should learn what it is to be pure also in spirit; i.e. that what it is unlawful for one to do in act, it is also unlawful for one even to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> in thought. For she is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, alike in body and in spirit, who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> neither in mind nor heart, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that God is one who examines also the heart; and, therefore, she takes every pains to possess a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> as well as a body free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Such a person is aware that it is written, <q>Keep your <span class="stiki" id="note350199"><a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse23">Proverbs&nbsp;4:23</a></span> heart with all diligence</q>; and again, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves  <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hearts, and all the undefiled are acceptable to him</q>; and elsewhere, <q>Blessed <span class="stiki" id="note350201"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> are those of a pure heart; for they shall see God.</q> I think that this last statement is made regarding those whom <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> accuses of the guilt of no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; concerning whom I think that John also spoke in his Epistle when he said, <q>If our heart <span class="stiki" id="note350202"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:21</a></span> condemn us not, then have we confidence towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and whatsoever we ask we shall receive from him.</q> I do not wish you to think that you have escaped the accusation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although act does not follow desire, since it is written, <q>Whosoever <span class="stiki" id="note350203"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> looks on a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her, has already committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her in his heart.</q> And do not say, <q>I had the thought, indeed, but I did not carry it out in act</q>; for it is unlawful even to desire that which it is unlawful to do. Wherefore also blessed Peter issues a precept to this effect: <q>purify your <span class="stiki" id="note350204"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:22</a></span> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a></q>; and if he had not been aware of such a thing as defilement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he would not have expressed a desire that it should be purified. But we should also very carefully consider that passage which says, <q>These <span class="stiki" id="note350205"><a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse4">Revelation&nbsp;14:4</a></span> are they who did not defile themselves with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, for they remained <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and they follow the Lamb wherever he goes</q>; and should reflect whether, if these are joined to the Divine retinue, and traverse all the regions of the heavens, through the merit of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and purity alone, there may be also other means by which <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> being assisted may attain to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of so great blessedness. But whence shall we be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this? From the following passages (if I mistake not) in which it is written, <q>These were  purchased from among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as the first fruits to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Lamb, and in their mouth there was found no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, for they are without spot before the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> You see, then, that they are spoken of as closely following in the footsteps of the Lord, not in virtue of one member only, but those are said to do so, who, besides <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, had passed a life freed from all the pollution of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore, let the virgin especially despise marriage on this account, that, while she is safer than others, she may the more easily accomplish what is also required from those who are married; viz. keep herself from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> all the commandments of the law. For if she does not marry, and nevertheless indulges in those things from which even married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are enjoined to keep themselves free, what will it profit her not to have married? For although it is not allowed to any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and it befits all without exception who are purified through the sanctification of the spiritual bath, to lead an unstained life, that they may be thoroughly identified  with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is described as being <q>without <span class="stiki" id="note350208"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians&nbsp;5:27</a></span> spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,</q> much more is it requisite that a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> should reach this standard, whom neither the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a husband, nor of sons, nor of any other necessity, prevents from fully carrying out the demands of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture; nor shall she be able, if she fail, to defend herself by any sort of excuse.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

<p>O Virgin, maintain your purpose which is destined for a great reward. Eminent with the Lord is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and purity, if it be not disfigured by other kinds of lapses into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Realize your state, realize your position, realize your purpose. You are called the bride of Christ; see that you commit no act which is unworthy of him to whom you profess to be <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>. He will quickly write a bill of divorcement, if he perceive in you even one act of unfaithfulness. Accordingly, whosoever receives those gifts which, as an earnest, are bestowed in the case of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> betrothals, immediately begins earnestly and diligently to enquire of domestics, intimates, and friends, what is the character of the young man, what he especially loves, what he receives, in what style he lives, what habits he practices, what luxuries he indulges in, and in what pursuits he finds his chief pleasure and delight. And when she has learned these things, she so conducts herself, in all respects, that her service, her cheerfulness, her diligence, and her whole mode of life, may be in harmony with the character of her <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>. And you, who hast Christ as your bridegroom, enquire from the domestics and intimates of that bridegroom of yours what is his character; yes, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> and skillfully enquire in what things he specially delights, what sort of arrangement he loves in your dress, and what kind of adornment he desires. Let his most intimate associate Peter tell you, who does not allow personal adorning even to married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as he has written in his epistle, <q>Let wives,  in like manner, be subject to their own husbands, so that, if any <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not the word, they may, without the word, be won over by the conduct of their wives, contemplating their chaste behavior in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and let theirs not be an outward adornment of the hair, or the putting on of gold, or elegance in the apparel which is adopted, but let there be the hidden man of the heart in the stainlessness  of a peaceful and modest spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</q> Let another apostle also tell you, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, who, writing to Timothy, gives his approval to the same things in regard to the conduct of believing <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: <q>Let wives  in like manner adorn themselves with the ornament of a habit of modesty and sobriety, not with curled hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array, but as becomes <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that profess <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, with good and upright behavior.</q></p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>

<p>But perhaps you say, <q>Why did not the Apostles enjoin these things on <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>?</q> Because they did not think that necessary, lest such an exhortation, if given to them, might rather seem an insult than a means of edification. Nor, in fact, would they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> could ever proceed to such an extreme of hardihood, as to claim for themselves carnal and worldly ornaments, not permitted even to married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Undoubtedly, the virgin ought to adorn and array herself; for how can she be able to please her <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, if she does not come forth in a neat and ornamental form? Let her be adorned by all means, but let her ornaments be of an internal and spiritual kind, and not of a carnal nature; for God desires in her a beauty not of the body, but of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Do thou, therefore, who desirest that your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be loved and dwelt in by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, array it with all diligence, and adorn it with spiritual garments. Let nothing unbecoming, nothing repulsive, be seen in it. Let it shine with the gold of righteousness, and gleam with the gems of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and glitter with the most precious pearl of purity; instead of fine linen and silk, let it be arrayed in the robe of mercifulness and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, according to what is written, <q>Put <span class="stiki" id="note350212"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse12">Colossians&nbsp;3:12</a></span> on, therefore, as the elect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and beloved bowels of mercy, kindness, humility,</q> and so forth. And let the virgin not ask for the beauty due to ceruse,  or any other pigment, but let her have the brightness of innocence and simplicity, the rosy hue of modesty, and the purple glow of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> shamefacedness. Let her be washed with the nitre of heavenly doctrine, and purified by all spiritual lavements.  Let no stain of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be left in her. And lest, at any time, she should give forth the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> odor of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, let her be imbued, through and through, with the most pleasant ointment of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>

<p>God seeks for adornment of this kind, and desires a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> arrayed in such a manner. Remember that you are called the daughter of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to what he says, <q>Hearken,  O daughter, and consider.</q> But you yourself also, as often as you call God your Father, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that you are the daughter of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore, if you are the daughter of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, take care that you do none of those things which are unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your Father; but do all things as being the daughter of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Reflect how the daughters of nobles in this world conduct themselves, to what habits they are accustomed and by what exercises they train themselves. In some of them, there is so great modesty, so great dignity, so great self-restraint, that they excel the habits of other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings in regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> nobleness, and, lest they should attach any mark of disgrace on their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> by their failure, they strive to acquire another  nature for themselves by the mode of their acting in the world. And do you, therefore, have regard to your origin, consider your descent, attend to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of your nobility. Acknowledge that you are not merely the daughter of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and adorned with the nobility of a divine birth. So present yourself to the world that your heavenly birth be seen in you, and your divine nobleness shine clearly forth. Let there be in you a new dignity, an admirable <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, a notable modesty, a marvelous patience, a gait becoming a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> with a bearing of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> shamefacedness, speech always modest, and such as is uttered only at the proper time, so that whosoever beholds you may admiringly exclaim: <q>What is this exhibition of new dignity among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? What is this striking modesty, what this well-balanced excellence, what this ripeness of wisdom? This is not the outcome of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> training or of mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> discipline. Something heavenly sheds its fragrance on me in that earthly body. I really <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God does reside in some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings.</q> And when he comes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are a handmaid of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he will be seized with the greater amazement, and will reflect how marvelous must be the Master, when his handmaid manifests such excellence.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>

<p>If you wish, then, to be with Christ, you must live according to the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was so far removed from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that he did not render a recompense even to his enemies, but rather even <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them. For I do not wish you to reckon those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, who (I do not say) <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> either their brothers or sisters, but who do not, before God as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their neighbors with their whole heart and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, since it is a bounden duty for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, after the example of Christ himself, even to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their enemies. If you desire to possess fellowship with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, cleanse your heart from the thought of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Let no one circumvent you; let no one delude you by beguiling speech. The court of heaven will admit none except the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and righteous, and simple, and innocent, and pure. Evil has no place in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is necessary that he who desires to reign with Christ should be free from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and guile. Nothing is so offensive, and nothing so detestable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> any one, to wish to harm any one; while nothing is so acceptable to him as to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to it when he teaches, <q>You who  <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q></p>

<h3>Chapter 16</h3>

<p>Take heed that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in any respect, lest your portion also be reckoned among those to whom it was said, <q>How <span class="stiki" id="note350218"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;5:44</a></span> can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, who seek <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, one from another?</q> and of whom it is said through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>Increase  <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to them; increase <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to the boastful of the earth</q>; and elsewhere, <q>You are confounded  from your boasting, from your reproaching in the sight of the Lord.</q> For I do not wish you to have regard to those, who are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of the world, and not of Christ; who unmindful of their purpose and profession, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in delicacies, are delighted with riches, and boast of their descent from a merely carnal nobility; who, if they assuredly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> themselves to be the daughters of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, would never, after their divine ancestry, admire mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> nobility, nor <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in any <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> earthly father: if they felt that they had God as their Father, they would not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> any nobility connected with the flesh. Why, you foolish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, do you flatter yourself about the nobleness of your descent, and take delight in it? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at the beginning, created two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, from whom the whole multitude of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> has descended; and thus it is not the equity of nature, but the ambition of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desire, which has given rise to worldly nobility. Unquestionably, we are all rendered equal by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the divine  bath, and there can be no difference among those, whom the second birth has generated, by means of which alike the rich man and the poor man, the free man and the slave, the nobly born and the lowly born, is rendered a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>. Thus mere earthly rank is overshadowed by the brilliance of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and henceforth is taken no account of, while those who formerly had been unequal in worldly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> are now equally arrayed in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of a heavenly and divine nobility. There is now among such no place for lowness of birth; nor is any one inferior to another whom the majesty of the divine birth adorns; except in the estimation of those who do not think that the things of heaven are to be preferred to those of earth. There can be no worldly boasting among them, if they reflect how vain a thing it is that they should, in smaller matters, prefer themselves to those whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be equal to themselves in greater matters, and should regard, as placed below themselves on earth, those whom they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be equal to themselves in what relates to heaven. But you, who are a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and not of the world, flee from all the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of this present life, that you may attain to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is promised in the world to come.</p>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>

<p>Avoid words of contention and causes of animosity: flee also from all occasions of discord and strife. For if, according to the doctrine of the Apostle <q>the servant <span class="stiki" id="note350222"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse24">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:24</a></span> of the Lord must not strive,</q> how much more does this become the handmaid of the Lord, whose mind ought to be more gentle, as her sex is more bashful and retiring. Restrain your tongue from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speaking, and put the bridle of the law upon your mouth; so that you shall speak, if you speak at all, only when it would be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be silent. Beware lest you utter anything which might be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> found fault with. A word once spoken is like a stone which has been thrown: wherefore it should be long thought over before it is uttered. Blessed, assuredly, are the lips, which never utter what they would wish to recall. The talk of a chaste mind ought itself also to be chaste, such as may always rather edify than injure the hearers, according to that commandment of the Apostle when he says, <q>Let no <span class="stiki" id="note350223"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse29">Ephesians&nbsp;4:29</a></span> corrupt communications proceed out of your mouth, but that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the edification of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that it may convey <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to them that hear.</q> Precious to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is that tongue which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not to form words except about divine things, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> is that mouth from which heavenly utterances continually flow forth. Put down by the authority of Scripture <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a> of those who are absent, as being evil-minded <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> mentions this also as among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of a perfect man, if, in the presence of the righteous an evil-minded man, who brings forward things against his neighbor which cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, is brought down to nothing. For it is not lawful for you patiently to listen to evil-speaking against another, inasmuch as you would not wish that to be done by others when directed against yourself. Certainly, everything is unrighteous which goes against the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that is the case, if you quietly permit anything to be done to another, which you would feel painful, if done by any one to yourself. Accustom your tongue always to speak about those who are good, and lend your ears rather to listen to the praises of good men than to the condemnation of such as are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Take heed that all the good actions you perform are done for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that for every such deed you will only receive a reward, so far as you have done it out of regard to his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Study rather to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> than to appear so, because it is of no avail to be reckoned what you are not; and the guilt of a twofold <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contracted when you do not have what you are credited with having, and when you pretend to possess what you do not possess.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>

<p>Delight yourself rather in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> than in feastings, mindful of that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who did not depart from the temple, but served God with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> day and night. Now, if she who was a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and a Jewish <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> herself such, what is it fitting that a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of Christ should now attain to? Love more than any other thing the feast of the divine word, and desire that you be filled with spiritual dainties, while you seek for such food as refreshes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, rather than for that which only pleases the body. Flee from all kinds of flesh and wine, as being the sources of heat and provocatives to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. And only then, if need be, use a little wine, when the stomach's uneasiness, or great infirmity of body, requires you to do so. Subdue <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, restrain enmity, and whatever there may be which gives rise to remorse when it is done, avoid as an abomination giving rise  to immediate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It is fitting that that mind should be very tranquil and quiet, as well as free from all the tumults of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which desires to be the dwelling-place of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as he testifies through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, <q>Upon <span class="stiki" id="note350225"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;66:2</a></span> what other man shall I rest than upon him who is <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and quiet, and who trembles at my words?</q> Believe that God is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of all your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and thoughts, and take good heed lest you either do or think anything which is unworthy of the divine eyesight. When you desire to engage in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, show yourself in such a frame of mind as becomes one who is to speak with the Lord.</p>

<h3>Chapter 19</h3>

<p>When you repeat  a psalm, consider whose words you are repeating and delight yourself more with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> contrition of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, than with the pleasantness of a trilling voice. For God sets a higher value on the tears of one thus praising  him, than on the beauty of his voice; as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>Serve  the Lord with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with trembling.</q> Now, where there are <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling, there is no lifting up of the voice, but humility of mind with lamentation and tears. Display diligence in all your doings; for it is written, <q>Cursed <span class="stiki" id="note350229"><a href="../bible/jer048.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;48:10</a></span> is the man who carelessly performs the work of the Lord.</q> Let <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> grow in you with years; let righteousness increase with age; and let your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> appear the more perfect the older you become; for Jesus, who has left us an example how to live, increased not only in years as respected his body, but in wisdom and spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> before God and men. Reckon all the time in which you do not perceive yourself growing better as positively lost. Maintain to the last that purpose of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> which you have formed; for it is the part of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not merely to begin, but to finish, as the Lord says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>Whosoever <span class="stiki" id="note350230"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;10:22</a></span> shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.</q> Beware, therefore, lest you furnish to any one an occasion even of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desire, because your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to you, is jealous; for an adulteress against Christ is more guilty than one against her husband. Be, therefore, a model of life to all; be an example; and excel in actual conduct those whom you precede in your consecration  to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Show yourself in all respects a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; and let no stain of corruption be brought as a charge against your person. And let one whose body is perfect in its purity be also irreproachable in conduct. Now, as we said in the beginning of this letter, that you have become a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, such a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> as undoubtedly imparts its own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> also to others, that, as every one worthily receives from it, he himself also may be a partaker of sanctification, so then, let the other <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> also be sanctified through you, as by means of a divine offering. Show yourself to them so <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in all things, that, whosoever comes in contact with your life, whether by hearing or seeing, may experience the power of sanctification, and may feel that such an amount of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> passes to him from your manner of acting, that, while he desires to imitate you, he himself becomes worthy of being a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> devoted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Letter 3</h2>

<p class="subh">A Letter of Severus to Holy <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Bishop.</p>

<p>After I learned that all your cooks had given  up your kitchen (I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> because they felt indignant at having to fulfill the duty towards cheap dishes of pulse ), I sent a little boy to you out of our own workshop. He is quite skillful enough to cook pale beans and to pickle homely beet-root, with vinegar and sauce, as well as to prepare cheap porridge for the jaws of the hungry <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing, however, of pepper or of laser,  but he is quite at home with cumin, and is especially clever in plying the noisy mortar with sweetly smelling plants. He has one fault, that he is no kindly foe to admit to any garden; for if let in, he will mow down with a sword all things within his reach, and he will never be satisfied with the slaughter simply of mallows. However, in furnishing himself with fuel he will not swindle you. He will burn whatever comes in his way; he will cut down and not hesitate to lay hands upon buildings, and to carry off old beams from the household. We present him, then, to you, with this character and these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and we wish you to regard him not as a servant, but as a son, because you are not ashamed to be the father of very small creatures. I myself would have wished to serve you instead of him; but if good-will may be taken as in some measure standing for the deed do you only, in return, take care to remember me amid your breakfasts and delightful dinners because it is more proper to be your slave, than the master of others. Pray for me. </p>

<h2>Letter 4</h2>

<p class="subh">To the Same, on His Wisdom and Gentleness.</p>

<p>The faithful exponent of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion so arranges all things that no place be found in future for transgressors: for what else do you, for instance, promise us by so great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of character, than that, all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> being laid aside, we should lead a blessed life? In this matter, I see that the greatest praise befits your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, because you have changed even an uninstructed mind by your exhortations, and drawn it over to an excellent condition. But it would not seem so wonderful, if you had simply strengthened <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> minds by instilling wisdom into them; for intelligent men have a sort of relationship to devotion, but rustic natures are not easily won over to the side of severity.  Just as those who shape the forms of animals out of stone, undertake a business of a pretty difficult kind, when they strike very hard rocks with their chisels, while those who make their attempts on substances of a softer nature feel that their hands are aided by the ease of fashioning these materials, and it is deemed proper that the labor of the workman; when difficult, should be held in the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, so, Sir, singular commendation ought so be given to you, because you have made unpolished and rustic minds, set free from the darkness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, both to think what is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and to understand what is divine.</p>

<p>No less is Xenocrates, by far the most learned of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, held in estimation, who succeeded by severe exhortations in having luxury conquered. For when a certain Polemo, heavy with wine, staggered openly out of a nocturnal revel at the time when his hearers were flocking to the school of Xenocrates, he, too, entered the place, and impudently took his seat among the crowd of <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, in that dress in which he had come forth from the banquet. A chaplet of flowers covered his head, and yet he did not feel ashamed that he would seem unlike all the others, because, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, indulgence in a long drinking-bout had upset his brains, which are the seat of reason. As the rest of those there present began to murmur grievously, because so unsuitable a hearer had found his way in among a multitude of men of letters, the master himself was not in the slightest degree disturbed, but, on the contrary, began to discourse on the science of morals, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of moderation. And so powerful <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the influence of the teacher that the mind of that impudent intruder was persuaded to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of modesty. First of all, then, Polemo, in utter confusion, took off the chaplet from his head, and professed himself a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. And in course of time he conformed himself so thoroughly to the duties implied in dignity, and surrendered himself so entirely to the exhibition of modesty, that a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> amendment of character threw a cloak over the habits of his former life. Now we admire this very thing in your instructions, that, without the use of any threats, and without having recourse to terrors of any kind, you have turned infatuated minds to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that even a badly ordered <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it preferable  to live well and happily with all, rather than to hold unrighteous opinions with a few.</p>

<h2>Letter 5</h2>

<p class="subh">To an Unknown Person, Entreating Him to Deal Gently with His Brother.</p>

<p>Although my lord and brother has already begged of your nobleness that you would see that Tutus should be most  safe, yet it has been allowed to me to commend the same person in a letter, in order that, by the petition being doubled, he may be held all the safer. For let it be granted that a youthful fault and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of a yet unsettled age has injured him, so as to inflict a stain on his early years; still one, who did not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what was due to right conduct, has gone wrong almost without contracting blame. For when he came to a right state of mind and to reflection, he understood on better thoughts that a theatrical life was to be condemned. However, he could not be completely cleared of his fault, unless he should wash its guilt away by the aid  of Deity, since, by the remedy obtained through the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, changing his views, he has denied himself the enjoyment of a less <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> place, and has withdrawn himself from the eyes of the people.</p>

<p> <em>Of the Master as Above.</em> </p>

<p>Since, therefore, both divine and state <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> do not permit a faithful body and sanctified minds to exhibit disgraceful though pleasing spectacles, and to set forth vulgar means of enjoyment, especially since an injury seems in some degree to accrue to the chaste dedication of one's self, in case any one who has been renewed by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should fall back upon his old licentiousness, it behooves your Excellency to show favor to good intentions, so that he who, by the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has entered on a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> duty, should not be forced to sink into the pitfall of the theatre. He does not, however, refuse compliance with the judgment of you all, if you enjoin other fitting actions on his part in behalf of the requirements of our common country. </p>

<h2>Letter 6</h2>

<p class="subh">To Salvius: a Complaint that the Country People Were Harassed, and Their Possessions Plundered.</p>

<p>Forensic excitement ought to be at full heat during the time of business in the law-courts; for it is fitting that the arms of industry, as it struggles daily, should display energetic movements. But when loud-toned eloquence has sounded a retreat, and has retired to peaceful groves and pleasant dwelling-places, it is right that one lay aside idle murmurs, and cease to utter ineffectual threats. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that palm-bearing steeds, when they have retired from the circus, rest with the utmost quietness in their stables. Neither constant <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> nor doubtful palms of victory distress them, but at length, haltered to the peaceful cribs, they now no longer stand in awe of the master urging them on, enjoying sweet oblivion of the restless rivalry which had prevailed. In like manner, let it delight the boastful soldier after his term of service is completed, to hang up his trophies, and patiently to bear the burden of age.</p>

<p>But I do not quite understand why you should take a delight in terrifying miserable husbandmen; and I do not comprehend why you wish to harass my rustics with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of want of sustenance;  as if, indeed, I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to console them, and to deliver them from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and to show them that there is not so great a reason to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> as you pretend. I confess that, while we were occupied in the plain, I was often frightened by the arms of your eloquence, but frequently I returned you corresponding blows, as far as I was able. I certainly learned along with you, by what right, and in what order, the husbandmen are demanded back, to whom a legal process is competent, and to whom the issue of a process is not competent. You say that the Volusians wished you brought back, and frequently, in your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, you repeat that you will withdraw the country people from my little keep; and you, the very man, as I hope and desire, bound to me by the ties of old relationship, now rashly threaten that, casting our agreement to the winds, you will lay hold upon my men. I ask of your illustrious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whether there is one law for advocates, and another for private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, whether one thing is just at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and quite another thing at Matarum.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you were ever lord of the Volusian property, since Dionysius is said to have preserved the right of possession to it, and he never wanted heirs; who, while he lived, was accustomed to hurl the envenomed jibes of his low language upon a multitude of individuals.  There was, at that time, one Porphyrius, the son of Zibberinus, and yet he was not properly named the son of Zibberinus. He kept hidden, by military service, the question as to his birth, and, that he might dispel the cloud from his forehead, he took part in officious services and willing acts of submission. He was much with me both at home and in the forum, having often employed me as his defender with my father, and as his advocate before the judge. Sometimes I even kept back Dionysius, feeling that he ought not, for the sake of twenty acres to discharge vulgar abuse upon Porphyrius.</p>

<p>See, here is the reason why your remarkable <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> threatened my agents, so that, though you are not the owner of the place, you everywhere make mention of my husbandmen. But if you give yourself out as the successor of Porphyrius, you must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the narrow space of twenty acres cannot certainly be managed by one cultivator, or, if mindful of your proper dignity and determined to maintain it, you shrink from naming yourself the heir of Porphyrius, it is certain and obvious that he can commence proceedings,  to whom the right of doing so belongs, so as to go to law with those who have no property in that land. But if you diligently look into the matter, you will see that the endeavor to recover it most especially devolves on me. Wherefore, my much esteemed lord and brother, it behooves you to be at peace, and to return to friendship with me, while you condescend to come to a private conference. Cease, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, to disturb inactive and easily frightened <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and utter your boastful words at a distance. Believe me, however, that I am delighted with your high spirit, and by no means offended; for we are neither of a harsh disposition, nor destitute of learning. Let Maximinus at least render you gentle. </p>

<h2>Letter 7</h2>

<p class="subh">To an Unknown Person, Begging the Favor of a Letter.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, remain, but this should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the evidence of a letter, in order that an increase of affection may be gained by such mutual courtesy. For just as a fertile field cannot bring forth abundant fruits, if its cultivation has been neglected, and the good qualities of soil are lost through the indolence of one who rests, instead of working, so I think that the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and kindly feelings of the mind grow feeble, unless those who are absent are visited, as if present, by means of a letter. </p>
