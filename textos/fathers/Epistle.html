<h1>Epistle</h1>

<p><strong>In Name of the Synod of Antioch, Against Paul of Samosata.</strong></p>

<p>To Dionysius and Maximus, and to all our fellows in the ministry throughout the world, both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and to the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under heaven, Helenus and Hymenaeus and Theophilus and Theotecnus and Maximus, Proclus, Nicomas, and Aelianus, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Bolanus and Protogenes and Hierax and Eutychius and Theodorus and Malchion and Lucius, and all the others who are with us, dwelling in the neighbouring cities and nations, both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, together with the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, send greeting to our brethren beloved in the Lord.</p>

<p>1. After some few introductory words, they proceed thus:&mdash; We wrote to many of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, even those who live at a distance, and exhorted them to give their help in relieving us from this deadly doctrine; among these, we addressed, for instance, Dionysius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, and Firmilian of Cappadocia, those men of blessed name. Of these, the one wrote to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> without even deigning to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the leader in this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by addressing him; nor did he write to him in his own name, but to the whole district,  of which letter we have also subjoined a copy. And Firmilian, who came twice in person, condemned the innovations in doctrine, as we who were present <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and as many others <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as well as we. But when he (<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>) promised to give up these opinions, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him; and hoping that, without any reproach to the Word, the matter would be rightly settled, he postponed his decision; in which action, however, he was deceived by that denier of his God and Lord, and betrayer of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he formerly held. And now Firmilian was minded to cross to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; and he came as far as Tarsus, as having already made trial of the man's <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a>  iniquity. But when we had just assembled, and were calling for him and waiting for his arrival, his end came upon him.</p>

<p>2. After other matters again, they tell us in the following terms of what manner of life he was:&mdash; But there is no need of judging his actions when he was outside (the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>), when he revolted from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and turned aside to spurious and illegitimate doctrines. Nor need we say any thing of such matters as this, that, whereas he was formerly poor and beggarly, having neither inherited a single possession from his fathers, nor acquired any property by art or by any trade, he has now come to have excessive <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> by his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of iniquity and sacrilege, and by those means by which he despoils and concusses the brethren, casting the injured unfairly in their suit,  and promising to help them for a price, yet deceiving them all the while and to their loss, taking advantage of the readiness of those in difficulties to give in order to get deliverance from what troubled them, and thus supposing that gain is godliness.  Neither need I say any thing about his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and the haughtiness with which he assumed worldly dignities, and his wishing to be styled <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> <span class="stiki" id="note061357"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:5</a></span> rather than <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and his strutting through the market-places, and reading letters and reciting them  as he walked in public, and his being escorted by multitudes of people going before him and following him; so that he brought ill-will and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> demeanour and by the arrogance of his heart. Nor shall I say any thing of the quackery which he practises in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> assemblies, in the way of courting popularity and making a great parade, and astounding by such arts the minds of the less sophisticated; nor of his setting up for himself a lofty tribunal and throne, so unlike a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Christ; nor of his having a secretum  and calling it by that name, after the manner of the rulers of this world; nor of his striking his thigh with his hand and beating the tribunal with his feet; nor of his censuring and insulting those who did not applaud him nor shake their handkerchiefs,  as is done in the theatres, nor bawl out and leap about after the manner of his partisans, both male and female, who were such disorderly listeners to him, but chose to hear reverently and modestly as in the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor of his unseemly and violent attacks in the congregation upon the expounders of the Word who have already departed this life, and his magnifying of himself, not like a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but like a sophist and juggler; nor of his putting a stop to the psalms sung in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, as the recent compositions of recent men, and preparing <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to sing psalms in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of himself in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. in the great day of the Paschal festival, which choristers one might shudder to hear. And besides, he acted on those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, who fawned upon him in the neighbouring districts and cities, to advance the like opinions in their discourses to their people.</p>

<p>3. For we may say, to anticipate a little what we intend to write below, that he does not wish to acknowledge that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> came down from heaven. And this is a statement which shall not be made to depend on simple assertion; for it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> abundantly by those memoranda which we sent you, and not least by that passage in which he says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is from below. And they who sing his praise and eulogise him among the people, declare that their impious teacher has come down as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven. And such utterances the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> man does not check, but is present even when they are made. And then again there are these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>&mdash; these adopted sisters,  as the people of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> call them&mdash; who are kept by him and by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> with him, whose incurable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in this and other matters, though he is cognisant of them, and has convicted them, he connives at concealing, with the view of keeping the men subservient to himself, and preventing them, by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for their own position, from daring to accuse him in the matter of his impious words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Besides this, he has made his followers rich, and for that he is loved and admired by those who set their hearts on these things. But why should we write of these things? For, beloved, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>  ought to be an example in all good works to the people. Nor are we <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the fact that many have fallen away through introducing these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> into their houses, while others have fallen under suspicion. So that, even although one should admit that he has been doing nothing disgrace fill in this matter, yet he ought at least to have avoided the suspicion that springs out of such a course of conduct. lest perchance some might be offended, or find inducement to imitate him. For how, then, should any one censure another, or warn him to beware of yielding to greater familiarity with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, lest perchance he might slip, as it is written:  if, although he has dismissed one, he has still retained two with him, and these in the bloom of their youth, and of fair countenance; and if when he goes away he takes them with him; and all this, too, while he indulges in luxury and surfeiting?</p>

<p>4. And on account of these things all are groaning and lamenting with themselves; yet they have such a dread of his tyranny and power that they cannot venture on accusing him. And of these things, as we have said already, one might take account in the case of a man who held <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sentiments and belonged to our own number; but as to one who has betrayed  the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> (of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>), and who swaggers  with the abominable <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Artemas,&mdash; for why should we hesitate to disclose his father?&mdash; we consider it unnecessary to exact of him an account for these things.</p>

<p>5. <em>Then at the close of the epistle they add the following words</em>:&mdash; We have been compelled, therefore, to excommunicate this man, who thus opposes God Himself, and refuses submission, and to appoint in his place another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and that, as we trust, by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God&mdash; namely, the son of Demetrianus, a man of blessed memory, and one who presided over the same Church with distinction in former times, Domnus by name, a man endowed with all the noble qualities which become a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. And this fact we have communicated to you in order that you may write him, and receive letters of communion  from him. And that other may write to Artemas, if it please him; and those who think with Artemas may hold communion with him, if they are so minded.</p>
