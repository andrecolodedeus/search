<h1>Epistle 10</h1>

<p><strong>To the Martyrs and Confessors Who Sought that Peace Should Be Granted to the Lapsed.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; The Occasion of This Letter is Given Below in Epistle XIV. As Follows:&mdash; When I Found that Those Who Had Polluted Their Hands and Mouths with Sacrilegious Contact, or Had No Less Infected Their Conscience with Wicked Certificates, Etc.</em> </p>

<p>1. Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and confessors, his beloved brethren, greeting. The anxiety of my situation and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord constrain me, my brave and beloved brethren, to admonish you in my letters, that those who so devotedly and bravely maintain the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Lord should also maintain the law and discipline of the Lord. For while it behooves all Christ's soldiers to keep the precepts of their commander; to you it is more especially fitting that you should <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> His precepts, inasmuch as you have been made an example to others, both of valour and of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And I had indeed <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> who are there present with you would admonish and instruct you more fully concerning the law of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, as was the case always in time past under my predecessors; so that the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> passing in and out of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> controlled the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> by their counsels, and by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> precepts. But now, with great sorrow of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, I gather that not only the divine precepts are not suggested to you by them, but that they are even rather restrained, so that those things which are done by you yourselves, both in respect of God with caution, and in respect of God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>  with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, are relaxed by certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, who consider neither the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God nor the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Although you sent letters to me in which you ask that your wishes should be examined, and that peace should be granted to certain of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> as soon as with the end of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> we should have begun to meet with our <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and to be gathered together once more; those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> law, contrary also to your respectful petition, before penitence was fulfilled, before confession even of the gravest and most heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was made, before hands were placed upon the repentant by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, dare to offer on their behalf, and to give them the eucharist, that is, to profane the sacred body of the Lord, although it is written, <q>Whosoever shall eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052178"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:27</a></span> </p>

<p>2. And to the lasped indeed pardon may be granted in respect of this thing. For what dead person would not hasten to be made alive? Who would not be eager to attain to his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? But it is the duty of those placed over them to keep the ordinance, and to instruct those that are either hurrying or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, that those who ought to be shepherds of the sheep may not become their butchers. For to concede those things which tend to destruction is to deceive. Nor is the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> raised in this manner, but, by offending <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he is more urged on to ruin. Let them learn, therefore, even from you, what they ought to have taught; let them reserve your petitions and wishes for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>,  and let them wait for ripe and peaceable times to give peace at your requests. The first thing is, that the Mother should first receive peace from the Lord, and then, in accordance with your wishes, that the peace of her children should be considered.</p>

<p>3. And since I hear, most brave and beloved brethren, that you are pressed by the shamelessness of some, and that your modesty suffers <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>; I beg you with what entreaties I may, that, as mindful of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and considering what and what sort of things in past time your predecessors the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> conceded, how careful they were in all respects, you also should anxiously and cautiously weigh the wishes of those who petition you, since, as friends of the Lord, and hereafter to exercise judgment with Him, you must inspect both the conduct and the doings and the deserts of each one. You must consider also the kinds and qualities of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, lest, in the event of anything being abruptly and unworthily either promised by you or done by me, our Church  should begin to blush, even before the very <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For we are visited and chastened frequently, and we are admonished, that the commandments of the Lord may be kept without corruption or violation, which I find does not cease to be the case there among you so as to prevent the divine judgment from instructing very many of you also in the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now this can all be done, if you will regulate those things that are asked of you with a careful consideration of religion, perceiving and restraining those who, by accepting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, either make favours in distributing your benefits, or seek to make a profit of an unlawful trade.</p>

<p>4. Concerning this I have written both to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and to the people, both of which letters I have directed to be read to you. But you ought also to bring back and amend that matter according to your diligence, in such a way as to designate those by name to whom you desire that peace should be granted. For I hear that certificates are so given to some as that it is said, <q>Let such a one be received to communion along with his friends,</q> which was never in any case done by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> so that a vague and blind petition should by and by heap reproach upon us. For it opens a wide door to say, <q>Such a one with his friends; </q>and twenty or thirty or more, may be presented to us, who may be asserted to be neighbours and connections, and freedmen and servants, of the man who receives the certificate. And for this reason I beg you that you will designate by name in the certificate those whom you yourselves see, whom you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, whose penitence you see to be very near to full satisfaction, and so direct to us letters in conformity with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and discipline. I bid you, very brave and beloved brethren, ever heartily in the Lord farewell; and have me in remembrance. Farewell.</p>
