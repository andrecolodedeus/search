<h1>Epistle 13</h1>

<p><strong>To the Clergy, Concerning Those Who are in Haste to Receive Peace. A.D. 250.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Peace Must Be Attained Through Penitence, and Penitence is Realized by Keeping the Commandments. They Who are Oppressed with Sickness, If They are Relieved by the Suffrages of the Martyrs, May Be Admitted to Peace; But Others are to Be Kept Back Until the Peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is Secured.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, his brethren, greeting. I have read your letter, beloved brethren, wherein you wrote that your wholesome counsel was not wanting to our brethren, that, laying aside all rash haste, they should manifest a religious patience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that when by His mercy we come together, we may debate upon all kinds of things, according to the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, especially since it is written, <q>Remember from whence you have fallen, and repent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052193"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse5">Revelation&nbsp;2:5</a></span> Now he repents, who, remembering the divine precept, with meekness and patience, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, deserves well of the Lord by his <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and his righteous works.</p>

<p>2. Since, however, you intimate that some are petulant, and eagerly urge their being received to communion, and have desired in this matter that some rule should be given by me to you, I think I have sufficiently written on this subject in the last letter that was sent to you, that they who have received a certificate from the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and can be assisted by their help with the Lord in respect of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if they begin to be oppressed with any sickness or risk; when they have made confession, and have received the imposition of hands on them by you in acknowledgment of their penitence, should be remitted to the Lord with the peace promised to them by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. But others who, without having received any certificate from the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, are <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>  (since this is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> not of a few, nor of one church, nor of one province, but of the whole world), must wait, in dependence on the protection of the Lord, for the public peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself. For this is suitable to the modesty and the discipline, and even the life of all of us, that the chief officers meeting together with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the presence also of the people who stand fast, to whom themselves, moreover, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is to be shown for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, we may be able to order all things with the religiousness of a common consultation.  But how irreligious is it, and mischievous, even to those themselves who are eager, that while such as are exiles, and driven from their country, and spoiled of all their property, have not yet returned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, some of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> should be hasty to anticipate even confessors themselves, and to enter into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> before them! If they are so over-anxious, they have what they require in their own power, the times themselves offering them freely more than they ask. The struggle is still going forward, and the strife is daily celebrated. If they <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and with constancy repent of what they have done, and the fervour of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> prevails, he who cannot be delayed may be crowned.  I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell; and have me in remembrance. Greet all the brotherhood in my name, and tell them to be mindful of me. Farewell.</p>
