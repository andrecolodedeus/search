<h1>Epistle 15</h1>

<p><strong>To Moyses and Maximus, and the Rest of the Confessors.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; The Burden of This Letter is Given in Epistle XXXI. Below, Where the Roman Clergy Say: <q>On Which Subject We Owe You, and Give You Our Deepest and Abundant Thanks, that You Threw Light into the Gloom of Their Prison by Your Letters.</q></em> </p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Moyses and Maximus, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and the other confessors, his brethren, greeting. Celerinus, a companion both of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and God's soldier in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> engagements, has come to me, beloved brethren, and represented all of you, as well as each individual, forcibly to my affection. I beheld in him, when he came, the whole of you; and when he spoke sweetly and often of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to me, in his words I heard you. I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> very greatly when such things are brought to me from you by such men as he. In a certain manner I am also there with you in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. I think that I who am thus bound to your hearts, enjoy with you the delights of the divine approval. Your individual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> associates me with your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; the Spirit does not allow our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to be separated. Confession  shuts <em>you</em> up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; affection shuts <em>me</em> up there. And I indeed, remembering you day and night, both when in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> I offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with many, and when in retirement I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with private petition, beseech of the Lord a full acknowledgment to your crowns and your praises. But my poor ability is too weak to recompense you; you give more when you remember me in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, since, already breathing only celestial things, and meditating only divine things, you ascend to loftier heights, even by the delay of your suffering; and by the long lapse of time, are not wasting, but increasing your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. A first and single confession makes blessed; you confess as often as, when asked to retire from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, you prefer the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; your praises are as numerous as the days; as the months roll onward, ever your merits increase. He conquers once who suffers at once; but he who continues always battling with punishments, and is not overcome with suffering, is daily crowned.</p>

<p>2. Now, therefore, let magistrates and consuls or proconsuls go by; let them <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the ensigns of their yearly dignity, and in their twelve fusees. Behold, the heavenly dignity in you is sealed by the brightness of a year's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and already, in the continuance of its victorious <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, has passed over the rolling circle of the returning year. The rising sun and the waning moon enlightened the world; but to you, He who made the sun and moon was a greater light in your dungeon, and the brightness of Christ glowing in your hearts and minds, irradiated with that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and brilliant light the gloom of the place of punishment, which to others was so horrible and deadly. The winter has passed through the vicissitudes of the months; but you, shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, were undergoing, instead of the inclemencies of winter, the winter of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. To the winter succeeded the mildness of spring, rejoicing with roses and crowned with flowers; but to you were present roses and flowers from the delights of paradise, and celestial garlands wreathed your brows. Behold, the summer is fruitful with the fertility of the harvest, and the threshing-floor is filled with grain; but you who have sown <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, reap the fruit of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and, placed in the Lord's threshing-floor, behold the chaff burnt up with unquenchable fire; you yourselves as grains of wheat, winnowed and precious grain, now purged and garnered, regard the dwelling-place of a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> as your granary. Nor is there wanting to the autumn spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for discharging the duties of the season. The vintage is pressed out of doors, and the grape which shall hereafter flow into the cups is trodden in the presses. You, rich bunches out of the Lord's vineyard, and branches with fruit already ripe, trodden by the tribulation of worldly pressure, fill your wine-press in the torturing <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and shed your blood instead of wine; brave to bear suffering, you willingly drink the cup of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Thus the year rolls on with the Lord's servants&mdash;thus is celebrated the vicissitude of the seasons with spiritual deserts, and with celestial rewards.</p>

<p>3. Abundantly blessed are they who, from your number, passing through these footprints of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, have already departed from the world; and, having finished their journey of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, have attained to the embrace and the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of the Lord, to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the Lord Himself. But yet your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is not less, who are still engaged in contest, and, about to follow the glories of your comrades, are long waging the battle, and with an unmoved and unshaken <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> standing fast, are daily exhibiting in your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> a spectacle in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The longer is your strife, the loftier will be your crown. The struggle is one, but it is crowded with a manifold multitude of contests; you conquer hunger, and despise thirst, and tread under foot the squalor of the dungeon, and the horror of the very abode of punishment, by the vigour of your <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. Punishment is there subdued; torture is worn out; death is not feared but desired, being overcome by the reward of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, so that he who has conquered is crowned with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of life. What now must be the mind in you, how elevated, how large the heart, when such and so great things are resolved, when nothing but the precepts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the rewards of Christ are considered! The will is then only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; and although you are still placed in the flesh, it is the life not of the present world, but of the future, that you now live.</p>

<p>4. It now remains, beloved brethren, that you should be mindful of me; that, among your great and divine considerations, you should also think of me in your mind and spirit; and that I should be in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications, when that voice, which is illustrious by the purification of confession, and praiseworthy for the continual tenor of its <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, penetrates to God's ears, and heaven being open to it, passes from these regions of the world subdued, to the realms above, and obtains from the Lord's goodness even what it asks. For what do you ask from the Lord's mercy which you do not deserve to obtain?&mdash; you who have thus observed the Lord's commands, who have maintained the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> discipline with the simple vigour of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who, with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> uncorrupted, have stood bravely by the Lord's commands, and by His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and have confirmed the wavering <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of many by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of your <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>? Truly, <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> witnesses, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, Christ's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, resting upon His roots, founded with strong foundation upon the Rock, you have joined discipline with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, you have brought others to the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have made your <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, examples. I bid you, brethren, very brave and beloved, ever heartily farewell; and remember me.</p>
