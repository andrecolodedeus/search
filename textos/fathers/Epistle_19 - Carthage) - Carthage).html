<h1>Epistle 19</h1>

<p><strong>Cyprian Replies to Caldonius.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian Treats of Nothing Peculiar in This Epistle, Beyond Acquiescing in the Opinion of Caldonius, to Wit, that Peace Should Not Be Refused to Such Lapsed As, by a True Repentance and Confession of the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Have Deserved It, and Have Therefore Returned to Him.</em></p>

<p>Cyprian to Caldonius, his brother, greeting. We have received your letter, beloved brother, which is abundantly sensible, and full of honesty and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Nor do we wonder that, skilled and exercised as you are in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the Lord, you do everything discreetly and wisely. You have judged quite correctly about granting peace to our brethren, which they, by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> penitence and by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of a confession of the Lord, have restored to themselves, being justified by their words, by which before they had condemned themselves. Since, then, they have washed away all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and their former stain, by the help of the Lord, has been done away by a more powerful <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, they ought not to lie any longer under the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as it were, prostrate; when, being banished and deprived of all their property, they have lifted themselves up and have begun to stand with Christ. And I wish that the others also would repent after their fall, and be transferred into their former condition; and that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how we have dealt with these, in their urgent and eager rashness and importunity to extort peace, I have sent a book  to you, with letters to the number of five, that I wrote to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and to the people, and to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> also and confessors, which letters have already been sent to many of our colleagues, and have satisfied them; and they replied that they also agree with me in the same opinion according to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; which very thing do you also communicate to as many of our colleagues as you can, that among all these, may be observed one mode of action and one agreement, according to the Lord's precepts.  I bid you, beloved brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>
