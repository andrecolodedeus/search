<h1>Epistle 22</h1>

<p><strong>To the Clergy Abiding at Rome, Concerning Many of the Confessors, and Concerning the Forwardness of Lucian and the Modesty of Celerinus the Confessor.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; In This Letter Cyprian Informs the Roman Clergy of the Seditious Demand of the Lapsed to Be Restored to Peace, and of the Forwardness of Lucian. In Order that They May Better Understand These Matters, Cyprian Takes Care that Not Only His Own Letters, But Also Those of Celerinus and Lucian, Should Be Sent to Them.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> abiding at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, his brethren, greeting. After the letters that I wrote to you, beloved brethren, in which what I had done was explained, and some slight account was given of my discipline and diligence, there came another matter which, any more than the others, ought not to be concealed from you. For our brother Lucian, who himself also is one of the confessors, earnest indeed in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and robust in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but little established in the reading of the Lord's word, has attempted certain things, constituting himself for a time an authority for unskilled people, so that certificates written by his hand were given indiscriminately to many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the name of Paulus; whereas Mappalicus the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, cautious and modest, mindful of the law and discipline, wrote no letters contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, but only, moved with domestic affection for his mother,  who had fallen, commanded peace to be given to her. Saturninus, moreover, after his torture, still remaining in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, sent out no letters of this kind. But Lucian, not only while Paulus was still in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, gave everywhere in his name certificates written with his own hand, but even after his decease persisted in doing the same things under his name, saying that this had been commanded him by Paulus, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that he must <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the Lord rather than his fellow-servant. In the name also of Aurelius, a young man who had undergone the torture, many certificates were given, written by the hand of the same Lucian, because Aurelius did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to write himself.</p>

<p>2. In order, in some measure, to put a stop to this practice, I wrote letters to them, which I have sent to you under the enclosure of the former letter, in which I did not fail to ask and persuade them that consideration might be had for the law of the Lord and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. But after I sent my letters to them, that, as it were, something might be done more moderately and temperately; the same Lucian wrote a letter in the name of all the confessors, in which well near every bond of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Lord's command, and the sacredness and sincerity of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> were dissolved. For he wrote in the name of all, that they had given peace to all, and that he wished that this decree should be communicated through me to the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, of which letter I transmitted a copy to you. It was added indeed, <q>of whom the account of what they have done since their crime has been satisfactory; </q>&mdash; a thing this which excites a greater odium against me, because I, when I have begun to hear the cases of each one and to examine into them, seem to deny to many what they now are all boasting that they have received from the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and confessors.</p>

<p>3. Finally, this seditious practice has already begun to appear; for in our province, through some of its cities, an attack has been made by the multitude upon their rulers, and they have compelled that peace to be given to them immediately which they all cried out had been once given to them by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and confessors. Their rulers, being frightened and subdued, were of little avail to resist them, either by vigour of mind or by strength of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. With us, moreover, some turbulent spirits, who in time past were with difficulty governed by me, and were delayed till my coming, were inflamed by this letter as if by a firebrand, and began to be more violent, and to extort the peace granted to them. I have sent a copy to you of the letters that I wrote to my <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> about these matters, and, moreover, what Caldonius, my colleague, of his integrity and faithfulness wrote, and what I replied to him. I have sent both to you to read. Copies also of the letter of Celerinus, the good and stout confessor, which he wrote to Lucian the same confessor&mdash; also what Lucian replied to him&mdash;I have sent to you; that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both my labour in respect of everything, and my diligence, and might learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, how moderate and cautious is Celerinus the confessor, and how reverent both in his humility and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; while Lucian, as I have said, is less skilful concerning the understanding of the Lord's word, and by his facility, is mischievous on account of the dislike that he causes for my reverential dealing. For while the Lord has said that the nations are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and their past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are to be done away in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; this man, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the precept and of the law, commands peace to be granted and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be done away in the name of Paulus; and he says that this was commanded him by Paulus, as you will observe in the letter sent by the same Lucian to Celerinus, in which he very little considered that it is not <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> that make the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, but that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are made by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>;  since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also, the apostle whom the Lord called a chosen vessel unto Him, laid down in his epistle: <q>I marvel that you are so soon removed from Him that called you into the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, unto another gospel: which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But though we, or an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received, let him be accursed.</q> </p>

<p>4. But your letter, which I received, written to my <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, came opportunely; as also did those which the blessed confessors, Moyses and Maximus, Nicostratus, and the rest, sent to Saturninus and Aurelius, and the others, in which are contained the full vigour of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the robust discipline of the law of the Lord. Your words much assisted me as I laboured here, and withstood with the whole strength of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the onset of ill-will, so that my work was shortened from above, and that before the letters which I last sent you reached you, you declared to me, that according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> law, your judgment also strongly and unanimously concurred with mine. I bid you, brethren, beloved and longed-for, ever heartily farewell.</p>
