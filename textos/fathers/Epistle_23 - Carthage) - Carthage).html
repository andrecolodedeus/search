<h1>Epistle 23</h1>

<p><strong>To the Clergy, on the Letters Sent to Rome, and About the Appointment of Saturus as Reader, and Optatus as Sub-Deacon. A.D. 250.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; The Clergy are Informed by This Letter of the Ordination of Saturus and Optatus, and What Cyprian Had Written to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</em></p>

<p>Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, his brethren, greeting. That nothing may be unknown to your consciousness, beloved brethren, of what was written to me and what I replied, I have sent you a copy of each letter, and I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that my rejoinder will not displease you. But I ought to acquaint you in my letter concerning this, that for a very urgent reason I have sent a letter to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who abide in the city. And since it behooved me to write by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, while I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that very many of ours are absent, and the few that are there are hardly sufficient for the ministry of the daily duty, it was necessary to appoint some new ones, who might be sent. Know, then, that I have made Saturus a reader, and Optatus, the confessor, a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacon</a>; whom already, by the general advice, we had made next to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, in having entrusted to Saturus on Easter-day, once and again, the reading; and when with the teacher-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>  we were carefully trying readers&mdash; in appointing Optatus from among the readers to be a teacher of the hearers&mdash;examining, first of all, whether all things were found fitting in them, which ought to be found in such as were in preparation for the clerical office. Nothing new, therefore, has been done by me in your absence; but what, on the general advice of all of us had been begun, has, upon urgent necessity, been accomplished. I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell; and remember me. Farewell.</p>
