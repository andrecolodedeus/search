<h1>Epistle 24</h1>

<p><strong>To Moyses and Maximus and the Rest of the Confessors.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; This Letter is One of Congratulation to the Roman Confessors.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Moyses and Maximus, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and to the other confessors, his very beloved brethren, greeting. I had already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from rumour, most brave and blessed brethren, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, rejoicing greatly and abundantly congratulating you, that the highest condescension of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> should have prepared you for the crown by confession of His name. For you, who have become chiefs and leaders in the battle of our day, have set forward the standard of the celestial warfare; you have made a beginning of the spiritual contest which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has purposed to be now waged by your valour; you, with unshaken strength and unyielding firmness, have broken the first onset of the rising <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Thence have arisen <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> openings of the fight; thence have begun good auspices of victory. It happened that here <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> were consummated by tortures. But he who, preceding in the struggle, has been made an example of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to the brethren, is on common ground with the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Hence you have delivered to us garlands woven by your hand, and have pledged your brethren from the cup of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>2. To these <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> beginnings of confession and the omens of a victorious warfare, has been added the maintenance of discipline, which I observed from the vigour of your letter that you lately sent to your colleagues joined with you to the Lord in confession, with anxious admonition, that the sacred precepts of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the commandments of life once delivered to us should be kept with firm and rigid observance. Behold another lofty degree of your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; behold, with confession, a double title to deserving well of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;to stand with a firm step, and to drive away in this struggle, by the strength of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, those who endeavour to make a breach in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and bring impious hands to the work of undermining the Lord's precepts:&mdash; to have before afforded the indications of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and now to afford lessons of life. The Lord, when, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, He sent forth His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, charges them, saying, <q>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go therefore, and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052244"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;28:18-20</a></span> And the Apostle John, remembering this charge, subsequently lays it down in his epistle: <q>Hereby,</q> says he, <q>we do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, if we keep His commandments. He that says he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him, and keeps not His commandments, is a liar, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052245"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:3-4</a></span> You prompt the keeping of these precepts; you observe the divine and heavenly commands. This is to be a confessor of the Lord; this is to be a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash;to keep the firmness of one's profession inviolate among all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and secure.  For to wish to become a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the Lord, and to try to overthrow the Lord's precepts; to use against Him the condescension that He has granted you&mdash;to become, as it were, a rebel with arms that you have received from Him&mdash;this is to wish to confess Christ, and to deny Christ's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, therefore, on your behalf, most brave and faithful brethren; and as much as I congratulate the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> there honoured for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of their strength, so much do I also equally congratulate you for the crown of the Lord's discipline. The Lord has shed forth His condescension in manifold kinds of liberality. He has distributed the praises of good soldiers and their spiritual glories in plentiful variety. We also are sharers in your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; we count your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, whose times have been brightened by such a felicity, that it should be the fortune of our day to see the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Christ's soldiers crowned. I bid you, most brave and blessed brethren, ever heartily farewell; and remember me.</p>
