<h1>Epistle 25</h1>

<p><strong>Moyses, Maximus, Nicostratus, and the Other Confessors Answer the Foregoing Letter. A.D. 250.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; They Gratefully Acknowledge the Consolation Which the Roman Confessors Had Received from Cyprian's Letter. Martyrdom is Not a Punishment, But a Happiness. The Words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> are Brands to Inflame Faith. In the Case of the Lapsed, the Judgment of Cyprian is Acquiesced in.</em></p>

<p>1. To Caecilius Cyprian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church of the Carthaginians, Moyses and Maximus, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and Nicostratus and Rufinus, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and the other confessors persevering in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and in His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, greeting. Placed, brother, as we are among various and manifold sorrows, on account of the present desolations of many brethren throughout almost the whole world,  this chief consolation has reached us, that we have been lifted up by the receipt of your letter, and have gathered some alleviation for the griefs of our saddened spirit. From which we can already perceive that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> wished to keep us so long shut up in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> chains, perhaps for no other reason than that, instructed and more vigorously animated by your letter, we might with a more earnest will attain to the destined crown. For your letter has shone upon us as a calm in the midst of a tempest, and as the longed-for tranquillity in the midst of a troubled sea, and as repose in labours, as health in dangers and pains, as in the densest darkness, the bright and glowing light. Thus we drank it up with a thirsty spirit, and received it with a hungry desire; so that we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to find ourselves by it sufficiently fed and strengthened for encounter with the foe. The Lord will reward you for that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of yours, and will restore you the fruit due to this so good work; for he who exhorts is not less worthy of the reward of the crown than he who suffers; not less worthy of praise is he who has taught, than he who has acted also; he is not less to be honoured who has warned, than he who has fought; except that sometimes the weight of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> more redounds to him who trains, than to him who has shown himself a teachable learner; for the latter, perchance, would not have bad what he has practised, unless the former had taught him.</p>

<p>2. Therefore, again, we say, brother Cyprian, we have received great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, great comfort, great refreshment, especially in that you have described, with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and deserved praises, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, I will not say, deaths, but immortalities of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. For such departures should have been proclaimed with such words, that the things which were related might be told in such manner as they were done. Thus, from your letter, we saw those <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> triumphs of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; and with our eyes in some sort have followed them as they went to heaven, and have contemplated them seated among <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and the powers and dominions of heaven. Moreover, we have in some manner perceived with our ears the Lord giving them the promised testimony in the presence of the Father. It is this, then, which also raises our spirit day by day, and inflames us to the following of the track of such dignity.</p>

<p>3. For what more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, or what more blessed, can happen to any man from the divine condescension, than to confess the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, in death itself, before his very executioners? Than among the raging and varied and exquisite tortures of worldly power, even when the body is racked and torn and cut to pieces, to confess Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with a spirit still free, although departing? Than to have mounted to heaven with the world left behind? Than, having forsaken men, to stand among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>? Than, all worldly impediments being broken through, already to stand free in the sight of God? Than to enjoy the heavenly kingdom without any delay? Than to have become an associate of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> passion in Christ's name? Than to have become by the divine condescension the judge of one's own judge? Than to have brought off an unstained <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from the confession of His name? Than to have refused to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Than to have borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with a public testimony? Than, by dying, to have subdued death itself, which is dreaded by all? Than, by death itself, to have attained <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>? Than when torn to pieces, and tortured by all the instruments of cruelty, to have overcome the torture by the tortures themselves? Than by strength of mind to have wrestled with all the agonies of a mangled body? Than not to have shuddered at the flow of one's own blood? Than to have begun to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one's punishments, after having <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to bear them?  Than to think it an injury to one's life not to have left it?</p>

<p>4. For to this battle our Lord, as with the trumpet of His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, stimulates us when He says, <q>He that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loves his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> more than me is not worthy of me. And he that takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052250"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;10:37-38</a></span> And again, <q>Blessed are they which are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Blessed shall you be, when men shall <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for so did their fathers <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which were before you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052251"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;5:10-12</a></span> And again, Because you shall stand before kings and powers, and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the son, and he that endures to the end shall be saved;   and <q>To him that overcomes will I give to sit on my throne, even as I also overcame and am set down on the throne of my Father.</q>  Moreover the apostle: <q>Who shall separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As it is written, For your sake are we killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.) Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors for Him who has loved us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052254"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse35">Romans&nbsp;8:35</a></span> </p>

<p>5. When we read these things,  and things of the like kind, brought together in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and feel, as it were, torches placed under us, with the Lord's words to inflame our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we not only do not dread, but we even provoke  the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and we have already conquered the opponents of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the very fact of our not yielding to them, and have subdued their nefarious <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And although we have not yet shed our blood, we are prepared to shed it. Let no one think that this delay of our departure  is any clemency; for it obstructs us, it makes a hindrance to our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, it puts off heaven, it withholds the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For in a contest of this kind, and in the kind of contest when <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is struggling in the encounter, it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> clemency to put off <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> by delay. Entreat therefore, beloved Cyprian, that of His mercy the Lord will every day more and more arm and adorn every one of us with greater abundance and readiness, and will confirm and strengthen us by the strength of His power; and, as a good captain, will at length bring forth His soldiers, whom He has hitherto trained and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the camp of our <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, to the field of the battle set before them. May He hold forth to us the divine arms, those weapons that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to be conquered&mdash;the breastplate of righteousness, which is never accustomed to be broken&mdash;the shield of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which cannot be pierced through&mdash;the helmet of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which cannot be shattered&mdash;and the sword of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which has never been wont to be injured. For to whom should we rather commit these things for him to ask for us, than to our so reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>,  as destined victims asking help of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>?</p>

<p>6. Behold another <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of ours, that, in the duty of your <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, although in the meantime you have been, owing to the condition of the times, divided from your brethren, you have frequently confirmed the confessors by your letters; that you have ever afforded necessary supplies from your own just acquisitions; that in all things you have always shown yourself in some sense present; that in no part of your duty have you hung behind as a deserter.  But what more strongly stimulated us to a greater <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> we cannot be silent upon, but must describe with all the testimony of our voice. For we observe that you have both rebuked with fitting censure, and worthily, those who, unmindful of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, had, with hasty and eager desire, extorted peace from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in your absence, and those who, without respect for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, had with profane facility granted the <em><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a></em>  of the Lord unto dogs, and pearls to swine; although a great crime, and one which has extended with incredible destructiveness almost over the whole earth, ought only, as you yourself write, to be treated cautiously and with moderation, with the advice of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, confessors, and even the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> who abide fast,  as in your letters you yourself also testify; so that, while wishing unseasonably to bring repairs to the ruins, we may not appear to be bringing about other and greater destruction, for where is the divine word left, if pardon be so easily granted to sinners? Certainly their spirits are to be cheered and to be nourished up to the season of their maturity, and they are to be instructed from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> how great and surpassing a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> they have committed. Nor let them be animated by the fact that they are many, but rather let them be checked by the fact that they are not few.  An unblushing number has never been accustomed to have weight in extenuation of a crime; but shame, modesty, patience, discipline, humility, and subjection, waiting for the judgment of others upon itself, and bearing the sentence of others upon its own judgment,&mdash; this it is which proves penitence; this it is which skins over a deep wound; this it is which raises up the ruins of the fallen spirit and restores them, which quells and restrains the burning vapour of their raging <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For the physician will not give to the sick the food of healthy bodies, lest the unseasonable nourishment, instead of repressing, should stimulate the power of the raging disease&mdash;that is to say, lest what might have been sooner diminished by abstinence, should, through impatience, be prolonged by growing indigestion.</p>

<p>7. Hands, therefore, polluted with impious <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>  must be purified with good works, and wretched mouths defiled with accursed food  must be purged with words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> penitence, and the spirit must be renewed and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the recesses of the faithful heart. Let the frequent groanings of the penitents be heard; let faithful tears be shed from the eyes not once only, but again and again, so that those very eyes which wickedly looked upon <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> may wash away, with tears that satisfy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the unlawful things that they had done. Nothing is necessary for diseases but patience: they who are weary and weak wrestle with their pain; and so at length hope for health, if, by tolerating it, they can overcome their suffering; for unfaithful is the scar which the physician has too quickly produced; and the healing is undone by any little casualty, if the remedies be not used faithfully from their very slowness. The flame is quickly recalled again to a conflagration, unless the material of the whole fire be extinguished even to the extremest spark; so that men of this kind should <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that even they themselves are more advantaged by the very delay, and that more trusty remedies are applied by the necessary postponement. Besides, where shall it be said that they who confess Christ are shut up in the keeping of a squalid <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, if they who have denied Him are in no peril of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Where, that they are bound in the cincture of chains in God's name, if they who have not kept the confession of God are not deprived of communion? Where, that the imprisoned <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> lay down their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> lives, if those who have forsaken the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> do not feel the magnitude of their dangers and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? But if they betray too much impatience, and demand communion with intolerable eagerness, they vainly utter with petulant and unbridled tongues those querulous and invidious reproaches which avail nothing against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since they might have retained by their own right what now by a necessity, which they of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> have sought, they are compelled to sue for.  For the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which could confess Christ, could also have been kept by Christ in communion. We bid you, blessed and most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> father, ever heartily farewell in the Lord; and have us in remembrance.</p>
