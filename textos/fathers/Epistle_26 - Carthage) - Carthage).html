<h1>Epistle 26</h1>

<p><strong>Cyprian to the Lapsed.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; The Argument of This Letter is Found Below in Letter XXVII. <q>They Wrote to Me,</q> Says He, <q>Not Asking that Peace Should Be Granted Them, But Claiming It for Themselves as Already Granted, Because They Say that Paulus Has Given Peace to All; As You Will Read in Their Letter of Which I Have Sent You a Copy, Together with What I Briefly Replied to Them</q> But the Letter of the Lapsed to Which He Replies is Wanting.</em></p>

<p>1. Our Lord, whose precepts and admonitions we ought to observe, describing the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>  and the order of His Church, speaks in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and says to Peter: <q>I say unto you, That you are Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church; and the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto you the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>: and whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</q>  Thence, through the changes of times and successions, the ordering of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the plan of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> flow onwards; so that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is founded upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and every act of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is controlled by these same rulers.  Since this, then, is founded on the divine law, I marvel that some, with daring temerity, have chosen to write to me as if they wrote in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is established in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and all who stand <em>fast in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>. For far be it from the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His uncontrolled might to suffer the number of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> to be called the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; since it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the dead, but of the living.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052270"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;22:32</a></span> For we indeed desire that all may be made alive; and we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that, by our supplications and groans, they may be restored to their original state. But if certain lapsed ones claim to be the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be among them and in them, what is left but for us to ask of these very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that they would deign to admit us into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Therefore it behooves them to be submissive and quiet and modest, as those who ought to appease <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in remembrance of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and not to write letters in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when they should rather be aware that they are writing to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>2. But some who are of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> have lately written to me, and are <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and meek and trembling and fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who have always laboured in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> and liberally, and who have never made a boast of their labour to the Lord, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that He has said, <q>When you shall have done all these things, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052271"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;17:10</a></span> Thinking of which things, and although they had received certificates from the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, nevertheless, that their satisfaction might be admitted by the Lord, these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> beseeching have written to me that they acknowledge their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> repentant, and do not hurry rashly or importunately to secure peace; but that they are waiting for my presence, saying that even peace itself, if they should receive it when I was present, would be sweeter to them. How greatly I congratulate these, the Lord is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, who has condescended to tell what such, and such sort of servants deserve of His kindness. Which letters, as I lately received, and now read that you have written very differently, I beg that you will discriminate between your wishes; and whoever you are who have sent this letter, add your names to the certificate, and transmit the certificate to me with your several names. For I must first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to whom I have to reply; then I will respond to each of the matters that you have written, having regard to the mediocrity of my place and conduct. I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell, and live quietly and tranquilly according to the Lord's discipline. Farewell.</p>
