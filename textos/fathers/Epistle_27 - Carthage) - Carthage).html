<h1>Epistle 27</h1>

<p><strong>To the Presbyters and Deacons.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; The Argument of This Letter is Sufficiently in Agreement with the Preceding, and It Appears that It is the One of Which He Speaks in the Following Letter; For He Praises His Clergy for Having Rejected from Communion Gaius of Didda, a Presbyter, and His Deacon, Who Rashly Communicated with the Lapsed; And Exhorts Them to Do the Same with Certain Others.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, his brethren, greeting. You have done uprightly and with discipline, beloved brethren, that, by the advice of my colleagues who were present, you have decided not to communicate with Gaius the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Didda, and his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>; who, by communicating with the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, and offering their oblations,  have been frequently taken in their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>; and who once and again, as you wrote to me, when warned by my colleagues not to do this, have persisted obstinately, in their presumption and audacity, deceiving certain brethren also from among our people, whose benefit we desire with all humility to consult, and whose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> we take care for, not with affected adulation, but with sincere <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that they may supplicate the Lord with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> penitence and groaning and sorrow, since it is written, <q>Remember from whence you are fallen, and repent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052274"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse5">Revelation&nbsp;2:5</a></span> And again, the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> says, <q>Thus says the Lord, When you shall be converted and lament, then you shall be saved, and shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> where you have been.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052275"><a href="../bible/isa030.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;30:15</a></span> </p>

<p>2. Yet how can those mourn and repent, whose groanings and tears some of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> obstruct when they rashly think that they may be communicated with, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is written, <q>They who call you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>  <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, and destroy the path of your feet? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052277"><a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;3:12</a></span> Naturally, our wholesome and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> counsels have no success, while the salutary <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is hindered by mischievous blandishments and flatteries, and the wounded and unhealthy mind of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> suffers what those also who are bodily diseased and sick often suffer; that while they refuse wholesome food and beneficial drink as bitter and distasteful, and crave those things which seem to please them and to be sweet for the present, they are inviting to themselves mischief and death by their recklessness and intemperance. Nor does the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> remedy of the skilful physician avail to their safety, while the sweet enticement is deceiving with its charms.</p>

<p>3. Do you, therefore, according to my letters, take counsel about this faithfully and wholesomely, and do not recede from better counsels; and be careful to read these same letters to my colleagues also, if there are any present, or if any should come to you; that, with unanimity and concord, we may maintain a healthful plan for soothing and healing the wounds of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, intending to deal very fully with all when, by the Lord's mercy, we shall begin to assemble together. In the meantime, if any unrestrained and impetuous person, whether of our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> or of strangers, should dare, before our decree, to communicate with the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, let him be expelled from our communion, and plead the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his rashness before all of us when, by the Lord's permission, we shall assemble together again.  Moreover, you wished me to reply what I thought concerning Philumenus and Fortunatus, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacons</a>, and Favorinus, an acolyte, who retired in the midst of the time of trial, and have now returned. Of which thing I cannot make myself sole judge, since many of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are still absent, and have not considered, even thus late, that they should return to their place; and this case of each one must be considered separately and fully investigated, not only with my colleagues, but also with the whole of the people themselves.  For a matter which hereafter may constitute an example as regards the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be weighed and adjudged with careful deliberation. In the meanwhile, let them only abstain from the monthly division,  not so as to seem to be deprived of the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but that all matters being in a sound state, they may be reserved till my coming. I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell.Greet all the brotherhood, and farewell.</p>
