<h1>Epistle 29</h1>

<p><strong>The Presbyters and Deacons Abiding at Rome, to Cyprian.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; The Roman Church Declares Its Judgment Concerning the Lapsed to Be in Agreement with the Carthaginian Decrees. Any Indulgence Shown to the Lapsed is Required to Be in Accordance with the Law of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. That the Peace Granted by the Confessors Depends Only Upon Grace and Good-Will, is Manifest from the Fact that the Lapsed are Referred to the Bishops. The Seditious Demand for Peace Made by Felicissimus is to Be Attributed to Faction.</em></p>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> abiding at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to Father  Cyprian, greeting. When, beloved brother, we carefully read your letter which you had sent by Fortunatus the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacon</a>, we were smitten with a double sorrow, and disordered with a twofold grief, that there was not any rest given to you in such necessities of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and that the unreasonable petulance of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> brethren was declared to be carried even to a dangerous boldness of expression. But although those things which we have spoken of severely afflicted us and our spirit, yet your rigour and the severity that you have used, according to the proper discipline, moderates the so heavy load of our grief, in that you rightly restrain the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of some, and, by your exhortation to repentance, show the legitimate way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> That they should have wished to hurry to such an extreme as this, we are indeed considerably surprised; as that with such urgency, and at so unseasonable and bitter a time, being in so great and excessive a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they should not so much ask for, as claim, peace for themselves; nay, should say that they already have it in heaven. If they have it, why do they ask for what they possess? But if, by the very fact that they are asking for it, it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that they have it not, wherefore do they not accept the judgment of those from whom they have thought fit to ask for the peace, which they certainly have not got? But if they think that they have from any other source the prerogative of communion, let them try to compare it with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that so at length it may abundantly avail them, if it is not out of harmony with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> law. But on what principle can that give <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> communion which seems to be established contrary to <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? For since every prerogative contemplates the privilege of association, precisely on the assumption of its not being out of harmony with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him with whom it seeks to be associated; then, because this is alien from His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> with whom it seeks to be associated, it must of necessity lose the indulgence and privilege of the association.</p>

<p>2. Let them, then, see what it is they are trying to do in this matter. For if they say that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has established one decree, but the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> have established another; then they, setting the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> at variance with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, will be in danger on both sides. For, on the one hand, the majesty of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> will already appear shattered and cast down, if it can be overcome by the novelty of another decree; and, on the other, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> crown of confession will be taken from the heads of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, if they be not found to have attained it by the observation of that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> whence they become <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; so that, reasonably, no one should be more careful to determine nothing contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, than he who strives to receive the name of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. We should like, besides, to be informed of this: if <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> become <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> for no other reason than that by not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> they may keep the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> even to the shedding of their own blood, lest, overcome by the suffering of the torture, by losing peace, they might lose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; on what principle do they think that the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which if they had <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> they thought that they should not have, was to be given to those who are said to have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>; although they ought to maintain that law in others. which they themselves appear to have held before their own eyes? In which thing we observe that they have put forward against their own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the very thing which they thought made for them. For if the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> thought that peace was to be granted to them, why did not they themselves grant it? Why did they think that, as they themselves say, they were to be referred to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>? For he who orders a thing to be done, can assuredly do that which he orders to be done. But, as we understand, nay, as the case itself speaks and proclaims, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> thought that a proper measure of modesty and of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must be observed on both sides. For as they were urged by many, in remitting them to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> they conceived that they would consult their own modesty so as to be no further disquieted; and in themselves not holding communion with them, they judged that the purity of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> law ought to be maintained unimpaired.</p>

<p>3. But of your charity, brother, never desist from soothing the spirits of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> and affording to the erring the medicine of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, although the temper of the sick is wont to reject the kind offices of those who would heal them. This wound of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> is as yet fresh, and the sore is still rising into a tumour; and therefore we are certain, that when, in the course of more protracted time, that urgency of theirs shall have worn out, they will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that very delay which refers them to a faithful medicine; if only there be not those who arm them for their own danger, and, instructing them perversely, demand on their behalf, instead of the salutary remedies of delay, the fatal poisons of a premature communion. For we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that without the instigation of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> they would all have dared so petulantly to claim peace for themselves. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Carthaginian church,  we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> her training, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> her humility; whence also we have marvelled that we should observe certain things somewhat rudely suggested against you by letter, although we have often become aware of your mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and charity, in many illustrations of reciprocal affection of one another. It is time, therefore, that they should repent of their fault, that they should prove their grief for their lapse, that they should show modesty, that they should manifest humility, that they should exhibit some shame, that, by their submission, they should appeal to God's clemency for themselves, and by due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for  God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should draw forth upon themselves the divine mercy. How vastly better would have been the letters of these men themselves, if the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of those who stood fast had been aided by their own humility! since that which is asked for is more easily obtained, when he for whom it is asked is worthy, that what is asked should be obtained.</p>

<p>4. In respect, however, of Privatus of Lambesa, you have acted as you usually do, in desiring to inform us of the matter, as being an object of anxiety; for it becomes us all to watch for the body of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose members are scattered through every various province.  But the deceitfulness of that crafty man could not be hid from us even before we had your letters; for previously, when from the company of that very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> a certain Futurus came, a standard-bearer of Privatus, and was desirous of fraudulently obtaining letters from us, we were neither <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> who he was, nor did he get the letters which he wanted. We bid you heartily farewell in the Lord.</p>
