<h1>Epistle 3</h1>

<p><strong>To the Presbyters and Deacons Abiding at Rome. A.D. 250.</strong> </p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; This is a Familiar and Friendly Epistle; So that It Requires No Formal Argument, Especially as It Can Be Sufficiently Gathered from the Title Itself. The Letter of the Roman Clergy, to Which Cyprian is Replying, is Missing.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to the elders and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, brethren abiding at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, sends, greeting. When the report of the departure of the excellent man, my colleague,  was still uncertain among us, my beloved brethren, and I was wavering doubtfully in my opinion on the matter, I received a letter sent to me from you by Crementius the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacon</a>, in which I was most abundantly informed of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> end; and I rejoiced greatly that, in harmony with the integrity of his administration, an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> consummation also attended him. Wherein, moreover, I greatly congratulate you, that you <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> his memory with a testimony so public and so illustrious, so that by your means is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me, not only what is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> to you in connection with the memory of your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but what ought to afford to me also an example of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For in proportion as the fall of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is an event which tends ruinously to the fall of his followers, so on the other hand it is a useful and helpful thing when a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, by the firmness of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, sets himself forth to his brethren as an object of imitation.</p>

<p>2. I have, moreover, read another epistle,  in which neither the person who wrote nor the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom it was written were plainly declared; and inasmuch as in the same letter both the writing and the matter, and even the paper itself, gave me the idea that something had been taken away, or had been changed from the original, I have sent you back the epistle as it actually came to hand, that you may examine whether it is the very same which you gave to Crementius the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacon</a>, to carry. For it is a very serious thing if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of a clerical letter is corrupted by any <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> or deceit. In order, then, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, ascertain whether the writing and subscription are yours, and write me again what is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the matter. I bid you, dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell.</p>
