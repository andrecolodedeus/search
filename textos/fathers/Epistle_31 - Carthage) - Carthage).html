<h1>Epistle 31</h1>

<p><strong>To the Carthaginian Clergy, About the Letters Sent to Rome, and Received Thence.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; The Carthaginian Clergy are Requested to Take Care that the Letters of the Roman Clergy and Cyprian's Answer are Communicated.</em></p>

<p>Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, his brethren, greeting. That you, my beloved brethren, might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what letters I have sent to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> acting  at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and what they have replied to me, and, moreover, what Moyses and Maximus, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and Rufinus and Nicostratus, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and the rest of the confessors that with them are kept in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, replied likewise to my letters, I have sent you copies to read. Do you take care, with as much diligence as you can, that what I have written, and what they have replied, be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to our brethren. And, moreover, if any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from foreign places,  my colleagues, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, should be present, or should arrive among you, let them hear all these matters from you; and if they wish to transcribe copies of the letters and to take them to their own people, let them have the opportunity of transcribing them; although I have, moreover, bidden Saturus the reader, our brother, to give liberty of copying them to any individuals who wish it; so that, in ordering, for the present, the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in any manner, an agreement, one and faithful, may be observed by all. But about the other matters which were to be dealt with, as I have also written to several of my colleagues, we will more fully consider them in a common council, when, by the Lord's permission, we shall begin to assemble into one place. I bid you, brethren, beloved and longed-for, ever heartily farewell. Salute the brotherhood. Farewell.</p>
