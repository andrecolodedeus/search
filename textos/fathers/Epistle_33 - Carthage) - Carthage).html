<h1>Epistle 33</h1>

<p><strong>To the Clergy and People, About the Ordination of Celerinus as Reader.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; This Letter is About the Same in Purport with the Preceding, Except that He Largely Commends the Constancy of Celerinus in His Confession of the Faith. Moreover, that Both of These Letters Were Written During His Retreat, is Sufficiently Indicated by the Circumstances of the Context.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and to the whole people, his brethren in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, greeting. The divine benefits, beloved brethren, should be acknowledged and embraced, wherewith the Lord has condescended to embellish and illustrate His Church in our times by granting a respite to His good confessors and His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, that they who had grandly confessed Christ should afterwards adorn Christ's <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ministries. Exult, therefore, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with me on receiving my letter, wherein I and my colleagues who were then present mention to you Celerinus, our brother, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> alike for his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and his character, as added to our <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, not by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> recommendation, but by divine condescension; who, when he hesitated to yield to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was constrained by her own admonition and exhortation, in a vision by night, not to refuse our persuasions; and she had more power, and constrained him, because it was not right, nor was it becoming, that he should be without <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, whom the Lord honoured with the dignity of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. </p>

<p>2. This man was the first in the struggle of our days; he was the leader among Christ's soldiers; he, in the midst of the burning beginnings of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, engaged with the very chief and author of the disturbance, in conquering with invincible firmness the adversary of his own conflict.  He made a way for others to conquer; a victor with no small amount of wounds, but triumphant by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, with the long-abiding and permanent penalties of a tedious conflict. For nineteen days, shut up in the close guard of a dungeon, he was racked and in irons; but although his body was laid in chains, his spirit remained free and at liberty. His flesh wasted away by the long endurance of hunger and thirst; but God fed his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that lived in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, with spiritual nourishments. He lay in punishments, the stronger for his punishments; imprisoned, greater than those that imprisoned him; lying prostrate, but loftier than those who stood; as bound, and firmer titan the links which bound him; judged, and more sublime than those who judged him; and although his feet were bound on the rack, yet the serpent was trodden on and ground down and vanquished. In his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> body shine the bright evidences of his wounds; their manifest traces show forth, and appear on the man's sinews and limbs, worn out with tedious wasting away.  Great things are they&mdash; marvellous things are they&mdash; which the brotherhood may hear of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and of his praises. And should any one appear like Thomas, who has little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in what he hears, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the eyes is not wanting, so that what one hears he may also see. In the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the wounds made the victory; the memory of the scars preserves that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<p>3. Nor is that kind of title to glories in the case of Celerinus, our beloved, an unfamiliar and novel thing. He is advancing in the footsteps of his kindred; he rivals his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and relations in equal honours of divine condescension. His grandmother, Celerina, was some time since crowned with <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Moreover, his paternal and maternal uncles, Laurentius and Egnatius, who themselves also were once warring in the camps of the world, but were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and spiritual soldiers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, casting down the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by the confession of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, merited palms and crowns from the Lord by their illustrious passion. We always offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for them,  as you remember, as often as we celebrate the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and days of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the annual commemoration. Nor could he, therefore, be degenerate and inferior whom this <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> dignity and a generous nobility provoked, by domestic examples of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But if in a worldly <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> it is a matter of heraldry and of praise to be a patrician, of bow much greater praise and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is it to become of noble rank in the celestial heraldry! I cannot tell whom I should call more blessed,&mdash; whether those ancestors, for a posterity so illustrious, or him, for an origin so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>. So equally between them does the divine condescension flow, and pass to and fro, that, just as the dignity of their offspring brightens their crown, so the sublimity of his ancestry illuminates his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<p>4. When this man, beloved brethren, came to us with such condescension of the Lord, illustrious by the testimony and wonder of the very man who had <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> him, what else behooved to be done except that he should be placed on the pulpit,  that is, on the tribunal of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; that, resting on the loftiness of a higher station, and conspicuous to the whole people for the brightness of his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, he should read the precepts and <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the Lord, which he so bravely and faithfully follows? Let the voice that has confessed the Lord daily be heard in those things which the Lord spoke. Let it be seen whether there is any further degree to which he can be advanced in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. There is nothing in which a confessor can do more good to the brethren than that, while the reading of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is heard from his lips, every one who hears should imitate the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the reader. He should have been associated with Aurelius in reading; with whom, moreover, he was associated in the alliance of divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; with whom, in all the insignia of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and praise, he had been united. Equal both, and each like to the other, in proportion as they were sublime in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in that proportion they were <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in modesty. As they were lifted up by divine condescension, so they were lowly in their own peacefulness and tranquillity, and equally affording examples to every one of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and character, and fitted both for conflict and for peace; praiseworthy in the former for strength, in the latter for modesty.</p>

<p>5. In such servants the Lord rejoices; in confessors of this kind He glories,&mdash; whose way and conversation is so advantageous to the announcement of their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that it affords to others a teaching of discipline. For this purpose Christ has willed them to remain long here in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for this purpose He has kept them safe, snatched from the midst of death&mdash;a kind of resurrection, so to speak, being wrought on their behalf; so that, while nothing is seen by the brethren loftier in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, nothing more lowly in humility, the way of life of the brotherhood  may accompany these same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Know, then, that these for the present are appointed readers, because it was fitting that the candle should be placed in a candlestick, whence it may give light to all, and that their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> countenance should be established in a higher place, where, beheld by all the surrounding brotherhood, they may give an incitement of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the beholders. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have already purposed the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a> for them, that so they may be honoured with the same presents as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and may share the monthly divisions  in equalled quantities, to sit with us hereafter in their advanced and strengthened years; although in nothing can he seem to be inferior in the qualities of age who has consummated his age by the dignity of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. I bid you, brethren, beloved and earnestly longed-for, ever heartily farewell.</p>
