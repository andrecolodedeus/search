<h1>Epistle 34</h1>

<p><strong>To the Same, About the Ordination of Numidicus as Presbyter.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian Tells the Clergy and People that Numidicus Has Been Ordained by Him Presbyter; And Briefly Commends His Worth.</em></p>

<p>Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and to the whole people, his brethren, very dear and longed-for, greeting. That which belongs, dearest brethren, both to the common <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and to the greatest <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of our Church ought to be told to you; for you must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have been admonished and instructed by divine condescension, that Numidicus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> should be appointed in the number of Carthaginian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and should sit with us among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>&mdash;a man illustrious by the brightest light of confession, exalted in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> both of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; who by his exhortation sent before himself an abundant number of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, slain by stones and by the flames, and who beheld with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> his wife abiding by his side, burned (I should rather say, preserved) together with the rest. He himself, half consumed, overwhelmed with stones, and left for dead&mdash;when afterwards his daughter, with the anxious consideration of affection, sought for the corpse of her father&mdash;was found half dead, was drawn out and revived, and remained unwillingly  from among the companions whom he himself had sent before. But the reason of his remaining behind, as we see, was this: that the Lord might add him to our <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and might adorn with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the number of our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> that had been desolated by the lapse of some.  And when God permits, he shall be advanced to a larger office in his region, when, by the Lord's protection, we have come into your presence once more. In the meantime, let what is revealed be done, that we receive this gift of God with thanksgiving, hoping from the Lord's mercy more ornaments of the same kind, that so the strength of His Church being renewed, He may make men so meek and lowly to flourish in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of our assembly. I bid you, brethren, very dear and longed-for, ever heartily farewell.</p>
