<h1>Epistle 39</h1>

<p><strong>To the People, Concerning Five Schismatic Presbyters of the Faction of Felicissimus.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; In Like Manner, as in the Epistle But One Before This, Cyprian Told the Clergy, So Now He Tells the People, that Felicissimus is to Be Avoided, Together with Five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> of His Faction, Who Not Only Granted Peace to the Lapsed Without Any Discrimination, But Stirred Up Sedition and Schism Against Himself.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to the whole people, greeting. Although, dearest brethren, Virtius,  a most faithful and upright <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and also Rogatianus and Numidicus, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, confessors, and illustrious by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the divine condescension, and also the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, good men and devoted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration in all its duties, with the other ministers, afford you the full attention of their presence, and do not cease to confirm individuals by their assiduous exhortations, and, moreover, to govern and reform the minds of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> by their wholesome counsels, yet, as much as I can, I admonish, and as I can, I visit you with my letters. By my letters I say, dearest brethren; for the malignity and treachery of certain of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> has accomplished this, that I should not be allowed to come to you before Easter-day; since mindful of their conspiracy, and retaining that ancient venom against my <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, that is, against your suffrage and God's judgment, they renew their old attack upon me, and once more begin their <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> machinations with their accustomed craft. And, indeed, of God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, neither by our wish nor desire, nay, although we were forgiving and silent, they have suffered the punishment which they had deserved; so that, not cast out by us, they of their own accord have cast themselves out. They themselves, before their own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, have passed sentence on themselves in accordance with your suffrages and the divine. These conspirators and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men of their own accord have driven themselves from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>2. Now it has appeared whence came the faction of Felicissimus; on what root and by what strength it stood. These men supplied in former times encouragements and exhortations to certain confessors, not to agree with their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, not to maintain the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and quietness according to the Lord's precepts, not to keep the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of their confession with an uncorrupt and unspotted conversation. And lest it should be too little to have corrupted the minds of certain confessors, and to have wished to arm a portion of our broken fraternity against God's <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, they have now turned their attention with their envenomed deceitfulness to the ruin of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, to turn away from the healing of their wound the sick and the wounded, and those who, by the misfortune of their fall, are less fit and less sturdy to take stronger counsel; and invite them, by the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of a fallacious peace, to a fatal rashness, leaving off <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications, whereby, with long and continual satisfaction, the Lord is to be appeased.</p>

<p>3. But I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, brethren, watch against the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and, taking care for your own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, be diligently on your guard against this death-bearing fallacy. This is another <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and another <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. Those five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> are none other than the five leaders who were lately associated with the magistrates in an edict, that they might overthrow our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that they might turn away the feeble hearts of the brethren to their deadly nets by the prevarication of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now the same scheme, the same overturning, is again brought about by the five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, linked with Felicissimus, to the destruction of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should not be besought, and that he who has denied Christ should not appeal for mercy to the same Christ whom he had denied; that after the fault of the crime, repentance also should be taken away; and that the Lord should not be appeased through <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but that the Lord's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> being. forsaken, a new tradition of a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> appointment should arise, contrary to the evangelical discipline. And although it was once arranged as well by us as by the confessors and the city  <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and moreover by all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appointed either in our province or beyond the sea,  that no novelty should be introduced in respect of the case of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> unless we all assembled into one place, and our counsels being compared, should decide upon a moderate sentence, tempered alike with discipline and with mercy&mdash;against this our counsel they have rebelled, and all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> authority and power is destroyed by factious conspiracies.</p>

<p>4. What sufferings do I now endure, dearest brethren, that I myself am not able to come to you at the present juncture, that I myself cannot approach you each one, that I myself cannot exhort you according to the teaching of the Lord and of His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>! An exile of, now, two years  was not sufficient, and a mournful separation from you, from your countenance, and from your sight&mdash;continual grief and lamentation, which, in my loneliness without you, breaks me to pieces with my constant mourning, nor my tears flowing day and night, that there is not even an opportunity for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, whom you made with so much <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and eagerness, to greet you, nor to be enfolded in your embraces. This greater grief is added to my worn spirit, that in the midst of so much solicitude and necessity I am not able myself to hasten to you, since, by the threats and by the snares of perfidious men, we are anxious that on our coming a greater tumult may not arise there; and so, although the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ought to be careful for peace and tranquillity in all things, he himself should seem to have afforded material for sedition, and to have embittered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> anew. Hence, however, beloved brethren, I not only admonish but counsel you, not rashly to trust to mischievous words, nor to yield an easy consent to deceitful sayings, nor to take darkness for light, night for day, hunger for food, thirst for drink, poison for medicine, death for safety. Let not the age nor the authority deceive you of those who, answering to the ancient <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the two elders;  as they attempted to corrupt and violate the chaste Susannah,  are thus also attempting, with their adulterous doctrines, to corrupt the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and violate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>5. The Lord cries aloud, saying, <q>Hearken not unto the words of the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, for the visions of their own hearts deceive them. They speak, but not out of the mouth of the Lord. They say to them that despise the word of the Lord, You shall have peace.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052349"><a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse16">Jeremiah&nbsp;23:16-17</a></span> They are now offering peace who have not peace themselves. They are promising to bring back and recall the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who themselves have departed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, and Christ is one, and there is one Church, and one chair founded upon the rock by the word of the Lord.  Another altar cannot be constituted nor a new <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> be made, except the one altar and the one <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Whosoever gathers elsewhere, scatters. Whatsoever is appointed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, so that the divine disposition is violated, is adulterous, is impious, is <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>. Depart far from the contagion of men of this kind. and flee from their words, avoiding them as a cancer and a plague, as the Lord warns you and says, <q>They are blind leaders of the blind. But if the blind lead the blind, they shall both fall into the ditch.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052351"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse14">Matthew 15:14</a></span> They intercept your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, which you pour forth with us to God day and night, to appease Him with a righteous satisfaction. They intercept your tears with which you wash away the guilt of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> you have committed; they intercept the peace which you <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and faithfully ask from the mercy of the Lord; and they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is written, <q>And that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, or that dreamer of dreams, that has spoken to turn you away from the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052352"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 13:5</a></span> Let no one, beloved brethren, make you to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> from the ways of the Lord; let no one snatch you, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Christ; let no one take sons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> away from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; let them perish alone for themselves who have wished to perish; let them remain outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone who have departed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; let them anoia be without <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have rebelled against <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; let them alone undergo the penalties of their conspiracies who formerly, according to your votes, and now according to God's judgment, have deserved to undergo the sentence of their own conspiracy and malignity.</p>

<p>6. The Lord warns us in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, saying, <q>You reject the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may establish your own tradition.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052353"><a href="../bible/mar007.htm#verse9">Mark 7:9</a></span> Let them who reject the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and endeavour to keep their own tradition be bravely and firmly rejected by you; let one downfall be sufficient for the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>; let no one by his fraud hurl down those who wish to rise; let no one cast down more deeply and depress those who are down, on whose behalf we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that they may be raised up by God's hand and arm; let no one turn away from all hope of safety those who are half alive and entreating that they may receive their former health; let no one extinguish every light of the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to those that are wavering in the darkness of their lapse. The apostle instructs us, saying, <q>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to the wholesome words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> and His doctrine, he is lifted up with foolishness: from such withdraw yourself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052354"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse3">1 Timothy 6:3-5</a></span> And again he says, <q>Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things comes the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God upon the children of disobedience. Be not therefore partakers with them.</q>  There is no reason that you should be deceived with vain words, and begin to be partakers of their depravity. Depart from such, I entreat you, and acquiesce in our counsels, who daily pour out for you continual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to the Lord, who desire that you should be recalled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the clemency of the Lord, who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the fullest peace from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, first for the mother, and then for her children. Join also your petitions and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> with our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and petitions; mingle your tears with our wailings. Avoid the wolves who separate the sheep from the shepherd; avoid the envenomed tongue of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who from the beginning of the world, always deceitful and lying, lies that he may deceive, cajoles that he may injure, promises good that he may give <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, promises life that he may <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. Now also his words are evident, and his poisons are plain. He promises peace, in order that peace may not possibly be attained; he promises <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that he who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> may not come to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; he promises a Church, when he so contrives that he who believes him may utterly perish apart from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>7. It is now the occasion, dearly beloved brethren, both for you who stand fast to persevere bravely, and to maintain your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> stability, which you kept in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> with a continual firmness; and if any of you by the circumvention of the adversary have fallen, that in this second <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> you should faithfully take counsel for your hope and your peace; and in order that the Lord may pardon you, that you should not depart from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Lord, since it is written, <q>And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or unto the judge that shall be in those days, even that man shall die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052356"><a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy 17:12</a></span> Of this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> this is the latest and final <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, which itself also, by the Lord's protection, shall quickly pass away; so that I shall be again presented to you after Easter-day with my colleagues, who, being present, we shall be able as well to arrange as to complete the matters which require to be done according to your judgment and to the general advice of all of us as it has been decided before.  But if anybody, refusing to repent and to make satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall yield to the party of Felicissimus and his satellites, and shall join himself to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> faction, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he cannot afterwards return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and communicate with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the people of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I bid you, dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell, and that you plead with me in continual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that the mercy of God may be entreated.</p>
