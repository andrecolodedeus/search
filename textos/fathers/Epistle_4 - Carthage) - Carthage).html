<h1>Epistle 4</h1>

<p><strong>To the Presbyters and Deacons.</strong> </p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian Exhorts His Clergy from His Place of Retirement, that in His Absence They Should Be United; That Nothing Should Be Wanting to Prisoners or to the Rest of the Poor; And Further, that They Should Keep the People in Quiet, Lest, If They Should Rush in Crowds to Visit the Martyrs in Prison, This Privilege Should at Length Be Forbidden Them. A.D. 250.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, his beloved brethren, greeting. Being by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in safety, dearest brethren, I salute you, rejoicing that I am informed of the prosperity of all things in respect of your safety also; and as the condition of the place  does not permit me to be with you now, I beg you, by your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and your religion, to discharge there both your own office and mine, that there may be nothing wanting either to discipline or diligence. In respect of means, moreover, for meeting the expenses, whether for those who, having confessed their Lord with a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> voice, have been put in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, or for those who are labouring in poverty and want, and still stand fast in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, I entreat that nothing be wanting, since the whole of the small sum which was collected there was distributed among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for cases of that kind, that many might have means whence they could assist the necessities and burthens of individuals.</p>

<p>2. I beg also that there may be no lack, on your parts, of wisdom and carefulness to preserve peace. For although from their affection the brethren are eager to approach and to visit those good confessors, on whom by their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> beginnings the divine consideration has already shed a brightness, yet I think that this eagerness must be cautiously indulged, and not in crowds&mdash;not in numbers collected together at once', lest from this very thing ill-will be aroused, and the means of access be denied, and thus, while we insatiably wish for all, we lose all. Take counsel, therefore, and see that this may be more safely managed with moderation, so that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> also, who there offer  with the confessors, may one by one take turns with the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> individually; because, by thus changing the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and varying the people that come together, suspicion is diminished. For, meek and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in all things, as befits the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we ought to accommodate ourselves to the times, and to provide for quietness, and to have regard to the people. I bid you, brethren, beloved and dearly longed-for, always heartily farewell; and have me in remembrance. Greet all the brotherhood. Victor the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and those who are with me, greet you.Farewell!</p>
