<h1>Epistle 40</h1>

<p><strong>To Cornelius, on His Refusal to Receive Novatian's Ordination.</strong> </p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; The Messengers Sent by <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> to Intimate His Ordination to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> are Rejected by Cyprian.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Cornelius, his brother, greeting. There have come to us, beloved brother, sent by <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, Maximus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and Augendus the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and a certain Machaeus and Longinus. But, as we discovered, as well from the letters which they brought with them, as from their discourse and declaration, that <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> had been made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; disturbed by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of an unlawful ordination made in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we considered at once that they must be restrained from communion with us; and having, in the meanwhile, refuted and repelled the things which they pertinaciously and obstinately endeavoured to assert, I and several of my colleagues, who had come together to me, were awaiting the arrival of our colleagues Caldonius and Fortunatus, whom we had lately sent to you as ambassadors, and to our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who were present at your ordination,  in order that, when they came and reported the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the matter, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the adverse party might be quelled through them, by greater authority and manifest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. But there came, in addition, Pompeius and Stephanus, our colleagues, who themselves also, by way of instructing us thereon, put forward manifest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> and testimonies in conformity with their gravity and faithfulness, so that it was not even necessary that those who had come, as sent by <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, should be heard any further. And when in our solemn assembly  they burst in with invidious abuse and turbulent clamour, demanding that the accusations, which they said that they brought and would prove, should be publicly investigated by us and by the people, we said that it was not consistent with our gravity to suffer the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of our colleague, who had already been chosen and ordained and approved by the laudable sentence of many, to be called into question any further by the abusive voice of rivals. And because it would be a long business to collect into a letter the matters in which they have been refuted and repressed, and in which they have been manifested as having caused <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by their unlawful attempts, you shall hear everything most fully from Primitivus our co-presbyter,  when he shall come to you.</p>

<p>2. And lest their raging boldness should ever cease, they are striving here also to distract the members of Christ into schismatical parties, and to cut and tear the one body of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that, running about from door to door, through the houses of many, or from city to city, through certain districts, they seek for companions in their obstinacy and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to join to themselves in their <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. To whom we have once given this reply, nor shall we cease to command them to lay aside their pernicious dissensions and disputes, and to be aware that it is an impiety to forsake their Mother; and to acknowledge and understand that when a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>  is once made and approved by the testimony and judgment of his colleagues and the people, another can by no means be appointed.  Thus, if they consult their own interest peaceably and faithfully, if they confess themselves to be maintainers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they must return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>
