<h1>Epistle 41</h1>

<p><strong>To Cornelius, About Cyprian's Approval of His Ordination, and Concerning Felicissimus.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian Excuses Himself for Not Having Without Hesitation Believed in the Ordination of Cornelius, Until He Received the Letters of His Colleagues Caldonius And Fortunatus, Which Fully Testified to Its Legitimacy; And Incidentally Repeats, in Respect of the Contrary Faction of the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> Party, that He Did Not in the Very First Instance Give His Adhesion to That, But Rather to Cornelius, Even to the Extent of Refusing to Receive Accusations Against Him.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Cornelius his brother, greeting. As was fitting for God's servants, and especially for upright and peaceable <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, dearest brother, we recently sent our colleagues Caldonius and Fortunatus, that they might, not only by the persuasion of our letters, but by their presence and the advice of all of you, strive and labour with all their power to bring the members of the divided body into the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and associate them into the bond of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity. But since the obstinate and inflexible pertinacity of the adverse party has not only rejected the bosom and the embrace of its root and Mother, but even, with a discord spreading and reviving itself worse and worse, has appointed a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for itself, and, contrary to the sacrament once delivered of the divine appointment and of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Unity, has made an adulterous and opposed head outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; having received your letters as well as those of our colleagues, at the coining also of our colleagues Pompeius and Stephanus, good men and very dear to us, by whom all these things were undoubtedly alleged and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to us with general <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>,  in conformity with the requirements alike of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divine tradition and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution, we have directed our letters to you. Moreover, bringing these same things trader the notice of our several colleagues throughout the province, we have bidden also that our brethren, with letters from them, be directed to you.</p>

<p>2. <em>This has been done</em>, although our mind and intention had been already plainly declared to the brethren, and to the whole of the people in this place, when, having received letters lately from both parties, we read your letters, and intimated your ordination to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, in the ears of every one. Moreover, remembering the common <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and having respect for the sacerdotal gravity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, we repudiated those things which from the other party had been heaped together with bitter virulence into a document transmitted to us; alike considering and weighing, that in so great and so religious an assembly of brethren, in which God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were sitting together, and His altar was set, they ought neither to be read nor to be heard. For those things should not easily be put forward, nor carelessly and rudely published, which may move a scandal by means of a quarrelsome pen in the minds of the hearers, and confuse brethren, who are placed far apart and dwelling across the sea, with uncertain opinions. Let those beware, who, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> either their own rage or <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and unmindful of the divine law and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to throw abroad in the meantime things which they cannot prove; and although they may not be successful in destroying and ruining innocence, are satisfied with scattering stains upon it with lying reports and false rumours. Assuredly, we should exert ourselves, as it is fitting for prelates and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to do, that such things, when they are written by any, should be repudiated as far as we are concerned. For otherwise, what will become of that which we learn and which we declare to be laid down in Scripture: <q>Keep your tongue from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and your lips from speaking guile? </q>  And elsewhere: <q>Your mouth abounded in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and your tongue embraced deceit. You sat and spoke against your brother, and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> your own mother's son.</q>  Also whist the apostle says: <q>Let no corrupt communication proceed from your mouth, but that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the edifying of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that it may minister <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unto the hearers.</q>  Further, we show what the right course of conduct to pursue is,  if, when such things are written by the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> temerity of some, we do not allow them to be read among us: and therefore, dearest brother, when such letters came to me against you, even though they were the letters of your co-presbyter sitting with you,  as they breathed a tone of religious simplicity, and did not echo with any barkings of curses and revilings, I ordered them to be read to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the people.</p>

<p>3. But in desiring letters from our colleagues,  who were present at your ordination at that place, we did not forget the ancient usage, nor did we seek for any novelty. For it was sufficient for you to announce yourself by letters  to have been made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, unless there had been a dissenting faction on the other side, who by their <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> fabrications disturbed the minds and perplexed the hearts of our colleagues, as well as of several of the brethren. To set this matter at rest, we judged it necessary to obtain thence the strong and decided authority of our colleagues who wrote to us; and they, declaring the testimony of their letters to be fully deserved by your character, and life, and teaching, have deprived even your rivals, and those who delight either in novelty or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, of every scruple of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or of difference; and, according to our advice weighed in wholesome reason, the minds of the brethren tossing about in this sea have sincerely and decidedly approved your <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. For this, my brother, we especially both labour after, and ought to labour after, to be careful to maintain as much as we can the unity delivered by the Lord, and through His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to us their successors, and, as far as in us lies, to gather into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the dispersed and wandering sheep which the wilful faction and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of some is separating from their Mother; those only being left outside, who by their obstinacy and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> have persisted, and have been unwilling to return to us; who themselves will have to give an account to the Lord of the dissension and separation made by them, and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that they have forsaken.</p>

<p>4. Bill, so far as pertains to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> here, and of Felicissimus, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what has been done here, our colleagues have sent you letters subscribed by their own hand, that you may learn, when you have heard the parties, from their letters what they have thought and what they have pronounced. But you will do better,  brother, if you will also bid copies of the letters which I had sent lately by our colleagues Caldonius and Fortunatus to you, to he read for the common satisfaction, which I had written concerning the same Felicissimus and his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there, and also to the people, to be read to the brethren there; declaring your ordination, and the course of the whole transaction, that so as well there as here the brotherhood may be informed of all things by us. Moreover, I have here transmitted also copies of the same by Mettius the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacon</a>, sent by me, and by Nicephorus the acolyte. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>
