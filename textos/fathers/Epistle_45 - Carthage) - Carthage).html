<h1>Epistle 45</h1>

<p><strong>Cornelius to Cyprian, on the Return of the Confessors to Unity.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cornelius Informs Cyprian of the Solemn Return of the Confessors to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and Describes It.</em></p>

<p>1. Cornelius to Cyprian his brother, greeting. In proportion to the solicitude and anxiety that we sustained in respect of those confessors who had been circumvented and almost deceived and alienated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the craft and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of that wily and subtle man,  was the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> with which we were affected, and the thanks which we gave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> and to our Lord Christ, when they, acknowledging their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and perceiving the poisoned cunning of the malignant man, as if of a serpent, came back, as they with one heart profess, with singleness of will to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from which they had gone forth. And first, indeed, our brethren of approved <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, loving peace and desiring unity, announced that the swelling <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of these men was already soothed;  yet there was no fitting assurance to induce us easily to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they were thoroughly changed. But afterwards, Urbanus and Sidonius the confessors came to our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, affirming that Maximus the confessor and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, equally with themselves, desired to return into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but since many things had preceded this which they had contrived, of which you also have been made aware from our co-bishops and from my letters, so that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> could not hastily be reposed in them, we determined to hear from their own mouth and confession those things which they had sent by the messengers. And when they came, and were required by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> to give an account of what they had done, and were charged with having very lately repeatedly sent letters full of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> and reproaches, in their name, through all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and had disturbed nearly all the churches; they affirmed that they had been deceived, and that they had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what was in those letters; that only through being misled they had also committed schismatical acts, and been the authors of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, so that they suffered hands to be imposed on him as if upon a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.  And when these and other matters had been charged upon them, they entreated that they might be done away and altogether discharged from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>.</p>

<p>2. The whole of this transaction therefore being brought before me, I decided that the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>  should be brought together; (for there were present five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who were also present today;) so that by well-grounded counsel it might be determined with the consent of all what ought to be observed in respect of their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. And that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the feeling of all, and the advice of each one, I decided also to bring to your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> our various opinions, which you will read subjoined. When these things were done, Maximus, Urbanus, Sidonius, and several brethren who had joined themselves to them, came to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>, desiring with earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that what had been done before might fall into oblivion, and no mention might be made of it; and <em>promising</em> that henceforth, as though nothing had been either done or said, all things on both sides being forgiven, they would now exhibit to God a heart clean and pure, following the evangelical word which says, <q>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052386"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> What remained was, that the people should be informed of all this proceeding, that they might see those very men established in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whom they had long seen and mourned as wanderers and scattered. Their will being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, a great concourse of the brotherhood was assembled. There was one voice from all, giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; all were expressing the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of their heart by tears, embracing them as if they had this day been set free from the penalty of the dungeon. And to quote their very own words&mdash;<q>We,</q> they say, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Cornelius is <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> elected by Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by Christ our Lord. We confess our <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; we have suffered imposture; we were deceived by captious perfidy and loquacity. For although we seemed, as it were, to have held a kind of communion with a man who was a schismatic and a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, yet our mind was always sincere in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For we are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>; that there is one Christ the Lord whom we have confessed, and one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and that in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there ought to be one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</q>  Were we not rightly induced by that confession of theirs,  to allow that what they had confessed before the power of the world they might approve when established in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Wherefore we bade Maximus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> to take his own place; the rest we received with great approbation of the people. But we remitted all things to Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whose power all things are reserved.</p>

<p>3. These things therefore, brother, written to you in the same hour, at the same moment, we have transmitted; and I have sent away at once Nicephorus the acolyte, hastening to descend to embarkation, that so, no delay being made, you might, as if you had been present among that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and in that assembly of people, give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> and to Christ our Lord. But we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>&mdash; nay, we confide in it for certain-that the others also who have been ranged in this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> will shortly return into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> when they see their leaders acting with us. I think. brother, that you ought to send these letters also to the other churches, that all may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the craft and prevarication of this schismatic and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> are from day to day being reduced to nothing. Farewell, dearest brother.</p>
