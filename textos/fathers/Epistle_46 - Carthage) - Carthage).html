<h1>Epistle 46</h1>

<p><strong>Cyprian's Answer to Cornelius, Congratulating Him on the Return of the Confessors from Schism.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; He Congratulates Him on the Return of the Confessors to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and Reminds Him How Much that Return Benefits the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Cornelius his brother, greeting. I profess that I both have rendered and do render the greatest thanks without ceasing, dearest brother, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty, and to His Christ the Lord and our God and Saviour, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is thus divinely protected, and its unity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is not constantly nor altogether corrupted by the obstinacy of perfidy and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. For we have read your letter, and have exultingly received the greatest <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> from <em>the fulfilment of</em> our common desire; to wit, that Maximus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and Urbanus, the confessors, with Sidonius and Macarius, have re-entered into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that is, that they have laid aside their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and given up their schismatical, nay, their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and have sought again in the soundness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the home of unity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; that whence they had gone forth to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, there they might <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> return; and that they who had confessed Christ should not afterwards desert the camp of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that they might not tempt the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of their charity and unity,  who had not been overcome in strength and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. Behold the safe and unspotted integrity of their praise; behold the uncorrupted and substantial dignity of these confessors, that they have departed from the deserters and fugitives, that they have left the betrayers of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the impugners of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. With reason did both the people and the brotherhood receive them when they returned, as you write, with the greatest <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; since in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of confessors who had maintained their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and returned to unity, there is none who does not reckon himself a partner and a sharer.</p>

<p>2. We can estimate the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of that day  from our own feelings. For if, in this place, the whole number of the brethren rejoiced at your letter which you sent concerning their confession, and received this tidings of common rejoicing with the greatest alacrity, what must have been the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> there when the matter itself, and the general <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, was carried on tinder the eyes of all? For since the Lord in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says that there is the highest <q><a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in heaven over one sinner that <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a>,</q>  how much greater is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in earth, no less than in heaven, over confessors who return with their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and with praise to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, and make a way of returning for others by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and approval of their example? For this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> had led away certain of our brethren, so that they thought they were following the communion of confessors. When this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was removed, light was infused into the breasts of all, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been shown to be one, and to be able neither to be cut nor divided. Nor can any one now be easily deceived by the talkative words of a raging schismatic, since it has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that good and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> soldiers of Christ could not long be detained without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the deceitfulness and perfidy of others. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>
