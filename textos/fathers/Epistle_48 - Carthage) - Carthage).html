<h1>Epistle 48</h1>

<p><strong>Cyprian's Answer to Cornelius, Concerning the Crimes of Novatus.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; He Praises Cornelius, that He Had Given Him Timely Warning, Seeing that the Day After the Guilty Faction Had Come to Him He Had Received Cornelius' Letter. Then He Describes at Length Novatus' Crimes, and the Schism that Had Before Been Stirred Up by Him in Africa.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Cornelius his brother, greeting. You have acted, dearest brother, both with diligence and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in sending us in haste Nicephorus the acolyte, who both told us the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> concerning the return of the confessors, and most fully instructed us against the new and mischievous devices of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> and Novatus for attacking the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For whereas on the day before, that mischievous faction of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> had arrived here, itself already lost and ready to ruin others who should join it, on the day after, Nicephorus arrived with your letter. From which we both learned ourselves, and have begun to teach and to instruct others, that Evaristus from being a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has now not remained even a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>; but, banished from the see and from the people, and an exile from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he roves about far and wide through other provinces, and, himself having made shipwreck of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is preparing for some who are like him, as fearful shipwrecks. Moreover, that Nicostratus, having lost the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> of sacred administrations, because he had abstracted the Church's money by a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> fraud, and disowned the deposits of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, did not wish so much to come into Africa as to escape there from the city, from the consciousness of his rapines and his frightful crimes. And now a deserter and a fugitive from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as if to have changed the clime were to change the man, he goes on to boast and announce himself a confessor, although <em>he</em> can no longer either be or be called a confessor of Christ who has denied Christ's Church. For when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>; but I speak concerning Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052396"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse31">Ephesians&nbsp;5:31-32</a></span> &mdash; when, I say, the blessed apostle says this, and with his sacred voice testifies to the unity of Christ with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, cleaving to one another with indivisible links, how can he be with Christ who is not with the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and in His Church?  Or how does he assume to himself the charge of ruling or governing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who has spoiled and wronged the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>?</p>

<p>2. For about Novatus there need have been nothing told by you to us, since Novatus ought rather to have been shown by us to you, as always greedy of novelty, raging with the rapacity of an insatiable <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, inflated with the arrogance and stupidity of swelling <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; always <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> with bad repute to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> there; always condemned by the voice of all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and a perfidious man; always inquisitive, that he may betray: he flatters for the purpose of deceiving, never faithful that he may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; a torch and fire to blow up the flames of sedition; a whirlwind and tempest to make shipwrecks of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; the foe of quiet, the adversary of tranquillity, the enemy of peace. Finally, when Novatus withdrew thence from among you, that is, when the storm and the whirlwind departed, calm arose there in part, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and good confessors who by his instigation had departed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, after he retired from the city, returned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This is the same Novatus who first sowed among us the flames of discord and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; who separated some of the brethren here from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; who, in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> itself, was to our people, as it were, another <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, to overthrow the minds of the brethren. He it is who, without my leave or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, of his own factiousness and ambition appointed his attendant Felicissimus a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and with his own tempest sailing also to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to overthrow the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, endeavoured to do similar and equal things there, forcibly separating a part of the people from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and dividing the concord of the fraternity that was firmly knit together and mutually loving one another. Since Rome from her greatness plainly ought to take precedence of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, he there committed still greater and graver crimes.  He who in the one place had made a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the other made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Nor let any one be surprised at this in such men. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are always madly carried away by their own <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; and after they have committed crimes, they are agitated by the very consciousness of a depraved mind. Neither can those remain in God's Church, who have not maintained its divine and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline, either in the conversation of their life or the peace of their character. Orphans despoiled by him, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> defrauded, moneys moreover of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> withheld, exact from him those penalties which we behold inflicted in his <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. His father also died of hunger in the street, and afterwards even in death was not buried by him. The womb of his wife was smitten by a blow of his heel; and in the miscarriage that soon followed, the offspring was brought forth, the fruit of a father's <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. And now does he dare to condemn the hands of those who <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, when he himself is more guilty in his feet, by which the son, who was about to be born, was slain?</p>

<p>3. He long ago feared this consciousness of crime. On account of this he regarded it as certain that he would not only be turned out of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>, but restrained from communion; and by the urgency of the brethren, the day of investigation was coming on, on which his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> was to be dealt with before us, if the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> had net prevented. He, welcoming this, with a sort of desire of escaping and evading condemnation, committed all these crimes, and wrought all this stir; so that he who was to be ejected and excluded from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, anticipated the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> departure, as if to have anticipated the sentence were to have escaped the punishment.</p>

<p>4. But in respect to the other brethren, over whom we grieve that they were circumvented by him, we labour that they may avoid the mischievous neighbourhood of the crafty <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a>, that they may escape the deadly nets of his solicitations, that they may once more seek the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from which he deserved by divine authority to be expelled. Such indeed, with the Lord's help, we trust may return by His mercy, for one cannot perish unless it is plain that he must perish, since the Lord in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says, <q>Every planting which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052399"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;15:13</a></span> He alone who has not been planted in the precepts and warnings of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, can depart from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: he alone can forsake the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>  and abide in his <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> with schismatics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the indulgence of Christ our Lord, and our own patience, will unite the rest with us. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>
