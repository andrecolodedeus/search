<h1>Epistle 50</h1>

<p><strong>From Cyprian to the Confessors, Congratulating Them on Their Return from Schism.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian Congratulates the Roman Confessors on Their Return into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and Replies to Their Letters.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Maximus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, also to Urbanus, and Sidonius, and Maturest, his brethren, greeting. When I read your letters, dearest brethren, that you wrote to me about your return, and about the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the brotherly restoration, I confess that I was as greatly overjoyed as I had before been overjoyed when I learned the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of your confession, and thankfully received tidings of the heavenly and spiritual renown of your warfare. For this, moreover, is another confession of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and praise; to confess that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is one, and not to become a sharer in other men's <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, or rather <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; to seek anew the same camp whence you went forth, whence with the most vigorous strength you leapt forth to wage the battle and to subdue the adversary. For the trophies from the battlefield ought to be brought back there whence the arms for the field had been received, lest the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should not retain those same <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> warriors whom Christ had furnished for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Now, however, you have kept in the peace of the Lord the fitting tenor of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the law of undivided charity and concord, and have given by your walk an example of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and peace to others; so that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the unity of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which is held by us, are also linked together by your consent and bond; and confessors of Christ do not become the leaders of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, after having stood forth as praiseworthy originators of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<p>2. Let others consider how much they may congratulate you, or how much each one may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for himself: I confess that I congratulate you more, and I more boast of you to others, in respect of this your peaceful return and charity. For you ought in simplicity to hear what was in my heart. I grieved vehemently, and I was greatly afflicted, that I could not hold communion with those whom once I had begun to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. After the schismatical and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> laid hold of you, on your going forth from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, it seemed as if your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> had been left in the dungeon. For there the dignity of your name seemed to have stayed behind when the soldiers of Christ did not return from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, although they had gone into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> with the praise and congratulations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>3. For although there seem to be tares in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, yet neither our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor our charity ought to be hindered, so that because we see that there are tares in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> we ourselves should withdraw from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: we ought only to labour that we may be wheat, that when the wheat shall begin to be gathered into the Lord's barns, we may receive fruit for our labour and work. The apostle in his epistle says, <q>In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and some to dishonour.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052404"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:20</a></span> Let us strive, dearest brethren, and labour as much as we possibly can, that we may be vessels of gold or silver. But to the Lord alone it is granted to break the vessels of earth, to whom also is given the rod of iron. The servant cannot be greater than his lord, nor may any one claim to himself what the Father has given to the Son alone, so as to think that he can take the fan for winnowing and purging the threshing-floor, or can separate by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment all the tares from the wheat. That is a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> obstinacy and a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> presumption which a depraved <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> assumes to itself. And while some are always assuming to themselves more dominion than meek <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> demands, they perish from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and while they insolently extol themselves, blinded by their own swelling, they lose the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For which reason we also, keeping moderation, and considering the Lord's balances, and thinking of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, have long and carefully pondered with ourselves, and have weighed what was to be done with due moderation.</p>

<p>4. All which matters you can look into thoroughly, if you will read the tracts  which I have lately read here, and have, for the sake of our mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, transmitted to you also for you to read; wherein there is neither wanting for the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, censure which may rebuke, nor medicine which may heal. Moreover, my feeble ability has expressed as well as it could the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  Which treatise I now more and more trust will be pleasing to you, since you now read it in such a way as both to approve and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it; inasmuch as what we have written in words you fulfil in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, when you return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the unity of charity and peace. I bid you, dearest brethren, and greatly longed-for, ever heartily farewell.</p>
