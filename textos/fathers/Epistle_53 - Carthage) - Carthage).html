<h1>Epistle 53</h1>

<p><strong>To Cornelius, Concerning Granting Peace to the Lapsed.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian Announces This Decree of the Bishops in the Name of the Whole Synod to Father Cornelius; And Therefore This Letter is Not So Much the Letter of Cyprian Himself, as that of the Entire African Synod.</em> </p>

<p>Cyprian, Liberalis, Caldonius, Nicomedes, Caecilius, Junius, Marrutius, Felix, Successus, Faustinus, Fortunatus, Victor, Saturninus, another Saturninus, Rogatianus, Tertullus, Lucianus, Eutyches, Amplus, Sattius, Secundinus, another Saturninus, Aurelius, Priscus, Herculanus, Victoricus, Quintus, Honoratus, <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, Hortensianus, Verianus, Iambus, Donatus, Pompeius, Polycarpus, Demetrius, another Donatus, Privatianus, another Fortunatus, Rogatus and Monulus, to Cornelius their brother,  greeting. </p>

<p>1. We had indeed decided some time ago, dearest brother, having mutually taken counsel one with another, that they who, in the fierceness of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, had been overthrown by the adversary, and had lapsed, and had polluted themselves with unlawful <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, should undergo a long and full repentance; and if the risk of sickness should be urgent, should receive peace on the very point of death. For it was not right, neither did the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father nor divine mercy allow, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be closed to those that knock, or the help of the hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> be denied to those who mourn and entreat, so that when they pass from this world, they should be dismissed to their Lord without communion and peace; since He Himself who gave the law, that things which were bound on earth should also be bound in heaven, allowed, moreover, that things might be loosed there which were here first loosed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But now, when we see that the day of another trouble is again beginning to draw near, and are admonished by frequent and repeated intimations that we should be prepared and armed for the struggle which the enemy announces to us, that we should also prepare the people committed to us by divine condescension, by our exhortations, and gather together from all parts all the soldiers of Christ who desire arms, and are anxious for the battle within the Lord's camp: trader the compulsion of this necessity, <em>we have decided</em> that peace is to be given to those who have not withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord, but have not ceased from the first day of their lapse to repent, and to lament, and to beseech the Lord; and we have decided that they ought to be armed and equipped for the battle which is at hand.</p>

<p>2. For we must comply with fitting intimations and admonitions, that the sheep may not be deserted in danger by the shepherds, but that the whole flock may be gathered together into one place, and the Lord's army may be arrived for the contest of the heavenly warfare. For the repentance of the mourners was reasonably prolonged for a more protracted time, help only being afforded to the sick in their departure, so long as peace and tranquillity prevailed, which permitted the long postponement of the tears of the mourners, and late assistance in sickness to the dying. But now indeed peace is necessary, not for the sick, but for the strong; nor is communion to he granted by us to the dying, but to the living, that we may not leave those whom we stir up and exhort to the battle unarmed and naked, but may fortify them with the protection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and blood. And, as the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> is appointed for this very purpose that it may be a safeguard to the receivers, <em>it is needful</em> that we may arm those whom we wish to be safe against the adversary with the protection of the Lord's abundance. For how do we teach or provoke them to shed their blood in confession of His name. if we deny to those who are about to enter on the warfare the blood of Christ? Or how do we make them fit for the cup of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, if we do not first admit them to drink, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the cup of the Lord  by the right of communion?</p>

<p>3. We should make a difference, dearest brother, between those who either have <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a>, and, having returned to the world which they have renounced, are living heathenish lives, or, having become deserters to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, are daily taking up parricidal arms against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and those who do not depart from the Church's threshold, and, constantly and sorrowfully imploring divine and paternal consolation, profess that they are now prepared for the battle, and ready to stand and fight bravely for the name of their Lord and for their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. In these times we grant peace, not to those who sleep, but to those who watch. We grant peace, not amid indulgences, but amid arms. We grant peace, not for rest, but for the field of battle. If, according to what we hear, and desire, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> of them, they shall stand bravely, and shall overthrow the adversary with us in the encounter, we shall not repent of having granted peace to men so brave. Yea, it is the great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of our <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> to have granted peace to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, so that we, as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who daily celebrate the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may prepare offerings and victims for God. But if&mdash; which may the Lord avert from our brethren&mdash; any one of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> should deceive, seeking peace by guile, and at the time of the impending struggle receiving peace without any purpose of doing battle, he betrays and deceives himself, hiding one thing in his heart and pronouncing another with his voice. We, so far as it is allowed to us to see and to judge, look upon the face of each one; we are not able to scrutinize the heart and to inspect the mind. Concerning these the Discerner and Searcher of hidden things judges, and He will quickly come and judge of the secrets and hidden things of the heart. But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ought not to stand in the way of the good, but rather the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ought to be assisted by the good. Neither is peace, therefore, to be denied to those who are about to endure <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, because there are some who will refuse it, since for this purpose peace should be granted to all who are about to enter upon the warfare, that through our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> he may not be the first one to be passed over, who in the struggle is to be crowned.</p>

<p>4. Nor let any one say, <q>that he who accepts <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in his own blood, and peace is not necessary to him from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, since he is about to have the peace of his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and about to receive a greater reward from the condescension of the Lord.</q> First of all, he cannot be fitted for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> who is not armed for the contest by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and his spirit is deficient which the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> received does not raise and stimulate. For the Lord says in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>But when they deliver you up, take no thought what you shall speak; for it shall be given you in that hour what you shall speak. For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052476"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;10:19-20</a></span> Now, since He says that the Spirit of the Father speaks in those who are delivered up and set in the confession of His name, how can he be found prepared or fit for that confession who has not first, in the reception of peace, received the Spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who, giving strength to His servants, Himself speaks and confesses in us? Then, besides&mdash; if, having forsaken everything that he has, a man shall flee, and dwelling in hiding-places and in solitude, shall fall by chance among thieves, or shall die in fever and in weakness, will it not be charged upon us that so good a soldier, who has forsaken all that he has, and contemning his house, and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and his children, has preferred to follow his Lord, dies without peace and without communion? Will not either inactive negligence or cruel hardness be ascribed to us in the day of judgment, that, pastors though we are, we have neither been willing to take care of the sheep trusted and committed to us in peace, nor to arm them in battle? Would not the charge be brought against us by the Lord, which by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> He utters and says? <q>Behold, you consume the milk, and you clothe you with the wool, and you kill them that are fed; but feed not my flock. You have not strengthened the weak; neither have you healed that which was sick, neither have you comforted that which was broken, neither have you brought again that which strayed, neither have you sought that which was lost, and that which was strong you wore out with labour. And my sheep were scattered, because there were no shepherds: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field; and there was none who sought after them, nor brought them back. Therefore thus says the Lord, Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep of their hand, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to cease from feeding my sheep; neither shall they feed them any more: and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, and I will feed them with judgment.</q> </p>

<p>5. Lest, then, the sheep committed to us by the Lord be demanded back from our mouth, wherewith we deny peace, wherewith we oppose to them rather the severity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> cruelty than <em>the benignity</em> of divine and paternal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; we have determined  by the suggestion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and the admonition of the Lord, conveyed by many and manifest visions, because the enemy is foretold and shown to be at hand, to gather within the camp the soldiers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to examine the cases of each one, and to grant peace to the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, yea, rather to furnish arms to those who are about to fight. And this, we trust, will please you in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the paternal mercy. But if there be any (one) of our colleagues who, now that the contest is urgent, thinks that peace should not be granted to our brethren and sisters, he shall give an account to the Lord in the day of judgment, either of his grievous rigour or of his inhuman hardness. We, as befitted our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and charity and solicitude, have laid before you what was in our own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, namely, that the day of contest has approached, that a violent enemy will soon rise up against us, that a struggle is coming on, not such as it has been, but much more serious and fierce. This is frequently shown to us from above; concerning this we are often admonished by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and mercy of the Lord, of whose help and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we who trust in Him may be secure, because He who in peace foretells to His soldiers that the battle will come, will give to them when they are warring victory in the encounter. We bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>
