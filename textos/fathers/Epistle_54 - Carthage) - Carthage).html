<h1>Epistle 54</h1>

<p><strong>To Cornelius, Concerning Fortunatus and Felicissimus, or Against the Heretics.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian Chiefly Warns Cornelius in This Letter Not to Hear the Calumnies of Felicissimus and Fortunatus Against Him, and Not to Be Frightened by Their Threats, But to Be of a Brave Spirit, as Becomes God's Priests in Opposition to Heretics; Namely, Those Who, After the Custom Prevailing Among Heretics, Began Their Heresy and Schisms with the Contempt of One Bishop in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</em> </p>

<p>1. I have read your letter, dearest brother, which you sent by Saturus our brother the acolyte, abundantly full of fraternal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> reproof; in which you signified that Felicissimus,  no new enemy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but long ago <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for his very many and grave crimes, and condemned not only by my judgment, but also by that of very many of my fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, has been rejected by you there, and that when he came attended by a band and faction of desperadoes, he was driven from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with the full rigour with which it behooves a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to act. From which Church long ago he was driven, with others like himself, by the majesty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the severity of Christ our Lord and Judge; that the author of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and disagreement, the fraudulent user of money entrusted to him, the violator of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, the destroyer and corrupter of many marriages, should not, by the dishonour of his presence and his immodest and incestuous contact, violate further the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, hitherto uncorrupt, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, modest.</p>

<p>2. But yet, when I read your other letter, brother, which you subjoined to your first one, I was considerably surprised at observing that you were in some degree disturbed by the threats and terrors of those who had come, when, according to what you wrote, they had attacked and threatened you with the greatest desperation, that if you would not receive the letters which they had brought, they would read them publicly, and would utter many base and disgraceful things, and such as were worthy of their mouth. But if the matter is thus, dearest brother, that the audacity of the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men is to be dreaded, and that what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men cannot do rightly and equitably, they may accomplish by daring and desperation, there is an end of the vigour of the episcopacy, and of the sublime and divine power of governing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; nor can we continue any longer, or in fact now be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, if it has come to this, that we are to be afraid of the threats or the snares of outcasts. For both <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> threaten, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and all those, of whose hearts and minds the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has taken possession, daily attest their venomous <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> voice. We are not, therefore, to yield because they threaten; nor is the adversary and enemy on that account greater than Christ, because he claims for himself and assumes so much in the world. There ought to abide with us, dearest brother, an immoveable strength of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and against all the irruptions and onsets of the waves that roar against us, a steady and unshaken <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> should plant itself as with the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and mass of a resisting rock. Nor does it matter whence comes the terror or the danger to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who lives subject to terrors and dangers, and is nevertheless made <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> by those very terrors and dangers. For we ought not to consider and regard the mere threats of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when we see that the Lord Himself was deserted by His brethren, and was betrayed by him whom He Himself had chosen among His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; that also in the beginning of the world it was none other than a brother who slew righteous Abel, and an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> brother pursued the fleeing Jacob, and the youthful Joseph was sold by the act of his brethren. In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> also we read that it was foretold that our foes should rather be of our own household, and that they who have first been associated in the sacrament of unity  shall be they who shall betray one another. It makes no difference who delivers up or who rages, since God permits those to be delivered up whom He appoints to be crowned. For it is no ignominy to us to suffer from our brethren what Christ suffered, nor is it <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to them to do what Judas did. But what insolence it is in them, what swelling and inflated and vain boasting on the part of these threateners, <em>there</em> to threaten me in my absence, when here they have me present in their power! I do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> their reproaches with which they daily wound themselves and their own life; I do not tremble at their clubs and stones and swords, which they brandish with parricidal words: as far as lies in their power such men are homicides before God. Yet they are not able to slay unless the Lord have allowed them to slay; and although I must die but once, yet they daily slay me by their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, their words, and their villanies.</p>

<p>3. But, dearest brother, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline is not on that account to be forsaken, nor <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> censure to be relaxed, because we are disturbed with reproaches or are shaken with terrors; since <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> meets and warns us, saying, <q>But he who presumes and is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a>, the man who boasts of himself, who has enlarged his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, shall accomplish nothing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052483"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse5">Habakkuk&nbsp;2:5</a></span> And again: <q>And <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not the words of a sinful man, for his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall be dung and worms. Today he is lifted up, and tomorrow he shall not be found, because he is turned into his earth, and his thought shall perish.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052484"><a href="../bible/1ma002.htm#verse62">1&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;2:62-63</a></span> And again: <q>I have seen the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> exalted, and raised above the cedars of Libanus: I went by, and, lo, he was not; yea, I sought him, and his place was not found.</q>  Exaltation, and puffing up, and arrogant and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> boastfulness, spring not from the teaching of Christ who teaches humility, but from the spirit of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, whom the Lord rebukes by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, <q>For you have said in your heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will place my throne above the stars of God: I will sit on a lofty mountain, above the lofty mountains to the north: I will ascend above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052486"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;14:13-14</a></span> And he added, saying, <q>Yet you shall descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, to the foundations of the earth; and they that see you shall wonder at you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052487"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;14:15-16</a></span> Whence also <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> threatens a like punishment to such in another place, and says, <q>For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is injurious and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and upon every one that is lifted up, and lofty.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052488"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse12">Isaiah 2:12</a></span> By his mouth, therefore, and by his words, is every one at once betrayed; and whether he has Christ in his heart, or <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, is discerned in his speaking, according to what the Lord says in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>O generation of vipers, how can you, being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man out of the good treasure brings forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; and an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> man out of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> treasure brings forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052489"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse34">Matthew 12:34-35</a></span> Whence also that rich sinner who implores help from Lazarus, then laid in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, and established in a place of comfort, while he, writhing in torments, is consumed by the heats of burning flame, suffers most punishment of all parts of his body in his mouth and his tongue, because doubtless in his mouth and his tongue he had most <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. </p>

<p>4. For since it is written, <q>Neither shall revilers inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052491"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 6:10</a></span> and again the Lord says in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>Whosoever shall say to his brother, You fool; and whosoever shall say, Raca, shall be in danger of the Gehenna of fire,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052492"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22</a></span> how can they evade the rebuke of the Lord the avenger, who heap up such expressions, not only on their brethren, but also on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to whom is granted such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the condescension of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that whosoever should not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and him that judges here for the time, was immediately to be slain? In Deuteronomy the Lord God speaks, saying, <q>And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or to the judge, whosoever he shall be in those days, that man shall die; and all the people, when they hear, shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and shall do no more wickedly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052493"><a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy 17:12-13</a></span> Moreover, to Samuel when he was despised by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, God says; <q>They have not despised you, but they have despised me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052494"><a href="../bible/1sa008.htm#verse7">1 Samuel 8:7</a></span> And the Lord also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says, <q>He that hears you, hears me, and Him that sent me; and he that rejects you, rejects me; and he that rejects me, rejects Him that sent me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052495"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse16">Luke 10:16</a></span> And when he had cleansed the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprous</a> man, he said, <q>Go, show yourself to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052496"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse4">Matthew 8:4</a></span> And when afterwards, in the time of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, He had received a buffet from a servant of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the servant said to Him, <q>Do you answer the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> so? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052497"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse22">John 18:22</a></span> the Lord said nothing reproachfully against the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, nor detracted anything from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; but rather asserting His own innocence, and showing it, He says, <q>If I have spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but if well, why do you smite me? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052498"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse23">John 18:23</a></span> Also subsequently, in the Acts of the Apostles, the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, when it was said to him, <q>Do you revile God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052499"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse4">Acts 23:4</a></span> &mdash; although they had begun to be <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>, and impious, and bloody, the Lord having already been crucified, and had no longer retained anything of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and authority&mdash; yet <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, considering the name itself, however empty, and the shadow, as it were, of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, said, <q>I knew not, brethren, that he was the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>: for it is written, You shall not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the ruler of your, people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052500"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse5">Acts 23:5</a></span></p>

<p>5. When, then, such and so great examples, and many others, are precedents whereby the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> authority and power by the divine condescension is established, what kind of people, think you, are they who, being enemies of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and rebels against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are frightened neither by the threatening of a forewarning Lord, nor by the vengeance of coming judgment? For neither have <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> arisen, nor have schisms originated, from any other source than from this, that God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>; nor do they consider that there is one person for the time <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and for the time judge in the stead of Christ;  whom, if, according to divine teaching, the whole fraternity should <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, no one would stir up anything against the college of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; no one, after the divine judgment, after the suffrage of the people, after the consent of the co-bishops, would make himself a judge, not now of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. No one would rend the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by a division of the unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  No one, pleasing himself, and swelling with arrogance, would found a new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, separate and without, unless any one be of such <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> daring and abandoned <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as to think that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is made without God's judgment, when the Lord says in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them does not fall to the ground without the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of your Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052503"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse29">Matthew 10:29</a></span> When He says that not even the least things are done without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, does any one think that the highest and greatest things are done in God's Church either without God's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or permission, and that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>&mdash; that is, His stewards&mdash; are not ordained by His decree? This is not to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby we live; this is not to give <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whose direction and decision we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that all things are ruled and governed. Undoubtedly there are <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> made, not by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but they are such as are made outside of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash; such as are made contrary to the ordinance and tradition of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, as the Lord Himself in the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> asserts, saying, <q>They have set up a king for themselves, and not by me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052504"><a href="../bible/hos008.htm#verse4">Hosea 8:4</a></span> And again: <q>Their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are as the bread of mourning; all that eat thereof shall be polluted.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052505"><a href="../bible/hos009.htm#verse4">Hosea 9:4</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also cries by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, and says, <q>Woe unto you, children that are deserters. Thus says the Lord, You have taken counsel, but not of me; and you have made a covenant, but not of my Spirit, that you may add <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052506"><a href="../bible/isa030.htm#verse1">Isaiah 30:1</a></span></p>

<p>6. But&mdash; I speak to you as being provoked; I speak as grieving; I speak as constrained&mdash; when a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is appointed into the place of one deceased, when he is chosen in time of peace by the suffrage of an entire people, when he is protected by the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, faithfully linked with all his colleagues, approved to his people by now four years' experience in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>; observant of discipline in time of peace; in time of disturbance, proscribed with the name of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> applied and attached to him; so often asked for in the circus <q>for the lions; </q>in the amphitheatre, honoured with the testimony of the divine condescension; even in these very days on which I have written this letter to you, on account of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which, by proclaimed edict, the people were commanded to celebrate, demanded anew in the circus <q>for the lions</q> by the clamour of the populace&mdash;when such a one, dearest brother, is seen to be assailed by some desperate and reckless men, and by those who have their place outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is manifest who assails him: not assuredly Christ, who either appoints or protects his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; but he who, as the adversary of Christ and the foe to His Church, for this purpose persecutes with his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that when the pilot is removed, he may rage more atrociously and more violently with a view to the Church's dispersion.</p>

<p>7. Nor ought it, my dearest brother, to disturb any one who is faithful and mindful of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and retains the commands of the apostle who forewarns us; if in the last days certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, contumacious, and enemies of God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, either depart from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or act against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since both the Lord and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> have previously foretold that there should be such. Nor let any one wonder that the servant placed over them should be forsaken by some, when His own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> forsook the Lord Himself, who performed such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">great and wonderful works</a>, and illustrated the attributes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father by the testimony of His doings. And yet He did not rebuke them when they went away, nor even severely threaten them; but rather, turning to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, He said, <q>Will you also go away? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052507"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse67">John 6:67</a></span> manifestly observing the law whereby a man left to his own liberty, and established in his own choice, himself desires for himself either death or <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Nevertheless, Peter,  upon whom by the same Lord the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had been built, speaking one for all, and answering with the voice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, says, <q>Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and are sure that You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God: </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052509"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse13">Matthew 15:13</a></span> signifying, doubtless, and showing that those who departed from Christ perished by their own fault, yet that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which believes on Christ, and holds that which it has once learned, never departs from Him at all, and that those are the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who remain in the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but that, on the other hand, they are not the plantation planted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, whom we see not to be established with the stability of wheat, but blown about like chaff by the breath of the enemy scattering them, of whom John also in his epistle says, <q>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they would have continued with us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052510"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse19">1 John 2:19</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also warns us, when <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men perish out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not to be disturbed, nor to let our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be lessened by the departure of the faithless. <q>For what,</q> he says, <q>if some of them have departed from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Hath their unbelief made the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of God of none effect? God forbid! For God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but every man a liar.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052511"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse3">Romans 3:3-4</a></span></p>

<p>8. For our own part, it befits our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, dearest brother, to strive that none should perish <em>going</em> out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by our fault; but if any one, of his own accord and by his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, should perish, and should be unwilling to repent and to return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that we who are anxious for their well-being should be blameless in the day of judgment, and that they alone should remain in punishment who refused to be healed by the wholesomeness of our advice. Nor ought the reproaches of the lost to move us in any degree to depart from the right path and from the sure rule, since also the apostle instructs us, saying, <q>If I should please men, I should not be the servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052512"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse10">Galatians 1:10</a></span> There is a great difference whether one desires to deserve well of men or of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If we seek to please men, the Lord is offended. But if we strive and labour that we may please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we ought to contemn <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reproaches and abuse.</p>

<p>9. But that I did not immediately write to you, dearest brother, about Fortunatus, that pseudo-<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, constituted by a few, and those, inveterate <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the matter was not such as ought at once and hastily to be brought under your notice, as if it were great or to be feared; especially since you already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well enough the name of Fortunatus, who is one of the five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who some time back deserted from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and were lately <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the judgment of our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>,  men both numerous and entitled to the greatest respect, who on this matter wrote to you last year. Also you would recognise Felicissimus, the standard-bearer of sedition, who himself also is comprised in those same letters long ago written to you by our co-bishops,  and who not only was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by them here, but moreover was lately driven from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by you there. Since I was confident that these things were in your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> for certain that they abode in your memory and discipline, I did not think it necessary that the follies of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be told you quickly and urgently. For indeed it ought not to pertain to the majesty or the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to concern itself with what the audacity of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics may attempt among themselves. For <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian's</a> party is also said to have now made Maximus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>&mdash; who was lately sent to us as an ambassador for <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, and rejected from communion with us&mdash; their false <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in that place; and yet I had not written to you about this, since all these things are slighted by us; and I had sent to you lately the names of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appointed there, who with wholesome and sound discipline govern the brethren in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  And this certainly, therefore, it was decided by the advice of all of us to write to you, that there might be found a short method of destroying <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and of finding out <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that you and our colleagues might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to whom to write, and reciprocally, from whom it behooved you to receive letters; but if any one, except those whom we have comprised in our letter, should dare to write to you, you would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> either that he was polluted by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, or by receiving a certificate, or that he was one of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and therefore perverted and profane. Nevertheless, having gained an opportunity, by means of a very great friend and a clerk, I have written to you by Felicianus the acolyte, whom you had sent with Perseus our colleague, among other matters which were to be brought under your notice from their party, about that Fortunatus also. But while our brother Felicianus is either retarded there by the wind or is detained by receiving other letters from us, he has been forestalled by Felicissimus hastening to you. For thus <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> always hastens, as if by its speed it could prevail against innocence.</p>

<p>10. But I intimated to you, my brother, by Felicianus, that there had come to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Privatus, an old <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> in the colony of Lambesa, many years ago condemned for many and grave crimes by the judgment of ninety <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and severely remarked upon in the letters of Fabian and Donatus, also our predecessors, as is not hidden from your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>;  who, when he said that he wished to plead his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> before us in the council which we held on the Ides of May then past, and was not permitted, made for himself that Fortunatus a pretended <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, worthy of his college. And there had also come with him a certain Felix, whom he himself had formerly appointed a pseudo-<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. But Jovinus also, and Maximus, were present as companions with the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>,  condemned for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and crimes <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> against them by the judgment of nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, our colleagues, and again <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> also by many of us last year in a council. And with these four was also joined Repostus of Suturnica, who not only fell himself in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, but cast down by <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> persuasion the greatest part of his people. These five, with a few who either had <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, or had <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a>, concurred in desiring Fortunatus as a false <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for themselves, that so, their crimes agreeing, the ruler should be such as those who are ruled.</p>

<p>11. Hence also, dearest brother, you may now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the other falsehoods which desperate and abandoned men have there spread about, that although, of the sacrificers, or of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, there were not more than five false <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who came to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and appointed Fortunatus as the associate of their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>; yet they, as children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and full of lies, dared, as you write, to boast that there were present twenty-five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; which <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> they boasted here also before among our brethren, saying that twenty-five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> would come from Numidia to make a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for them. After they were detected and confounded in this their lie (only five who had made shipwreck coming together, and these being <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by us), they sailed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the reward of their lies, as if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> could not sail after them, and convict their lying tongues by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the certainty. And this, my brother, is real <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, not to think nor to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that lies do not long deceive, that the night only lasts so long as until the day brightens; but that when the day is clear and the sun has arisen, the darkness and gloom give place to light, and the robberies which were going on through the night cease. In fine, if you were to seek the names from them, they would have none which they could even <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> give. For such among them is the penury even of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, that neither of sacrificers nor of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> can there be collected twenty-five for them; and yet, for the sake of deceiving the ears of the simple and the absent, the number is exaggerated by a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, as if, even if this number were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, either the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would be overcome by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or righteousness by the unrighteous.</p>

<p>12. Nor does it behoove me, dearest brother, to do like things to them, and to go through in my discourse those things which they have committed, and still commit, since we have to consider what it becomes God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to utter and to write. Nor ought grief to speak among us so much as shame, and I ought not to seem provoked rather to heap together reproaches than crimes and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore I am silent upon the deceits practised in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. I pass over the conspiracies and adulteries, and the various kinds of crimes. That circumstance alone, however, of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not mine, nor man's, but God's, I do not think must be withheld; that from the very first day of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, while the recent crimes of the guilty were still hot, and not only the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> altars, but the very hands and the mouths of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, were still smoking with the abominable <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, they did not cease to communicate with the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, and to interfere with their repentance. God cries, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> unto any gods, save unto the Lord only, shall be rooted out.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052518"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse20">Exodus 22:20</a></span> And in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the Lord says, <q>Whosoever shall deny me, him will I deny.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052519"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse33">Matthew 10:33</a></span> And in another place the divine indignation and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> are not silent, saying, <q>To them have you poured out a drink-offering, and to them have you offered a meat-offering. Shall I not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with these things? Says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052520"><a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse6">Isaiah 57:6</a></span> And they interfere that God may not be entreated, who Himself declares that He is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>; they interpose that Christ may not be besought with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and satisfactions, who professes that him who denies Him He will deny.</p>

<p>13. In the very time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> we wrote letters on this matter, but we were not attended to. A full council being held, we decreed, not only with our consent, but also with our threatening, that the brethren should repent,  and that none should rashly grant peace to those who did not repent. And those <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> rush with impious <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> against God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, departing from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and raising their parricidal arms against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in order that the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> may consummate their work,  take pains that the divine clemency may not heal the wounded in His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. They corrupt the repentance of the wretched men by the deceitfulness of their lies, that it may not satisfy an offended God&mdash; that he who has either blushed or feared to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> before, may not afterwards seek Christ his Lord, nor he return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who had departed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Efforts are used that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may not be atoned for with just satisfactions and lamentations, that the wounds may not be washed away with tears. True peace is done away by the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of a false peace; the healthful bosom of a mother is closed by the interference of the stepmother, that weeping and groaning may not be heard from the breast and from the lips of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>. And beyond this, the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> are compelled with their tongues and lips, in the Capitol  wherein before they had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, to reproach the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>&mdash; to assail with contumelies and with abusive words the confessors and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and those righteous men who are most eminent for the praise of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. By which things, indeed, it is not so much the modesty and the humility and the shame of our people that are smitten, as their own hope and life that are lacerated. For neither is it he who hears, but he who utters the reproach, that is wretched; nor is it he who is smitten by his brother, but he who smites a brother, that is a sinner under the law; and when the guilty do a wrong to the innocent, they suffer the injury who think that they are doing it. Finally, their mind is smitten by these things, and their spirit is dull, and their sense of right is estranged: it is God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> that they do not perceive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, lest repentance should follow as it is written, <q>And God gave them the spirit of torpor,</q>  that is, that they may not return and be healed, and be made whole after their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by just <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and satisfactions. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle in his epistle lays it down, and says, <q>They received not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that they might be saved. And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> God shall send them strong delusion, that they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>: that they all might be judged who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052525"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse10">2 Thessalonians 2:10-12</a></span> The highest degree of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is, not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; the second, to acknowledge our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. In the former, innocence flows pure and unstained to preserve us; in the latter, there comes a medicine to heal us. Both of these they have lost by offending <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both because the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is lost which is received from the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and repentance comes not to their help, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is healed. Think you, brother, that their wickednesses against God are trifling, their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> small and moderate&mdash; since by their means the majesty of an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> God is not besought, since the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and the fire and the day of the Lord is not feared&mdash; since, when <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> is at hand the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the militant people is disarmed by the taking away of the power of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? Let the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> see to it how they may amend this.  A heavier labour is incumbent on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in asserting and maintaining the majesty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we seem not to neglect anything in this respect, when God admonishes us, and says, <q>And now, O you <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, this commandment is for you. If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> unto my name, says the Lord, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052527"><a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse1">Malachi 2:1-2</a></span> Is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, then, given to God when the majesty and decree of God are so condemned, that when He declares that He is indignant and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with those who <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and when He threatens <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> penalties and perpetual punishments, it is proposed by the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>, and said, Let not the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God be considered, let not the judgment of the Lord be feared, let not any knock at the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; but repentance being done away with, and no confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being made, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> being despised and trodden under foot, let peace be proclaimed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in deceitful words; and lest the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> should rise up, or those placed without should return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let communion be offered to those who are not in communion?</p>

<p>14. To these also it was not sufficient that they had withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that they had taken away from the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> the hope of satisfaction and repentance, that they had taken away those involved in frauds or stained with adulteries, or polluted with the deadly contagion of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, lest they should entreat <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or make confession of their crimes in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, from all feeling and fruit of repentance; that they had set up  outside for themselves&mdash; outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and opposed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a conventicle of their abandoned faction, when there had flowed together a band of creatures with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a>, and unwilling to entreat and to satisfy God. After such things as these, moreover, they still dare&mdash; a false <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> having been appointed for them by, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>&mdash; to set sail and to bear letters from schismatic and profane <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to the throne of Peter, and to the chief church whence <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> unity takes its source;  and not to consider that these were the Romans whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was praised in the preaching of the apostle, to whom faithlessness could have no access.  But what was the reason of their coming and announcing the making of the pseudo-<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>? For either they are pleased with what they have done, and persist in their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; or, if they are displeased and retreat, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whither they may return. For, as it has been decreed by all of us  &mdash; and is equally fair and just&mdash; that the case of every one should be heard there where the crime has been committed; and a portion of the flock has been assigned to each individual pastor, which he is to rule and govern, having to give account of his doing to the Lord; it certainly behooves those over whom we are placed not to run about nor to break up the harmonious agreement of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with their crafty and deceitful rashness, but there to plead their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, where they may be able to have both accusers and witnesses of their crime; unless perchance the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> constituted in Africa seems to a few desperate and abandoned men to be too little,  who have already judged concerning them, and have lately condemned, by the gravity of their judgment, their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bound in many bonds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Already their case has been examined, already sentence concerning them has been pronounced; nor is it fitting for the dignity of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to be blamed for the levity of a changeable and inconstant <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, when the Lord teaches and says, <q>Let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052533"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse37">Matthew 5:37</a></span></p>

<p>15. If the number of those who judged concerning them last year be reckoned with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, then there were more present to the judgment and hearing than are those very same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who now seem to be associated with Fortunatus. For you ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, dearest brother, that after he was made a pseudo-<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, he was at once deserted by almost all. For those to whom in past time delusions were offered, and deceitful words were given, to the effect that they were to return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> together; after they saw that a false <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was made there, learned that they had been fooled and deceived, and are daily returning and knocking at the <em>door of the</em> Church; while we, meanwhile, by whom account is to be given to the Lord, are anxiously weighing and carefully examining who ought to be received and admitted into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For some are either hindered by their crimes to such a degree, or they are so obstinately and firmly opposed by their brethren, that they cannot be received at all except with offense and risk to a great many, For neither must some putridities be so collected and brought together, that the parts which are sound and whole should be injured; nor is that pastor serviceable or wise who so mingles the diseased and affected sheep with his flock as to contaminate the whole flock with the infection of the clinging <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. (Do not pay attention to their number.  For one who fears God is better than a thousand impious sons, as the Lord spoke by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, <q>O son, do not delight in ungodly sons, though they multiply to you, except the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord be with them.</q> ) Oh, if you could, dearest brother, be with us here when those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and perverse men return from <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, you would see what labour is mine to persuade patience to our brethren, that they should calm their grief of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and consent to receive and heal the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For as they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and are glad when those who are endurable and less guilty return, so, on the other hand, they murmur and are dissatisfied as often as the incorrigible and violent, and those who are contaminated either by adulteries or by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and who, in addition to this, are <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> besides, so return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as to corrupt the good dispositions within it. Scarcely do I persuade the people; nay, I extort it from them, that they should suffer such to be admitted. And the grief of the fraternity is made the more just, from the fact that one and another who, notwithstanding the opposition and contradiction of the people, have been received by my facility, have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> worse than they had been before, and have not been able to keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of their repentance, because they had not come with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance.</p>

<p>16. But what am I to say of those who have now sailed to you with Felicissimus, guilty of every crime, as ambassadors sent by Fortunatus the pseudo-<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, bringing to you letters as false as he himself is false, whose letters they bring, as his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is full of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as his life is execrable, as it is disgraceful; so that, even if they were in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, such people ought to be expelled from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In addition, since they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> their own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, they do not dare to come to us or to approach to the I threshold of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but wander about, without her, through the province, for the sake of circumventing and defrauding the brethren; and now, being sufficiently <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all, and everywhere excluded for their crimes, they sail there also to you. For they cannot have the face to approach to us, or to stand before us, since the crimes which are charged upon them by the brethren are most grievous and grave. If they wish to undergo our judgment, let them come. Finally, if they can find any excuse or defence. let us see what thought they have of making satisfaction, what fruit of repentance they bring forward. The Church is neither closed here to any one, nor is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> denied to any. Our patience, and facility, and humanity are ready for those who come. I entreat all to return into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. I beg all our fellow-soldiers to be included within the camp of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the dwelling-place of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. I remit everything. I shut my eyes to many things, with the desire and the wish to gather together the brotherhood. Even those things which are committed against God I do not investigate with the full judgment of religion. I almost <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> myself, in remitting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>  more than I ought. I embrace with prompt and full <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those who return with repentance, confessing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with lowly and unaffected atonement. </p>

<p>17. But if there are some who think that they can return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> not with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> but with threats, or suppose that they can make a way for themselves, not with lamentation and atonements, but with terrors, let them take it for certain that against such the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord stands closed; nor does the camp of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, unconquered and firm with the Lord's protection, yield to threats. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of God holding fast the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and keeping Christ's precepts may be slain; he cannot be conquered. Zacharias, God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, suggests and furnishes to us examples of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who, when he could not be terrified with threats and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a>, was slain in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at the same time crying out and saying, what we also cry out and say against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <q>Thus says the Lord, You have forsaken the ways of the Lord, and the Lord will forsake you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052538"><a href="../bible/2ch024.htm#verse20">2 Chronicles 24:20</a></span> For because a few rash and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men forsake the heavenly and wholesome ways of the Lord, and not doing <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things are deserted by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, we also ought not therefore to be unmindful of the divine tradition, so as to think that the crimes of madmen are greater than the judgments of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; or conceive that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> endeavours can do more to attack, than divine protection avails to defend.</p>

<p>18. Is the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, dearest brother, to be laid aside, is the faithful and uncorrupted majesty of the people placed within it,  and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> authority and power also, all to be laid aside for this, that those who are set without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may say that they wish to judge concerning a prelate in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> concerning a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? Wounded men about a whole man? Maimed concerning a sound man? Lapsed concerning one who stands fast? Guilty concerning their judge? <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> men concerning a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>? What is left but that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should yield to the Capitol, and that, while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> depart and remove the Lord's altar, the images and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> should pass over with their altars into the sacred and venerable assembly of our <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and a larger and fuller material for declaiming against us and abusing us be afforded to <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>; if they who have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> and have publicly denied Christ should begin not only to be entreated and admitted without penance done, but, moreover, in addition, to domineer by the power of their terror?</p>

<p>19. If they desire peace, let them lay aside their arms. If they make atonement, why do they threaten? Or if they threaten, let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are not feared by God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. For even <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, when he shall begin to come, shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> because he threatens; neither shall we yield to his arms and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, because he declares that he will destroy us if we resist. Heretics arm us when they think that we are terrified by their threatenings; nor do they cast us down on our face, but rather they lift us up and inflame us, when they make peace itself worse to the brethren than <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. And we desire, indeed, that they may not fill up with crime what they speak in <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, that they who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with perfidious and cruel words may not also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and beseech <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom they do not cease to provoke and exasperate, that He will soften their hearts, that they may lay aside their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and return to soundness of mind; that their breasts, covered over with the darkness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, may acknowledge the light of repentance, and that they may rather seek that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may be poured out on their behalf, than themselves pour out the blood of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But if they continue in their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and cruelly persevere in these their parricidal deceits and threats, no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of God is so weak, so prostrate, and so abject, so inefficient by the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, as not to be aroused against the enemies and impugners of God by strength from above; as not to find his humility and weakness animated by the vigour and strength of the Lord who protects him. It matters nothing to us by whom, or when we are slain, since we shall receive from the Lord the reward of our death and of our blood. Their <em>concision</em>  is to be mourned and lamented, whom the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> so blinds, that, without considering the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishments of Gehenna, they endeavour to imitate the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, who is now approaching.</p>

<p>20. And although I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, dearest brother, from the mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which we owe and manifest one towards another, that you always read my letters to the very distinguished <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who preside with you there,  and to your very <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and large congregation,  yet now I both warn and ask you to do by my request what at other times you do of your own accord and courtesy; that so, by the reading of this my letter, if any contagion of envenomed speech and of pestilent propagation has crept in there, it may be all purged out of the ears and of the hearts of the brethren, and the sound and sincere affection of the good may be cleansed anew from all the filth of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> disparagement.</p>

<p>21. But for the rest, let our most beloved brethren firmly decline, and avoid the words and conversations of those whose word creeps onwards like a cancer; as the apostle says, <q>Evil communications corrupt good manners.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052543"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse33">1 Corinthians 15:33</a></span> And again: <q>A man that is an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, after one admonition, reject: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he that is such is subverted, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, being condemned of himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052544"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse10">Titus 3:10-11</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> speaks by Solomon, saying, <q>A perverse man carries perdition in his mouth; and in his lips he hides a fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052545"><a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse27">Proverbs 16:27</a></span> Also again, he warns us, and says, <q>Hedge in your ears with thorns, and hearken not to a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> tongue.</q>  And again: <q>A <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> doer gives heed to the tongue of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>; but a righteous man does not listen to lying lips.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052547"><a href="../bible/pro017.htm#verse4">Proverbs 17:4</a></span> And although I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that our brotherhood there,  assuredly fortified by your foresight, and besides sufficiently cautious by their own vigilance, cannot be taken nor deceived by the poisons of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and that the teachings and precepts of God prevail with them only in proportion as the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God is in them; yet, even although needlessly, either my solicitude or my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> persuaded me to write these things to you, that no commerce should be entered into with such; that no banquets nor conferences be entertained with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; but that we should be as much separated from them, as they are deserters from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; because it is written, <q>If he shall neglect to hear the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let him be unto you as a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> man and a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052549"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse17">Matthew 18:17</a></span> And the blessed apostle not only warns, but also commands us to withdraw from such. <q>We command you,</q> he says, <q>in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.</q>  There can be no fellowship between <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and I faithlessness. He who is not with Christ, who is an adversary of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is hostile to His unity and peace, cannot be associated with us. If they come with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and atonements, let them be heard; if they heap together curses and threats, let them be rejected. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell. </p>
