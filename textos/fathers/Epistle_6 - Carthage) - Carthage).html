<h1>Epistle 6</h1>

<p><strong>To Rogatianus the Presbyter, and the Other Confessors. A.D. 250.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; He Exhorts Rogatianus and the Other Confessors to Maintain Discipline, that None Who Had Confessed Christ in Word Should Seem to Deny Him in Deed; Casually Rebuking Some of Them, Who, Being Exiled on Account of the Faith, Were Not Afraid to Return Unbidden into Their Country.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Rogatianus, and to the other confessors, his brethren, greeting. I had both heretofore, dearly beloved and bravest brethren, sent you a letter, in which I congratulated your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with exulting words, and now my voice has no other object, first of all, than with joyous <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, repeatedly and always to announce the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of your name. For what can I wish greater or better in my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> than to see the flock of Christ enlightened by the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of your confession? For although all the brethren ought to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in this, yet, in the common <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, the share of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the greatest. For the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.  In proportion as we grieve over those whom a hostile <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> has cast down, in the same proportion we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over you whom the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has not been able to over-Conic.</p>

<p>2. Yet I exhort you by our common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and simple <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of my heart towards you, that, having overcome the adversary in this first encounter, you should hold fast your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with a brave and persevering <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. We are still in the world; we are still placed in the battlefield; we fight daily for our lives. Care must be taken, that after such beginnings as these there should also come an increase, and that what you have begun to be with such a blessed commencement should be consummated in you. It is a slight thing to have been able to attain anything; it is more to be able to keep what you have attained; even as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself and saving birth makes alive, not by being received, but by being preserved. Nor is it actually the attainment, but the perfecting, that keeps a man for God. The Lord taught this in His instruction when He said, <q>Behold, you are made whole; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more, lest a worse thing come unto you.</q>  Conceive of Him as saying this also to His confessor, <q>Lo you are made a confessor; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more, lest a worse thing come unto you.</q> Solomon also, and Saul, and many others, so long as they walked in the Lord's ways, were able to keep the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given to them. When the discipline of the Lord was forsaken by them, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> also forsook them.</p>

<p>3. We must persevere in the straight and narrow road of praise and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and since peacefulness and humility and the tranquillity of a good life is fitting for all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, according to the word of the Lord, who looks to none other man than <q>to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembles at</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052114"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;66:2</a></span> His word, it the more behooves you confessors, who have been made an example to the rest of the brethren, to observe and fulfil this, as being those whose characters should provoke to imitation the life and conduct of all. For as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were alienated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as those on whose account <q>the name of God is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052115"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;2:24</a></span> so on the other hand those are dear to God through whose conformity to discipline the name of God is declared with a testimony of praise, as it is written, the Lord Himself forewarning and saying, <q>Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</q>  And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle says, <q>Shine as lights in the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052117"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> And similarly Peter exhorts: <q>As strangers,</q> says he, <q>and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, having your conversation honest among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; that whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052118"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:11-12</a></span> This, indeed, the greatest part of you, I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to say, are careful for; and, made better by the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of your confession itself, guard and preserve its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by tranquil and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> lives.</p>

<p>4. But I hear that some infect your number, and destroy the praise of a distinguished name by their corrupt conversation; whom you yourselves, even as being lovers and guardians of your own praise, should rebuke and check and correct. For what a disgrace is suffered by your name, when one spends his days in intoxication and debauchery,  another returns to that country whence he was banished, to perish when arrested, not now as being a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but as being a criminal!  I hear that some are puffed up and are arrogant, although it is written, <q>Be not high-minded, but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest He also spare not you.</q>  Our Lord <q>was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before her shearers is dumb, so He opened not His mouth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052122"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah 53:7</a></span> <q>I am not rebellious,</q> says He, <q>neither do I gainsay. I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to the palms of their hands. I hid not my face from the filthiness of spitting.</q>  And dares any one now, who lives by and in this very One, lift up himself and be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a>, forgetful, as well of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which He did, as of the commands which He left to us either by Himself or by His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? But if <q>the servant is not greater than his Lord.</q>  let those who follow the Lord humbly and peacefully and silently tread in His steps, since the lower one is, the more exalted be may become; as says the Lord, <q>He that is least among you, the same shall be great.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052125"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse48">Luke 9:48</a></span></p>

<p>5. What, then, is that&mdash; how execrable should it appear to you&mdash; which I have learned with extreme anguish and grief of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to wit, that there are not wanting those who defile the temples of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the members sanctified after confession and made <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>,  with a disgraceful and <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> concubinage, associating their beds promiscuously with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a>! In which, even if there be no pollution of their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, there is a great guilt in this very thing, that by their offense originate examples for the ruin of Others.  There ought also to be no contentions and emulations among you, since the Lord left to us His peace, and it is written, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052128"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus 19:18</a></span> <q>But if you bite and find fault with one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052129"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse39">Matthew 22:39</a></span> From abuse and revilings also I entreat you to abstain, for <q>revilers do not attain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; </q>  and the tongue which has confessed Christ should be preserved sound and pure with its <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. For he who, according to Christ's precept, speaks things peaceable and good and just, daily confesses Christ. We had renounced the world when we were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; but we have now indeed renounced the world when tried and approved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we leave all that we have, and have followed the Lord, and stand and live in His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>

<p>6. Let us confirm one another by mutual exhortations, and let us more and more go forward in the Lord; so that when of His mercy He shall have made that peace which He promises to give, we may return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> new and almost changed men, and may be received, whether by our brethren or by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, in all things corrected and renewed for the better; and those who formerly admired our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in our <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> may now admire the discipline in our lives.  I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell; and be mindful of me.</p>
