<h1>Epistle 61</h1>

<p><strong>To Pomponius, Concerning Some Virgins.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian, with Some of His Colleagues, Replies to His Colleague Pomponius, that Virgins Who Had Determined to Maintain Their State with Continency and Firmness, But Who Had Yet Subsequently Been Found in the Same Bed with Men, If They Were Still Found to Be Virgins, Should Be Received into Communion and Admitted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But If Otherwise, Since They are Adulterous Towards Christ, They Should Be Compelled to Full Repentance, and Those Who Should Obstinately Persevere Should Be Ejected from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian, Caecilius, Victor, Sedatus, Tertullus, with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who were present with them, to Pomponius their brother, greeting. We have read, dearest brother, your letter which you sent by Paconius our brother, asking and desiring us to write again to you, and say what we thought of those <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who, after having once determined to continue in their condition, and firmly to maintain their continency, have afterwards been found to have remained in the same bed side by side with men; of whom you say that one is a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>; and yet that the same <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who have confessed that they have slept with men declare that they are chaste.  Concerning which matters, since you have desired our advice, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we do not depart from the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but with constancy and firmness take counsel for our brethren and sisters, and maintain the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by all the ways of usefulness and safety, since the Lord speaks, saying, <q>And I will give you pastors according to. mine heart, and they shall feed you with discipline.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052606"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse15">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:15</a></span> And again it is written; <q>Whoever despises discipline is miserable;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052607"><a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse11">Wisdom&nbsp;3:11</a></span> and in the Psalms also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> admonishes and instructs us, saying, <q>Keep discipline, lest haply the Lord be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and you perish from the right way, when His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> shall quickly burn against you.</q> </p>

<p>2. In the first place, therefore, dearest brother, both by overseers and people nothing is to be more eagerly sought after, than that we who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God should keep the divine precepts with every observation of discipline, and should not suffer our brethren to stray, and to live according to their own fancy and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>;  but that we should faithfully consult for the life of each one, and not stiffer <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to dwell with men,&mdash; I do not say to sleep together, but to live together  &mdash; since both their weak sex and their age, still critical, ought to be bridled in all things and ruled by us, lest an occasion should be given to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who ensnares us, and desires to rage over us, to hurt them, since the apostle also says, <q>Do not give place to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052611"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse27">Ephesians&nbsp;4:27</a></span> The ship is watchfully to be delivered from perilous places, that it may not be broken among the rocks and cliffs; the baggage must swiftly be taken out of the fire, before it is burnt up by the flames reaching it. No one who is near to danger is long safe, nor will the servant of God be able to escape the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> if he has entangled himself in the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> nets. We must interfere at once with such as these, that they may be separated while yet they can be separated in innocence; because by and by they will not be able to be separated by our interference, after they have become joined together by a very guilty <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Moreover, what a number of serious mischiefs we see to have arisen hence; and what a multitude of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> we behold corrupted by unlawful and dangerous conjunctions of this kind, to our great grief of mind! But if they have faithfully dedicated themselves to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let them persevere in modesty and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, without incurring any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report, and so in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and steadiness await the reward of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. But if they are unwilling or unable to persevere, it is better that they should marry, than that by their crimes they should fall into the fire. Certainly let them not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a scandal to the brethren or sisters, since it is written, <q>If meat <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052612"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:13</a></span> </p>

<p>3. Nor let any one think that she can be defended by this excuse, that she may be examined and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> whether she be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; since both the hands and the eyes of the midwives are often deceived; and if she be found to be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in that particular in which a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> may be so, yet she may have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in some other part of her body, which may be corrupted and yet cannot be examined. Assuredly the mere lying together, the mere embracing, the very talking together, and the act of kissing, and the disgraceful and foul slumber of two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> lying together, how much of dishonour and crime does it confess! If a husband come upon his wife, and see her lying with another man, is he not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and raging, and by the passion of his rage does he not perhaps take his sword into his hand? And what shall Christ and our Lord and Judge think, when He sees His virgin, dedicated to Him, and destined for His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, lying with another? How indignant and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> is He, and what penalties does He threaten against such unchaste connections! Whose spiritual sword and the coming day of judgment, that every one of the brethren may be able to escape, we ought with all our counsel to provide and to strive. And since it behooves all by all means to keep discipline,  much more is it right that overseers and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> should be careful for this, that they may afford an example and instruction to others concerning their conversation and character. For how can they direct the integrity and continence of others, if the corruptions and teachings of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> begin to proceed from themselves?</p>

<p>4. And therefore you have acted advisedly and with vigour, dearest brother, in excommunicating the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who has often abode with a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; and, moreover, the others who had been used to sleep with <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. But if they have repented of this their unlawful lying together, and have mutually withdrawn from one another, let the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> meantime be carefully inspected by midwives; and if they should be found <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, let them be received to communion, and admitted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; yet with this threatening, that if subsequently they should return to the same men, or if they should dwell together with the same men in one house or under the same roof, they should be ejected with a severer censure, nor should such be afterwards easily received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But if any one of them be found to be corrupted, let her abundantly repent, because she who has been guilty of this crime is an adulteress, not (indeed) against a husband, but against Christ; and therefore, a due time being appointed, let her afterwards, when confession has been made, return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But if they obstinately persevere, and do not mutually separate themselves, let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, with this their immodest obstinacy, they can never be admitted by us into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, lest they should begin to set an example to others to go to ruin by their crimes. Nor let them think that the way of life or of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is still open to them, if they have refused to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, since in Deuteronomy the Lord God says, <q>And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or judge, whosoever be shall be in those days, that man shall die, and all the people shall hear and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and do no more presumptuously.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052614"><a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy 17:12-13</a></span> God commanded those who did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to be slain, and those who did not hearken to His judges who were appointed for the time. And then indeed they were slain with the sword, when the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the flesh was yet in force; but now that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> has begun to be of the spirit among God's faithful servants, the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and contumacious are slain with the sword of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, in that they are cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For they cannot live out of it, since the house of God is one, and there can be no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to any except in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> testifies that the undisciplined perish, because they do not listen to, nor <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> wholesome precepts; for it says, <q>An undisciplined man loves not him that corrects him. But they who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> reproof shall be consumed with disgrace.</q> </p>

<p>5. Therefore, dearest brother, endeavour that the undisciplined should not be consumed and perish, that as much as you can, by your salutary counsels, you should rule the brotherhood, and take counsel of each one with a view to his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Strait and narrow is the way through which we enter into life, but excellent and great is the reward when we enter into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Let those who have once made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>  please God in all things, and not offend God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> nor the Lord's Church by the scandal of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And if, for the present, certain of our brethren seem to be made sorry by us, let us nevertheless remain in our wholesome persuasion, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that an apostle also has said, <q>Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052617"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse16">Galatians 4:16</a></span> But if they shall <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> us, we have gained our brethren, and have formed them as well to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> as to dignity by our address. But if some of the perverse <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> refuse to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, let us follow the same apostle, who says, <q>If I please men, I should not be the servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052618"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse10">Galatians 1:10</a></span> If we cannot please some, so as to make them please Christ, let us assuredly, as far as we can, please Christ our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by observing His precepts. I bid you, brother beloved and much longed-for. heartily farewell in the Lord. </p>
