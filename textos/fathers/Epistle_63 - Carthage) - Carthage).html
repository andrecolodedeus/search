<h1>Epistle 63</h1>

<p><strong>To Epictetus and to the Congregation of Assurae, Concerning Fortunatianus, Formerly Their Bishop.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; He Warns Epictetus and the Congregation of the Assuritans Not to Allow Fortunatianus, a Lapser, But Their Former Bishop, to Return to His Episcopate, as Well for Other Reasons as Because It Had Been Decreed that Lapsed Bishops Should Not Be Admitted to Their Former Rank.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Epictetus his brother, and to the people established at Assurae, greeting. I was gravely and grievously disturbed, dearest brethren, at learning that Fortunatianus, formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> among you, after the sad lapse of his fall, was now wishing to act as if he were sound, and beginning to claim for himself the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. Which thing distressed me; in the first place, on his own account, who, wretched man that he is, being either wholly blinded in the darkness of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, or deceived by the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> persuasion of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; when he ought to be making atonement, and to give himself to the work of entreating the Lord night and day, by tears, and supplications, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, dares still to claim to himself the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> which he has betrayed, as if it were right, from the altars of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, to approach to the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Or as if he would not provoke a greater <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and indignation of the Lord against himself in the day of judgment, who, not being able to be a guide to the brethren in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, stands forth as a teacher in perfidy, in boldness, and in temerity; and he who has not taught the brethren to stand bravely in the battle, teaches those who are conquered and prostrate not even to ask <em>for pardon</em>; although the Lord says, <q>To them have you poured a drink-offering, and to them have you offered a meat-offering. Shall I not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> for these things? Says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052668"><a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;57:6</a></span> And in another place, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to any god, save unto the Lord only, shall be destroyed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052669"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;22:20</a></span> Moreover, the Lord again speaks, and says, <q>They have worshipped those whom their own fingers have made: and the mean man bows down, and the great man <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself: and I will not forgive them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052670"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;2:8-9</a></span> In the Apocalypse also, we read the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the Lord threatening, and saying, <q>If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God mixed in the cup of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torments shall ascend up for ever and ever; neither shall they have rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052671"><a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse9">Revelation&nbsp;14:9-11</a></span> </p>

<p>2. Since, therefore, the Lord threatens these torments, these punishments in the day of judgment, to those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, how does he think that he can act as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of God who has <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> and served the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; or how does he think that his hand can be transferred to the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the Lord which has been captive to sacrilege and to crime, when in the sacred Scriptures God forbids the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to approach to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> even if they have been in lighter guilt; and says in Leviticus: <q>The man in whom there shall be any blemish or stain shall not approach to offer gifts to God? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052672"><a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse17">Leviticus&nbsp;21:17</a></span> Also in Exodus: <q>And let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> which come near to the Lord God sanctify themselves, lest perchance the Lord forsake them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052673"><a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse22">Exodus&nbsp;19:22</a></span> And again: <q>And when they come near to minister at the altar of the Holy One, they shall not bring <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> upon them, lest they die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052674"><a href="../bible/exo028.htm#verse43">Exodus&nbsp;28:43</a></span> Those, therefore, who have brought grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> upon themselves, that is, who, by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, have offered <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, cannot claim to themselves the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor make any <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for their brethren in His sight; since it is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hears not a sinner; but if any man be a worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and does His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, him He hears.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052675"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;9:31</a></span> Nevertheless the profound gloom of the falling darkness has so blinded the hearts of some, that they receive no light from the wholesome precepts, but, once turned away from the direct path of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way, they are hurried headlong and suddenly by the night and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. </p>

<p>3. Nor is it wonderful if now those reject our counsels, or the Lord's precepts, who have denied the Lord. They desire gifts, and offerings, and gain, for which formerly they watched insatiably. They still long also for suppers and banquets, whose debauch they belched forth in the indigestion lately left to the day, most manifestly proving now that they did not before serve religion, but rather their belly and gain, with profane cupidity. Whence also we perceive and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this rebuke has come from God's searching out, that they might not continue to stand at the altar; and any further, as unchaste <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, to have to do with modesty; as perfidious, to have to do with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; as profane, with religion; as earthly, with things divine; as <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>, with things sacred. That such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may not return again to the profanation of the altar, and to the contagion of the brethren, we must keep watch with all our powers, and strive with all our strength, that, as far as in us lies, we may keep them back from this audacity of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that they attempt not any longer to act in the character of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; who, cast down to the lowest pit of death, have gone headlong with the weight of a greater destruction beyond the lapses of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>.</p>

<p>4. But if, among these insane <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, their incurable <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> shall continue, and, with the withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the blindness which has begun shall remain in its deep night, our counsel will be to separate individual brethren from their deceitfulness; and, lest any one should run into the toils of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, to separate them from their contagion. Since neither can the oblation be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not; nor can the Lord avail to any one by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications of one who himself has done despite to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. But if Fortunatianus, either by the blindness induced by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> forgetful of his crime, or become a minister and servant of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> for deceiving the brotherhood, shall persevere in this his <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, do you, as far as in you lies, strive, and in this darkness of the rage of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, recall the minds of the brethren from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, that they may not easily consent to the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of another; that they may not make themselves partakers in the crimes of abandoned men; but being sound, let them maintain the constant tenor of their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and of the integrity preserved and guarded by them. </p>

<p>5. Let the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, however, who acknowledge the greatness of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not depart from entreating the Lord, nor forsake the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which has been appointed one and alone by the Lord; but, continuing in their atonements and entreating the Lord's mercy, let them knock at the <em>door of the</em> Church, that they may be received there where once they were, and may return to Christ from whom they have departed, and not listen to those who deceive them with a fallacious and deadly seduction; since it is written, <q>Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things comes the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God upon the children of disobedience; be not therefore partakers with them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052678"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse6">Ephesians 5:6-7</a></span> Therefore let no one associate himself with the contumacious, and those who do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and those who entirely with draw from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But if any one should be impatient of entreating the Lord who is offended, and should be unwilling to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> us, but should follow desperate and abandoned men, he must take the blame to himself when the day of judgment shall come. For how shall he be able in that day to entreat the Lord, who has both before this denied Christ, and now also the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sound and wholesome and living, has made himself an associate and a partaker with the dying? I bid you, dearest brethren and longed-for, ever heartily farewell.</p>
