<h1>Epistle 64</h1>

<p><strong>To Rogatianus, Concerning the Deacon Who Contended Against the Bishop.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian Warns the Bishop Rogatianus to Restrain the Pride of the Deacon Who Had Provoked Him with His Insults, and to Compel Him to Repent of His Boldness; Taking Occasion to Repeat Once More Whatever He Has Said in the Previous Letter, About the Sacerdotal or Episcopal Power.</em> </p>

<p>1. Cyprian to his brother Rogatianus, greeting. I and my colleagues who were present with me were deeply and grievously distressed, dearest brother, on reading your letter in which you complained of your <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, that, forgetful of your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> station, and unmindful of his own office and ministry, he had provoked you by his insults and injuries. And you indeed have acted worthily, and with your accustomed humility towards us, in rather complaining of him to us; although you have power, according to the vigour of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> and the authority of your See, whereby you might be justified on him at once, assured that all we your colleagues would regard it as a matter of satisfaction, whatever you should do by your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power in respect of an insolent <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, as you have in respect of men of this kind divine commands. Inasmuch as the Lord God says in Deuteronomy, <q>And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or the judge, whoever he shall be in those days, that man shall die; and all the people, when they hear, shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and shall no more do impiously.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052681"><a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy&nbsp;17:12-13</a></span> And that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this voice of God came forth with His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and highest majesty to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and avenge His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; when three of the ministers  &mdash; Korah, Dathan, and Abiram&mdash; dared to deal proudly, and to exalt their neck against <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and to equal themselves with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> set over them; they were swallowed up and devoured by the opening of the earth, and so immediately suffered the penalty of their <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> audacity. Nor they alone, but also two hundred and fifty others, who were their companions in boldness, were consumed by a fire breaking forth from the Lord, that it might be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are avenged by Him who makes <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In the book of Kings also, when Samuel the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was despised by the Jewish people on account of his age, as you are now, the Lord in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> exclaimed, and said, <q>They have not rejected you, but they have rejected me.</q>  And that He might avenge this, He set over them Saul as a king, who afflicted them with grievous injuries, and trod on the people, and pressed down their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> with all insults and penalties, that the despised <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> might he avenged by divine vengeance on a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> people.</p>

<p>2. Moreover also Solomon, established in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, testifies and teaches what is the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> authority and power, saying, <q>Fear the Lord with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and reverence His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052684"><a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse29">Sirach&nbsp;7:29</a></span> and again, <q>Honour God with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052685"><a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse31">Sirach&nbsp;7:31</a></span> Mindful of which precepts, the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, according to what we read in the Acts of the Apostles, when it was said to him, <q>Do you revile thus God's <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>? </q>answered and said, <q>I knew not, brethren, that he was the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>; for it is written, You shall not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the ruler of your people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052686"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;23:4-5</a></span> Moreover, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself, our King, and Judge, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even to the very day, of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> observed the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a>, although they observed neither the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God nor the acknowledgment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For when He had cleansed the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, He said to him, <q>Go, show yourself to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and offer the gift.</q>  With that humility which taught us also to he <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, He still called him a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>; also under the very sting of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, when He had received a blow, and it was said to Him, <q>Do you answer the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> so? </q>He said nothing reproachfully against the person of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, but rather maintained His own innocence saying, <q>If I have spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but if well, why do you smite me? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052688"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse23">John 18:23</a></span> All which things were therefore done by Him humbly and patiently, that we might have an example of humility and patience; for He taught that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were lawfully and fully to be honoured, in showing Himself such as He was in respect of false <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</p>

<p>3. But <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> ought to remember that the Lord chose <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that is, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and overseers; while <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> appointed for themselves <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>  after the ascent of the Lord into heaven, as ministers of their episcopacy and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But if we may dare anything against God who makes <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> may also dare against us by whom they are made; and therefore it behooves the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of whom you write to repent of his audacity, and to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> set over him with full humility. For these things are the beginnings of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and the origins and endeavours of evil-minded schismatics;&mdash; to please themselves, and with swelling haughtiness to despise him who is set over them. Thus they depart from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash; thus a profane altar is set up outside&mdash; thus they rebel against the peace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the appointment and the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if, further, he shall harass and provoke you with his insults, you must exercise against him the power of your dignity, by either deposing him or excommunicating him. For if the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, writing to Timothy, said, <q>Let no man despise your youth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052690"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse12">1 Timothy 4:12</a></span> how much rather must it he said by your colleagues to you, Let no man despise your age? And since you have written, that one has associated himself with that same <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of yours, and is a partaker of his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and boldness, you may either restrain or excommunicate him also, and any others that may appear of a like disposition, and act against God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Unless, as we exhort and advise, they should rather perceive that they have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and make satisfaction, and suffer us to keep our own purpose; for we rather ask and desire to overcome the reproaches and injuries of individuals by clemency and patience, than to punish them by our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power.  I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>
