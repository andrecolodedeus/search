<h1>Epistle 65</h1>

<p><strong>To the Clergy and People Abiding at Furni, About Victor, Who Had Made the Presbyter Faustinus a Guardian.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Since, Against the Decision of a Council of Bishops, Geminius Victor Had Named in His Will Geminius Faustinus the Presbyter as His Guardian or Curator, He Forbids that Offering Should Be Made for Him, or that the Sacrifice Should Be Celebrated for His Repose, Inferring by the Way, from the Example of the Levitical Tribe, that Clerics Ought Not to MIX Themselves Up in Secular Cares.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and people abiding at Furni, greeting. I and my colleagues who were present with me were greatly disturbed, dearest brethren, as were also our fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who sate with us, when we were made aware that Geminius Victor, our brother, when departing this life, had named Geminius Faustinus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> executor to his will, although long since it was decreed, in a council of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, that no one should appoint any of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the ministers of God executor or guardian  by his will, since every one honoured by the divine <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and ordained in the clerical service, ought to serve only the altar and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and to have leisure for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications. For it is written: <q>No man that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> for God entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please Him to whom he has pledged himself.</q>  As this is said of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, how much rather ought those not to be bound by worldly anxieties and involvements, who, being busied with divine and spiritual things, are not able to withdraw from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to have leisure for earthly and secular doings! The form of which ordination and engagement the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> formerly observed under the law, so that when the eleven tribes divided the land and shared the possessions, the Levitical tribe, which was left free for the temple and the altar, and for the divine ministries, received nothing from that portion of the division; but while others cultivated the soil, that portion only cultivated the favour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and received the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> from the eleven tribes, for their food and maintenance, from the fruits which grew. All which was done by divine authority and arrangement, so that they who waited on divine services might in no respect be called away, nor be compelled to consider or to transact secular business. Which plan and rule is now maintained in respect of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, that they who are promoted by clerical ordination in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord may be called off in no respect from the divine administration, nor be tied down by worldly anxieties and matters; but in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the brethren who contribute, receiving as it were tenths of the fruits, they may not withdraw from the altars and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, but may serve day and might in heavenly and spiritual things.</p>

<p>2. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> our predecessors religiously considering this, and wholesomely providing for it, decided that no brother departing should name a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> for executor or guardian; and if any one should do this, no offering should be made for him, nor any <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> be celebrated for his repose.  For he does not deserve to be named at the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who has wished to call away the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and ministers from the altar. And therefore, since Victor, contrary to the rule lately made in council by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, has dared to appoint Geminius Faustinus, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, his executor, it is not allowed that any offering be made by you for his repose, nor any <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be made in the church in his name, that so the decree of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, religiously and needfully made, may be kept by us; and, at the same time, an example be given to the rest of the brethren, that no one should call away to secular anxieties the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and ministers of God who are occupied with the service of His altar and Church. For care will probably be taken in time to come that this happen not with respect to the person of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> any more, if what has now been done has been punished. I bid you, dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell.</p>
