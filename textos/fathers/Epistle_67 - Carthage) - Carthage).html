<h1>Epistle 67</h1>

<p><strong>To the Clergy and People Abiding in Spain, Concerning Basilides and Martial.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and Martial, Bishops, Having Lapsed and Become Contaminated by the Certificates of Idolatry, Cyprian with His Fellow-Bishops Praises the Clergy and People of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> that They Had Substituted in Their Place by a Legitimate Election, Sabinus and Felix; Especially As, According to the Decision of Cornelius and His Colleagues, Lapsed Bishops Might Indeed Be Received to Repentance, But Were Prohibited from the Priestly Honour. Moreover, He Alludes by the Way to Certain Matters About the Ancient Rite of Episcopal Election. The Context Indicates that This Was Written During the Episcopate of Stephen.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian, Caecilius, Primus, Polycarp, Nicomedes, Lucilianus, Successus, Sedatus, Fortunatus, Januarius, Secundinus, Pomponius, Honoratus, Victor, Aurelius, Sattius, Petrus, another Januarius, Saturninus, another Aurelius, Venantius, Quietus, Rogatianus, Tenax, Felix, Faustinus, Quintus, another Saturninus, Lucius, Vincentius, Libosus, Geminius, Marcellus, Iambus, Adelphius, Victoricus, and Paulus, to Felix the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and to the peoples abiding at Legio  and Asturica,  also to Laelius the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and the people abiding at Emerita,  brethren in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, greeting. When we had come together, dearly beloved brethren, we read your letters, which according to the integrity of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and your <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God you wrote to us by Felix and Sabinus our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, signifying that <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and Martial, being stained with the certificates of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and bound with the consciousness of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> crimes, ought not to hold the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> and administer the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and you desired an answer to be written to you again concerning these things, and your solicitude, no less just than needful, to be relieved either by the comfort or by the help of our judgment. Nevertheless to this your desire not so much our counsels as the divine precepts reply, in which it is long since bidden by the voice of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and prescribed by the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who and what sort of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> ought to serve the altar and to celebrate the divine <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. For in Exodus God speaks to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and warns him, saying, <q>Let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> which come near to the Lord God sanctify themselves, lest the Lord forsake them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052712"><a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse22">Exodus&nbsp;19:22</a></span> And again: <q>And when they come near to the altar of the Holy One to minister they shall not bring <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> upon them, lest they die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052713"><a href="../bible/exo028.htm#verse43">Exodus&nbsp;28:43</a></span> Also in Leviticus the Lord commands and says, <q>Whosoever has any spot or blemish upon him, shall not approach to offer gifts to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052714"><a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse17">Leviticus&nbsp;21:17</a></span> </p>

<p>2. Since these things are announced and are made plain to us, it is necessary that our <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> should wait upon the divine precepts; nor in matters of this kind can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> indulgence accept any man's person, or yield anything to any one, when the divine prescription has interfered, and establishes a law. For we ought not to be forgetful what the Lord spoke to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, rebuking, and indignant that they had despised the divine precepts and followed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> doctrines. <q>This people,</q> he says, honours me with their lips, but their heart is widely removed from me; but in vain do they worship me, teaching the doctrines and commandments of men. <span class="stiki" id="note052715"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13</a></span> This also the Lord repeats in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and says, <q>You reject the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may establish your own tradition.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052716"><a href="../bible/mar007.htm#verse13">Mark&nbsp;7:13</a></span> Having which things before our eyes, and solicitously and religiously considering them, we ought in the ordinations of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to choose none but unstained and upright ministers,  who, holily and worthily offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may be heard in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which they make for the safety of the Lord's people, since it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hears not a sinner; but if any man be a worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and does His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, him He hears.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052718"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse31">John 9:31</a></span> On which account it is fitting, that with full diligence and sincere investigation those should be chosen for God's <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> whom it is manifest God will hear.</p>

<p>3. Nor let the people flatter themselves that they can be free from the contagion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while communicating with a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who is a sinner, and yielding their consent to the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and unlawful episcopacy of their overseer, when the divine reproof by Hosea the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> threatens, and says, <q>Their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> shall be as the bread of mourning; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052719"><a href="../bible/hos009.htm#verse4">Hosea 9:4</a></span> teaching manifestly and showing that all are absolutely bound to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> who have been contaminated by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of a profane and unrighteous <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Which, moreover, we find to be manifested also in Numbers, when Korah, and Dathan, and Abiram Claimed for themselves the power of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> in opposition to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. There also the Lord commanded by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that the people should be separated from them, lest, being associated with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, themselves also should be bound closely in the same <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. <q>Separate yourselves,</q> said He, <q>from the tents of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and hardened men, and touch not those things which belong to them, lest you perish together in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052720"><a href="../bible/num016.htm#verse26">Numbers 16:26</a></span> On which account a people <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the Lord's precepts, and fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ought to separate themselves from a sinful prelate, and not to associate themselves with the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, especially since they themselves have the power either of choosing worthy <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or of rejecting unworthy ones.</p>

<p>4. Which very thing, too, we observe to come from divine authority, that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should be chosen in the presence of the people under the eyes of all, and should be approved worthy and suitable by public judgment and testimony; as in the book of Numbers the Lord commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying, <q>Take <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> your brother, and Eleazar his son, and place them in the mount, in the presence of all the assembly, and strip <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and let <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> die there, and be added to his people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052721"><a href="../bible/num020.htm#verse25">Numbers 20:25-26</a></span> God commands a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to be appointed in the presence of all the assembly; that is, He instructs and shows that the ordination of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> ought not to be solemnized except with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the people standing near, that in the presence of the people either the crimes of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> may be disclosed, or the merits of the good may be declared, and the ordination, which shall have been examined by the suffrage and judgment of all, may be just and legitimate.  And this is subsequently observed, according to divine instruction, in the Acts of the Apostles, when Peter speaks to the people of ordaining an apostle in the place of Judas. <q>Peter,</q> it says, <q>stood up in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and the multitude were in one place.</q>  Neither do we observe that this was regarded by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> only in the ordinations of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but also in those of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, of which matter itself also it is written in their Acts: <q>And they twelve called together,</q> it says, <q>the whole congregation of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and said to them; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052724"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse2">Acts 4:2</a></span> which was done so diligently and carefully, with the calling together of the whole of the people, surely for this reason, that no unworthy person might creep into the ministry of the altar, or to the office of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. For that unworthy <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are sometimes ordained, not according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> presumption, and that those things which do not come of a legitimate and righteous ordination are displeasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself manifests by Hosea the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, <q>They have set up for themselves a king, but not by me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052725"><a href="../bible/hos008.htm#verse4">Hosea 8:4</a></span></p>

<p>5. For which reason you must diligently observe and keep the practice delivered from divine tradition and apostolic observance, which is also maintained among us, and almost throughout all the provinces;  that for the proper celebration of ordinations all the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the same province should assemble with that people for which a prelate is ordained. And the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be chosen in the presence of the people, who have most fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the life of each one, and have looked into the doings of each one as respects his habitual conduct. And this also, we see, was done by you in the ordination of our colleague Sabinus; so that, by the suffrage of the whole brotherhood,  and by the sentence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had assembled in their presence, and who had written letters to you concerning him, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> was conferred upon him, and hands were imposed on him in the place of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>. Neither can it rescind an ordination rightly perfected, that <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, after the detection of his crimes, and the baring of his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> even by his own confession, went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and deceived Stephen our colleague, placed at a distance, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what had been done, and of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to canvass that he might be replaced <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> from which he had been righteously deposed.  The result of this is, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> are not so much abolished as enhanced, inasmuch as to his former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he has also added the crime of deceit and circumvention. For he is not so much to be blamed who has been through heedlessness surprised by fraud, as he is to be execrated who has fraudulently taken him by surprise. But if <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> could deceive men, he cannot deceive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not mocked.</q>  But neither can deceit advantage Martialis, in such a way as that he who also is involved in great crimes should hold his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>, since the apostle also warns, and says, <q>A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be blameless, as the steward of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052730"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse7">Titus 1:7</a></span></p>

<p>6. Wherefore, since as you have written, dearly beloved brethren, and as Felix and Sabinus our colleagues affirm, and as another Felix of Caesar Augusta,  a maintainer of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and a defender of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, signifies in his letter, <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and Martialis have been contaminated by the abominable certificate of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; and <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, moreover, besides the stain of the certificate, when he was prostrate in sickness, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and confessed that he <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>; and because of the wound to his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, voluntarily laying down his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, turned himself to repentance, entreating <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and considering himself sufficiently <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> if it might be permitted him to communicate even as a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>: Martialis also, besides the long frequenting of the disgraceful and filthy banquets of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in their college, and placing his sons in the same college, after the manner of foreign nations, among profane sepulchres, and burying them together with strangers, has also affirmed, by acts which are publicly taken before a ducenarian <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>,  that he had yielded himself to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and had denied Christ; and as there are many other and grave crimes in which <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and Martialis are held to be implicated; such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> attempt to claim for themselves the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> in vain; since it is evident that men of that kind may neither rule over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor ought to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, especially since Cornelius also, our colleague, a peaceable and righteous <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and moreover honoured by the condescension of the Lord with <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, has long ago decreed with us,  and with all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appointed throughout the whole world, that men of, this sort might indeed be admitted to repentance, but were prohibited from the ordination of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<p>7. Nor let it disturb you, dearest brethren, if with some, in these last times, either an uncertain <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is wavering, or a <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God without religion is vacillating, or a peaceable concord does not continue. These things have been foretold as about to happen in the end of the world; and it was predicted by the voice of the Lord, and by the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that now that the world is failing, and the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> is drawing near, everything good shall fail, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and adverse things shall prosper. </p>

<p>8. Yet although, in these last times, evangelic rigour has not so failed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, nor the strength of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> so languished, that there is not left a portion of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> which in no respect gives way under these ruins of things and wrecks of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but, bold and steadfast, they maintain the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the divine majesty and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity, with full observance of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. We remember and keep in view that, although others succumbed and yielded, Mattathias boldly vindicated God's law; that Elias, when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> gave way and departed from the divine religion, stood and nobly contended; that Daniel, deterred neither by the loneliness of a foreign country nor by the harassment of continual <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, frequently and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>; also that the three youths, subdued neither by their tender years  nor by threats, stood up faithfully against the Babylonian fires, and conquered the victor king even in their very captivity itself. Let the number either of prevaricators or of traitors see to it, who have now begun to rise in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to corrupt as well the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Among very many there still remains a sincere mind and a substantial religion, and a spirit devoted to nothing but the Lord and its God.  Nor does the perfidy of others press down the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> into ruin, but rather stimulates and exalts it to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to what the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> exhorts, and says: <q>For what if some of these have fallen from their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: has their unbelief made the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of God of none effect? God forbid. For God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but every man a liar.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052737"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse3">Romans 3:3-4</a></span> But if every man is a liar,and God only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, what else ought we, the servants, and especially the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to do, than forsake <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and lies, and continue in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, keeping the Lord's precepts?</p>

<p>9. Wherefore, although there have been found: some among our colleagues, dearest brethren, who think that the godly discipline may be neglected, and who rashly hold communion with <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and Martialis, such a thing as this ought not to trouble our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> threatens such in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, saying, <q>But you hate instruction, and cast my words behind you: when you saw a thief, you consented unto him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.</q>  He shows that they become sharers and partakers of other men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> who are associated with the delinquents. And besides, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle writes, and says the same thing: <q>Whisperers, backbiters, haters of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, injurious, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, boasters of themselves, inventors of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, who, although they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, did not understand that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only they which commit those things, but they also which consent unto those who do these things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052739"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse30">Romans 1:30-32</a></span> Since they, says he, who do such things are worthy of death, he makes manifest and proves that not only they are worthy of death, and come into punishment who do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, but also those who consent unto those who do such things&mdash; who, while they are mingled in unlawful communion with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and sinners, and the unrepenting, are polluted by the contact of the guilty, and, being joined in the fault, are thus not separated in its penalty. For which reason we not only approve, but applaud, dearly beloved brethren, the religious solicitude of your integrity and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and exhort you as much as we can by our letters, not to mingle in <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> communion with profane and polluted <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but maintain the sound and sincere constancy of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with religious <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. I bid you, dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell.</p>
