<h1>Epistle 68</h1>

<p><strong>To Florentius Pupianus, on Calumniators.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian Clears Himself in the Eyes of Florentius Pupianus from Various Crimes of Which He is Accused by Him; And Argues the Lightness of His Mind, in that He Has So Hastily Trusted Calumniators.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian, who is also called Thascius,  to Florentius, who is also Pupianus, his brother, greeting. I had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, brother, that you were now at length turned to repentance for having either rashly heard or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in time past things so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, so disgraceful, so execrable even among <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, concerning me. But even now in your letter I perceive that you are still the same as you were before&mdash; that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the same things concerning me, and that you persist in what you did <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and, lest by chance the dignity of your eminence and your <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> should be stained by communion with me, that you are inquiring carefully into my character; and after God the Judge who makes <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that you wish to judge&mdash; I will not say of me, for what am I?&mdash; but of the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This is not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God&mdash; this is to stand forth as a rebel against Christ and His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; so that although He says, <q>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And neither of them falls to the ground without the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my Father,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052742"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;10:29</a></span> and His majesty and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> prove that even things of little consequence are not done without the consciousness and permission of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you think that God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are ordained in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they who are ordained are unworthy and unchaste, what else is it than to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are not appointed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor through God?</p>

<p>2. Think you that my testimony of myself is better than that of God? When the Lord Himself teaches, and says that testimony is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, if any one himself appears as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> concerning himself, for the reason that every one would assuredly favour himself. Nor would any one put forward mischievous and adverse things against himself, but there may be a simple confidence of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> if, in what was announced of us, another is the announcer and <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. <q>If,</q> He says, <q>I bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of myself, my testimony is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but there is another who bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052743"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;5:31-32</a></span> but if the Lord Himself, who will by and by judge all things, was unwilling to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on His own testimony, but preferred to be approved by the judgment and testimony of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, how much more does it be-hove His servants to observe this, who are not only approved by, but even <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the judgment and testimony of God! But with you the fabrication of hostile and malignant men has prevailed against the divine decree, and against our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> resting upon the strength of its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as if among lapsed and profane <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> placed outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, from whose breasts the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has departed, there could be anything else than a depraved mind and a deceitful tongue, and venomous <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> lies, which whosoever believes, must of necessity be found with them when the day of judgment shall come.</p>

<p>3. But with respect to what you have said, that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should be lowly, because both the Lord and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were lowly; both all the brethren and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> my humility; and you also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and loved it while you were still in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and were in communion with me. But which of us is far from humility: I, who daily serve the brethren, and kindly receive with good-will and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> every one that comes to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; or you, who appoint yourself <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and judge of a judge,  given for the time by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? Although the Lord God says in Deuteronomy, <q>And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or unto the judge who shall be in those days, even that man shall die; and all the people, when they hear, shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and do no more presumptuously.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052745"><a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy&nbsp;17:12-13</a></span> And again He speaks to Samuel, and says, <q>They have not despised you, but they have despised me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052746"><a href="../bible/1sa008.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;8:7</a></span> And moreover the Lord, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, when it was said to Him, <q>Do you answer the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> so? </q>guarding the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity, and teaching that it ought to be maintained, would say nothing against the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, but only clearing His own innocence, answered, saying, <q>If I have spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but if well, why do you smite me? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052747"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;18:23</a></span> The blessed apostle also, when it was said to him, <q>Do you revile God's <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>? </q>spoke nothing reproachfully against the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, when he might have lifted up himself boldly against those who had crucified the Lord, and who had already <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> God and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the temple and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; but even although in false and degraded <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, considering still the mere empty shadow of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> name, he said, <q>I knew not, brethren, that he was the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>; for it is written, You shall not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the ruler of your people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052748"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;23:4-5</a></span> </p>

<p>4. Unless perchance I was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to you before the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, when you held communion with me, and ceased to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> after the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>! For the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, when it came, lifted you to the highest sublimity of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. But it depressed me with the burden of proscription, since it was publicly declared, <q>If any one holds or possesses any of the property of Caecilius Cyprian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; </q>so that even they who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God appointing a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, could still <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> proscribing a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Nor do I boast of these things, but with grief I bring them forward, since you constitute yourself a judge  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who says to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and thereby to all chief rulers, who by vicarious ordination succeed to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: <q>He that hears you, hears me; and he that hears me, hears Him that sent me; and he that despises you, despises me, and Him that sent me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052750"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse16">Luke 10:16</a></span></p>

<p>5. For from this have arisen, and still arise, schisms and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, in that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who is one  and rules over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is contemned by the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> presumption of some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and the man who is honoured by God's condescension, is judged unworthy by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For what swelling of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is this, what arrogance of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, what inflation of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to call prelates and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to one's own recognition, and unless I may be declared clear in your sight and absolved by your judgment, behold now for six years the brotherhood has neither had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, nor the people a prelate,  nor the flock a pastor, nor the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a governor, nor Christ a representative,  nor God a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>! Pupianus must come to the rescue, and give judgment, and declare the decision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Christ accepted, that so great a number of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who have been summoned away, under my rule, may not appear to have departed without hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and of peace; that the new crowd of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> may not be considered to have failed of attaining any <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by my ministry;  that the peace conferred upon so many lapsed and penitent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and the communion vouchsafed by my examination, may not be abrogated by the authority of your judgment. Condescend for once, and deign to pronounce concerning us, and to establish our <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> by the authority of your recognition, that God and His Christ may thank you, in that by your means a representative and ruler has been restored as well to their altar as to their people.</p>

<p>6. Bees have a king, and cattle a leader, and <em>they</em> keep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to him. Robbers <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> their chief with an <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> full of humility. How much more simple and better than you are the brute cattle and dumb animals, and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, although bloody, and raging among swords and weapons! The chief among them is acknowledged and feared, whom no divine judgment has appointed, but on whom an abandoned faction and a guilty band have agreed.</p>

<p>7. You say, indeed, that the scruple into which you have fallen ought to be taken from your mind. You have fallen into it, but it was by your irreligious credulity. You have fallen into it, but it was by your own <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> disposition and will in easily hearkening to unchaste, to impious, to unspeakable things against your brother. against a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and in willingly believing them in defending other men's falsehoods, as if they were your own and your private property; and in not remembering that it is written, <q>Hedge your ears with thorns, and hearken not to a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> tongue; </q>  and again: <q>A <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> doer gives heed to the tongue of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>; but a righteous man regards not lying lips.</q>  Wherefore have not the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> fallen into this scruple, full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and already by their passion near to the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of His Christ; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who, from their dungeon, directed letters to Cyprian the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, acknowledging the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to him? Wherefore have not so many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, my colleagues, fallen into this scruple, who either, when they departed from the midst of us, were proscribed, or being taken were cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and were in chains; or who, sent away into exile, have gone by an illustrious road to the Lord; or who in some places, condemned to death, have received heavenly crowns from the glorification of the Lord? Wherefore have not they fallen into this scruple, from among that people of ours which is with us, and is by God's condescension committed to us&mdash; so many confessors who have been put to the question and tortured, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> by the memory of illustrious wounds and scars; so many chaste <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, so many praiseworthy <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>; finally, all the churches throughout the whole world who are associated with us in the bond of unity? Unless all these, who are in communion with me, as you have written, are polluted with the pollution of my lips, and have lost the hope of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life by the contagion of my communion.  Pupianus alone, sound, inviolate, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, modest, who would not associate himself with us, shall dwell alone in paradise and in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</p>

<p>8. You have written also, that on my account the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has now a portion of herself in a state of dispersion, although the whole people of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are collected, and united, and joined to itself in an undivided concord: they alone have remained without, who even, if they had been within, would have had to be cast out. Nor does the Lord, the protector of His people, and their guardian, suffer the wheat to be snatched from His floor; but the chaff alone can be separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since also the apostle says, <q>For what if some of them have departed from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Shall their unbelief make the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of God of none effect? God forbid; for God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but every man a liar.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052758"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse3">Romans 3:3-4</a></span> And the Lord also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, when <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> forsook Him as He spoke, turning to the twelve, said, <q>Will you also go away? </q>then Peter answered Him, <q>Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the word of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and are sure, that You are the Son of the living God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052759"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse67">John 6:67-69</a></span> Peter speaks there, on whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was to be built,  teaching and showing in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that although a rebellious and arrogant multitude of those who will not hear and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> may depart, yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not depart from Christ; and they are the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who are a people united to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the flock which adheres to its pastor.  Whence you ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>;  and if any one be not with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that he is not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that those flatter themselves in vain who creep in, not having peace with God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and think that they communicate secretly with some; while the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and one, is not cut nor divided, but is indeed connected and bound together by the cement of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who cohere with one another.</p>

<p>9. Wherefore, brother, if you consider God's majesty who ordains <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, if you will for once have respect to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who by His decree and word, and by His presence, both rules prelates themselves, and rules the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by prelates; if you will trust, in respect of the innocence of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, but the divine judgment; if you will begin even a late repentance for your temerity, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and insolence; if you will most abundantly make satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His Christ whom I serve, and to whom with pure and unstained lips I ceaselessly offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, not only in peace, but in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; we may have some ground for communion with you, even although there still remain among us respect and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for the divine censure; so that first I should consult my Lord whether He would permit peace to be granted to you, and you to be received to the communion of His Church by His own showing and admonition.</p>

<p>10. For I remember what has already been manifested to me, nay, what has been prescribed by the authority of our Lord and God to an <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> and fearing servant; and among other things which He condescended to show and to reveal, He also added this: <q>Whoever therefore does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who makes the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, shall hereafter begin to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him who avenges the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</q> Although I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that to some men dreams seem ridiculous and visions foolish, yet assuredly it is to such as would rather <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, than <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But it is no wonder, since his brethren said of Joseph, <q>Behold, this dreamer comes; come now therefore, let us slay him.</q>  And afterwards the dreamer attained to what he had dreamed; and his slayers and sellers were put to confusion, so that they, who at first did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the words, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. But of those things that you have done, either in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> or in peace, it is foolish for me to pretend to judge you, since you rather appoint yourself a judge over us. These things, of the pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and of my confidence in my Lord and my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I have written at length. You have my letter, and I yours. In the day of judgment, before the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, both will be read.</p>
