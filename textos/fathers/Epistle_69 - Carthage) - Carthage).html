<h1>Epistle 69</h1>

<p><strong>To Januarius and Other Numidian Bishops, on Baptizing Heretics.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; The Argument of This Letter and the Next is Found in a Subsequent Epistle to Stephen;</em>  <em><q>That What Heretics Use is Not Baptism; And that None Among Them Can Receive Benefit by the Grace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who Oppose Christ; Has Been Lately Carefully Expressed in a Letter Which Was Written on that Subject to Quintus, Our Colleague, Established in Mauritania; As Also in a Letter Which Our Colleagues Previously Wrote to the Bishops Presiding in Numidia; Of Both of Which Letters I Have Subjoined Copies.</q></em> </p>

<p>1. Cyprian, Liberalis, Caldonius, Junius, Primus, Caecilius, Polycarp, Nicomedes, Felix, Marrutius, Successus, Lucianus, Honoratus, Fortunatus, Victor, Donatus, Lucius, Herculanus, Pomponius, Demetrius, Quintus, Saturninus Januarius, Marcus, another Saturninus, another Donatus, Rogatianus, Sedatus, Tertullus, Hortensianus, still another Saturninus, Sattius, to their brethren Januarius, Saturninus, Maximus, Victor, another Victor, Cassius, Proculus, Modianus, Cittinus, Gargilius, Eutycianus, another Gargilius, another Saturninus, Nemesianus, Nampulus, Antonianus, Rogatianus, Honoratus, greeting. When we were together in council, dearest brethren, we read your letter which you wrote to us concerning those who seem to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, (asking) whether, when the), come to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is one,  they ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. On which matter, although you yourselves hold thereupon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and certainty of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rule, yet since you have thought that of our mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we ought to be consulted, we put forward our opinion, not as a new one,  but we join with you in equal agreement, in an opinion long since decreed by our predecessors, and observed by us&mdash;judging, namely, and holding it for certain that no one can be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> abroad outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> appointed in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church. And it is written in the words of the Lord, <q>They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out broken cisterns, which can hold no water.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052769"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse13">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:13</a></span> And again, sacred Scripture warns, and says, <q>Keep you from the strange water, and drink not from a fountain of strange water.</q>  It is required, then, that the water should first be cleansed and sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>,  that it may wash away by its <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the man who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; because the Lord says by Ezekiel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be cleansed from all your filthiness; and from all your <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> will I cleanse you: a new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052772"><a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse25">Ezekiel&nbsp;36:25-26</a></span> But how can he cleanse and sanctify the water who is himself unclean, and in whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not? Since the Lord says in the book of Numbers, <q>And whatsoever the unclean person touches shall be unclean.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052773"><a href="../bible/num019.htm#verse2">Numbers 19:2</a></span> Or how can he who baptizes give to another remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> who himself, being outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, cannot put away his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?</p>

<p>2. But, moreover, the very interrogation which is put in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For when we say, <q>Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church? </q>we mean that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is not granted except in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, where there is no Church, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> cannot be put away. Therefore they who assert that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, must either change the interrogation or maintain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; unless indeed they attribute a church also to those who, they contend, have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. It is also necessary that he should be anointed who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; so that, having received the chrism,  that is, the anointing, he may be anointed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have in him the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Further, it is the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> whence the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are anointed with the oil sanctified on the altar.  But he cannot sanctify the creature of oil,  who has neither an altar nor a church; whence also there can be no spiritual anointing among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, since it is manifest that the oil cannot be sanctified nor the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> celebrated at all among them. But we ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and remember that it is written, <q>Let not the oil of a sinner anoint my head,</q>  which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> before forewarned in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, lest any one going out of the way and wandering from the path of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should be anointed by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and adversaries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Besides, what <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> can a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who is impious and a sinner offer for a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> person? Since it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hears not a sinner; but if any man be a worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and does His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, him He hears.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052778"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse31">John 9:31</a></span> Who, moreover, can give what he himself has not? Or how can he discharge spiritual functions who himself has lost the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? And therefore he must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and renewed who comes untrained to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that he may be sanctified within by those who are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, since it is written, <q>Be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, for I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052779"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse2">Leviticus 19:2</a></span> So that he who has been seduced into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>  outside <em>of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a></em>, should lay aside even this very thing in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, viz., that he a man coming to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while he seeks for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, fell by the deceit of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> upon a profane one.</p>

<p>3. But it is to approve the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, to admit that they have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For therein a part cannot be void, and part be valid. If one could <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, he could also give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But if he cannot give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because he that is appointed without is not endowed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, he cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those who come; since both <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is one and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is one, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded by Christ the Lord upon Peter, by a source and principle of unity,  is one also. Hence it results, that since with them all things are futile and false, nothing of that which they have done ought to be approved by us. For what can be ratified and established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which is done by them whom the Lord calls His enemies and adversaries? Setting forth in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathers not with me, scatters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052782"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse23">Luke 11:23</a></span> And the blessed Apostle John also, keeping the commandments and precepts of the Lord, has laid it down in his epistle, and said, <q>You have heard that antichrist shall come: even now there are many Antichrists; whereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they would have continued with us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052783"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse18">1 John 2:18-19</a></span> Whence we also ought to gather and consider whether they who are the Lord's adversaries, and are called antichrists, can give the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore we who are with the Lord, and maintain the unity of the Lord, and according to His condescension administer His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, ought to repudiate and reject and regard as profane whatever His adversaries and the antichrists do; and to those who, coming out of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the one Church, we should give the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> both of unity and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by means of all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>.  We bid you, dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell.</p>
