<h1>Epistle 70</h1>

<p><strong>To Quintus, Concerning the Baptism of Heretics.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; An Answer is Given to Quintus a Bishop in Mauritania, Who Has Asked Advice Concerning the Baptism of Heretics.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Quintus his brother, greeting. Lucian, our co-presbyter, has reported to me, dearest brother, that you have wished me to declare to you what I think concerning those who seem to have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics; of which matter, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what several of us fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with the brother <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who were present, lately determined in council, I have sent you a copy of the same epistle. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not by what presumption some of our colleagues  are led to think that they who have been dipped by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> ought not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> when they come to us, for the reason that they say that there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which indeed is therefore one, because the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is one, and there cannot be any <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  For since there cannot be two baptisms, if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, they themselves have this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And he who of his own authority grants this advantage to them yields and consents to them, that the enemy and adversary of Christ should seem to have the power of washing, and purifying, and sanctifying a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But we say that those who come thence are not re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among us, but are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For indeed they do not receive anything there, where there is nothing; but they come to us, that here they may receive where there is both <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because both <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are one. But again some of our colleagues  would rather give <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> than agree with us; and while by the assertion of one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> they are unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those that come, they thus either themselves make two baptisms in saying that there is a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; or certainly, which is a matter of more importance, they strive to set before and prefer the sordid and profane washing of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and only and legitimate <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not considering that it is written, <q>He who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by one dead, what avails his washing? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052789"><a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse25">Sirach&nbsp;34:25</a></span> Now it is manifest that they who are not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are reckoned among the dead; and another cannot be made alive by him who himself is not alive, since there is one Church which, having attained the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, both lives for ever and quickens the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. And they say that in this matter they follow ancient custom;  although among the ancients these were as yet the first beginnings of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and schisms, so that those were involved in them who departed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, having first been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> therein; and these, therefore, when they returned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and repented, it was not necessary to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Which also we observe in the present day, that it is sufficient to lay hands for repentance upon those who are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and have gone over from us to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, if, subsequently acknowledging their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and putting away their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, they return to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and to their parent; so that, because it had been a sheep, the Shepherd may receive into His fold the estranged and vagrant sheep. But if he who comes from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> has not previously been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but comes as a stranger and entirely profane, he must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that he may become a sheep, because in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church is the one water which makes sheep. And therefore, because there can be nothing common to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to darkness and light, to death and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, to <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we ought by all means to maintain the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and not to give way to the enemies of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in any respect.</p>

<p>3. Neither must we prescribe this from custom, but overcome <em>opposite custom</em> by reason. For neither did Peter, whom first the Lord chose, and upon whom He built His Church, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> disputed with him afterwards about <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, claim anything to himself insolently, nor arrogantly assume anything; so as to say that he held the primacy,  and that he ought rather to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> by novices and those lately come.  Nor did he despise <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> because he had previously been a persecutor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but admitted the counsel of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and easily yielded to the lawful reason which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> asserted, furnishing thus an illustration to us both of concord and of patience, that we should not obstinately <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our own opinions, but should rather adopt as our own those which at any time are usefully and wholesomely suggested by our brethren and colleagues, if they be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and lawful. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, moreover, looking forward to this, and consulting faithfully for concord and peace, has laid down in his epistle this rule: <q>Moreover, let the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> speak two or three, and let the rest judge. But if anything be revealed to another that sits by, let the first hold his peace.</q>  In which place he has taught and shown that many things are revealed to individuals for the better, and that each one ought not obstinately to contend for that which he had once imbibed and held; but if anything has appeared better and more useful, he should gladly embrace it. For we are not overcome when better things are presented to us, but we are instructed, especially in those matters which pertain to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; so that we, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and prelates of His Church, by His condescension, should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> cannot be given save in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, nor can the adversaries of Christ claim to themselves anything belonging to His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>4. Which thing, indeed, <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a> also, a man of worthy memory, with his other fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who at that time governed the Lord's Church in the province of Africa and Numidia, decreed, and by the well-weighed examination of the common council established: whose opinion, as being both religious and lawful and salutary, and in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and Church, we also have followed.  And that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what kind of letters we have written on this subject, I have transmitted for our mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a copy of them, as well for your own information as for that of our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are in those parts. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>
