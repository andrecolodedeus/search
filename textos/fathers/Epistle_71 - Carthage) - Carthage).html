<h1>Epistle 71</h1>

<p><strong>To Stephen, Concerning a Council.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian with His Colleagues in a Certain Council Tells Stephen, the Roman Bishop, that It Had Been Decreed by Them, Both that Those Who Returned from Heresy into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Should Be Baptized, and that Bishops or Priests Coming from the Heretics Should Be Received on No Other Condition, Than that They Should Communicate as Lay People. A.D. 255.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian and others, to Stephen their brother, greeting. We have thought it necessary for the arranging of certain matters, dearest brother, and for their investigation by the examination of a common council, to gather together and to hold a council, at which many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were assembled at once; at which, moreover, many things were brought forward and transacted. But the subject in regard to which we had chiefly to write to you, and to confer with your gravity and wisdom, is one that more especially pertains both to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> authority and to the unity, as well as the dignity, of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, arising as these do from the ordination of the divine appointment; to wit, that those who have been dipped abroad outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and have been stained among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics with the taint of profane water, when they come to us and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is one, ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, for the reason that it is a small matter  to <q>lay hands on them that they may receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> unless they receive also the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For then finally can they be fully sanctified, and be the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if they be born of each sacrament;  since it is written, <q>Unless a man be born again of water, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q>  For we find also, in the Acts of the Apostles, that this is maintained by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and kept in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the saving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that when, in the house of Cornelius the centurion, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> had descended upon the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who were there, fervent in the warmth of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and believing in the Lord with their whole heart; and when, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, they blessed God in various tongues, still none the less the blessed Apostle Peter, mindful of the divine precept and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, commanded that those same men should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> who had already been filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that nothing might seem to be neglected to the observance by the apostolic instruction in all things of the law of the divine precept and <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.  But that that is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> use; and that none of those who oppose Christ can profit by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ; has lately been set forth with care in the letter which was written on that subject to Quintus, our colleague, established in Mauritania; as also in a letter which our colleagues previously wrote to our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> presiding in Numidia, of both which letters I have subjoined copies.</p>

<p>2. We add, however, and connect with what we have said, dearest brother, with common consent and authority, that if, again, any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, who either have been before ordained in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and have subsequently stood forth as traitors and rebels against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or who have been promoted among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> by a profane ordination by the hands of false <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and antichrists contrary to the appointment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and have attempted to offer; in opposition to the one and divine altar, false and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> without, that these also be received when they return, on this condition, that they communicate as <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and hold it to be enough that they should be received to peace, after having stood forth as enemies of peace; and that they ought not, on returning, to retain those arms of ordination and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> with which they rebelled against us. For it behooves <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and ministers, who wait upon the altar and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, to be sound and stainless; since the Lord God speaks in Leviticus, and says, <q>No man that has a stain or a blemish shall come near to offer gifts to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052800"><a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse21">Leviticus&nbsp;21:21</a></span> Moreover, in Exodus, He prescribes this same thing, and says, <q>And let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> which come near to the Lord God sanctify themselves, lest the Lord forsake them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052801"><a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse22">Exodus&nbsp;19:22</a></span> And again: <q>And when they come near to minister at the altar of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, they shall not bear iniquity upon them, lest they die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052802"><a href="../bible/exo028.htm#verse43">Exodus&nbsp;28:43</a></span> But what can be greater iniquity, or what stain can be more odious, than to have stood in opposition to Christ; than to have scattered His Church, which He purchased and founded with His blood; than, unmindful of evangelical peace and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, to have fought with the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of hostile discord against the unanimous and accordant people of God? Such as these, although they themselves return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, still cannot restore and recall with them those who, seduced by them, and forestalled by death without, have perished outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without communion and peace; whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the day of judgment shall be required at the hands of those who have stood forth as the authors and leaders of their ruin. And therefore to such, when they return, it is sufficient that pardon should be granted; since perfidy ought certainly not to receive promotion in the household of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For what do we reserve for the good and innocent, and those who do not depart from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> those who have departed from us, and stood in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>?</p>

<p>3. We have brought these things, dearest brother, to your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, for the sake of our mutual <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and sincere affection; believing that, according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of your religion and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, those things which are no less religious than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> will be approved by you. But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that some will not lay aside what they have once imbibed, and do not easily change their purpose; but, keeping fast the bond of peace and concord among their colleagues, retain certain things peculiar to themselves, which have once been adopted among them. In which behalf we neither do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to, nor impose a law upon, any one, since each prelate has in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the exercise of his will free, as he shall give an account of his conduct to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.  We bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>
