<h1>Epistle 72</h1>

<p><strong>To Jubaianus, Concerning the Baptism of Heretics.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian Refutes a Letter Enclosed to Him by Jubaianus, and with the Greatest Care Collects Whatever He Thinks Will Avail for the Defence of His Cause. Moreover, He Sends Jubaianus a Copy of the Letter to the Numidians and to Quintus, and Probably the Decrees of the Last Synod.</em> </p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Jubaianus his brother, greeting. You have written to me, dearest brother, wishing that the impression of my mind should be signified to you, as to what I think concerning the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; who, placed without, and established outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, arrogate to themselves a matter neither within their right nor their power. This <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> we cannot consider as valid or legitimate, since it is manifestly unlawful among them; and since we have already expressed in our letters what we thought on this matter, I have, as a compendious method, sent you a copy of the same letters, what we decided in council when very many of us were present, and what, moreover, I subsequently wrote back to Quintus, our colleague, when he asked about the same thing. And now also, when we had met together, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as well of the province of Africa as of Numidia, to the number of seventy-one, we established this same matter once more  by our judgment, deciding that there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is appointed in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and that by this those are not re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by us, who at any time come from the adulterous and unhallowed water to be washed and sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the saving water.</p>

<p>2. Nor does what you have described in your letters disturb us, dearest brother, that the Novatians re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those whom they entice from us, since it does not in any wise matter to us what the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> do, so long as we ourselves hold a regard for our power, and the steadfastness of reason and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, after the manner of apes&mdash; which, although they are not men, yet imitate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> doings&mdash; wishes to claim to himself the authority and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while he himself is not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; nay, moreover, has stood forth hitherto as a rebel and enemy against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he arrogates to himself this one, so that he may say that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is with him, and make us <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But we who hold the head and root  of the one Church <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and trust for certain, that nothing is lawful there outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is one  is among us, where he himself also was formerly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, when he maintained both the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divine unity. But if <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> thinks that those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are to be re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside&mdash; without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash; he ought to begin by himself, that he might first be re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with an extraneous and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, since he thinks that after the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, yea, and contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, people are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without. But what sort of a thing is this, that, because <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> dares to do this thing, we are to think that we must not do it! What then? Because <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> also usurps the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> throne, ought we therefore to renounce our throne? Or because <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> endeavours wrongfully to set up an altar and to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, does it behoove us to cease from our altar and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, lest we should appear to be celebrating the same or like things with him? Utterly vain and foolish is it, that because <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> arrogates to himself outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the image of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we should forsake the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>3. But among us it is no new or sudden thing for us to judge that those are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> who come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, since it is now many years and a long time ago, that, under <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>&mdash; a man of worthy memory&mdash; very many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembling together have decided this;  and thenceforward until the present day, so many thousands of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in our provinces have been converted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and have neither despised nor delayed, nay, they have both reasonably and gladly embraced, the opportunity to attain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the life-giving layer and of saving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For it is not difficult for a teacher to insinuate <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and lawful things into his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, who, having condemned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> pravity, and discovered the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, comes for this purpose, that he may learn, and learns for the purpose that he may live. We ought not to increase the stolidity of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> by the patronage of our consent, when they gladly and readily <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>4. Certainly, since I found in the letter the copy of which you transmitted to me, that it was written, <q>That it should not be asked who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, since he who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> might receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> according to what he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>,</q> I thought that this topic was not to be passed by, especially since I observed in the same epistle that mention was also made of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, saying that <q>even those that came from him did not need to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, because they seemed to have been already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> Therefore we ought to consider their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> without, whether in respect of the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they can obtain any <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For if we and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we may also have one <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. If the Patripassians, Anthropians, <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>, Apelletians, Ophites, Marcionites, and other pests, and swords, and poisons of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> for subverting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,  confess the same Father, the same Son, the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the same Church with us, they may also have one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> if they have also one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>5. And lest it should be wearisome to go through all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and to enumerate either the follies or the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of each of them, because it is no pleasure to speak of that which one either dreads or is ashamed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, let us examine in the meantime about <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> alone, the mention of whom has been made in the letter transmitted by you to us, whether the ground of his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> can be made good. For the Lord after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, sending His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, instructed and taught them in what manner they ought to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, saying, <q>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go, therefore, and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q>  He suggests the Trinity, in whose sacrament the nations were to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Does <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> then maintain the Trinity? Does he then assert the same Father, the Creator, as we do? Does he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the same Son, Christ born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, who as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, who bare our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, who conquered death by dying, who by Himself first of all originated the resurrection of the flesh, and showed to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that He had risen in the same flesh? Widely different is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and, moreover, with the other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> nay, with them there is nothing but perfidy, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and contention, which is hostile to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. How then can one who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among them seem to have obtained mission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the divine mercy, by his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when he has not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself? For if, as some suppose, one could receive anything abroad out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> according to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, certainly he has received what he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; but if he believes what is false, he could not receive what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but rather he has received things adulterous and profane, according to what he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<p>6. This matter of profane and adulterous <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a> plainly rebukes, saying, <q>Why do they who afflict me prevail? My wound is hard; whence shall I be healed? While it has indeed become unto me as deceitful water which has no faithfulness.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> makes mention by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of deceitful water which has no faithfulness. What is this deceitful and faithless water? Certainly that which <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> assumes the resemblance of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and frustrates the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by a shadowy pretence. But if, according to a perverted <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one could be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without, and obtain remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he could also attain the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and there is no need that hands should be laid on him when he comes, that he might obtain the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and be sealed. Either he could obtain both privileges without by his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or he who has been without has received neither.</p>

<p>7. But it is manifest where and by whom remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be given; to wit, that which is given in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For first of all the Lord gave that power to Peter, upon whom He built the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and whence He appointed and showed the source of unity&mdash; the power, namely, that whatsoever he loosed on earth should be loosed in heaven. And after the resurrection, also, He speaks to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, saying, <q>As the Father has sent me, even so I send you. And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and says, unto them, Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you retain, they are retained.</q>  Whence we perceive that only they who are set over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and established in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> law, and in the ordinance of the Lord, are allowed to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and to give remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but that without, nothing can either be bound or loosed, where there is none who can either bind or loose anything.</p>

<p>8. Nor do we propose this, dearest brother, without the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>, when we say that all things are arranged by divine direction by a certain law and by special ordinance, and that none can usurp to himself, in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, anything which is not of his own right and power. For Korah, Dathan, and Abiram endeavoured to usurp, in opposition to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the power of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a>; and they did not do without punishment what they unlawfully dared. The sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> also, who placed strange fire upon the altar, were at once consumed in the sight of an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> Lord; which punishment remains to those who introduce strange water by a false <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that the divine vengeance may avenge and chastise when <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> do that in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone is allowed to do.</p>

<p>9. But in respect of the assertion of some concerning those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, that when the Apostles Peter and John came, only hands were imposed on them, that they might receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, yet that they were not re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; we see that that place does not, dearest brother, touch the present case. For they who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and within, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is one, and to which alone it is granted to bestow the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and to remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Philip the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, whom the same <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had sent. And therefore, because they had obtained a legitimate and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, there was no need that they should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> any more, but only that which was needed was performed by Peter and John; viz., that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> being made for them, and hands being imposed, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> should be invoked and poured out upon them, which now too is done among us, so that they who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are brought to the prelates of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and by our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and by the imposition of hands obtain the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and are perfected with the Lord's seal.</p>

<p>10. There is no ground, therefore, dearest brother, for thinking that we should give way to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> so far as to contemplate the betrayal to them of that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is only granted to the one and only Church. It is a good soldier's duty to defend the camp of his general against rebels and enemies. It is the duty of an illustrious leader to keep the standards entrusted to him.  It is written, <q>The Lord your God is a jealous God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052815"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse24">Deuteronomy 4:24</a></span> We who have received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> ought to have a jealousy for the divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; with such a jealousy as that wherewith Phineas both pleased God and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> allayed His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> when He was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and the people were perishing. Why do we receive as allowed an adulterous and alien church, a foe to the divine unity, when we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only one Christ and His one Church? The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, setting forth the likeness of paradise, includes within her walls fruit-bearing trees, whereof that which does not bring forth good fruit is cut off and is cast into the fire. These trees she waters with four rivers, that is, with the four <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, wherewith, by a celestial inundation, she bestows the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of saving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Can any one water from the Church's fountains who is not within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Can one impart those wholesome and saving draughts of paradise to any one if he is perverted, and of himself condemned, and banished outside the fountains of paradise, and has dried up and failed with the dryness of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> thirst?</p>

<p>11. The Lord cries aloud, that <q>whosoever thirsts should come and drink of the rivers of living water that flowed out of His bosom.</q>  Whither is he to come who thirsts? Shall he come to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, where there is no fountain and river of living water at all; or to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is one, and is founded upon one who has received the keys of it by the Lord's voice? It is she who holds and possesses alone all the power of her spouse and Lord. In her we preside; for her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and unity we fight; her <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as well as her <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, we defend with faithful devotedness.  We by the divine permission water the thirsting people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; we guard the boundaries of the living fountains. If, therefore, we hold the right of our possession, if we acknowledge the sacrament of unity, wherefore are we esteemed prevaricators against <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Wherefore are we judged betrayers of unity? The faithful, and saving, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> water of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot be corrupted and adulterated, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself also is uncorrupted, and chaste, and modest. If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are devoted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and established in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they may use both her <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and her other saving benefits. But if they are not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, nay more, if they act against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, how can they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with the Church's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>?</p>

<p>12. For it is no small and insignificant matter, which is conceded to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, when their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is recognised by us; since thence springs the whole origin of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the saving access to the hope of life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and the divine condescension for purifying and quickening the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if any one could be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, certainly he could also obtain remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. If he attained remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he was also sanctified. If he was sanctified, he also was made the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I ask, of what God? If of the Creator; he could not be, because he has not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him. If of Christ; he could not become His temple, since he denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; since the three are one, how can the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> be at peace with him who is the enemy either of the Son or of the Father?</p>

<p>13. Hence it is in vain that some who are overcome by reason oppose to us custom, as if custom were greater than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;  or as if that were not to be sought after in spiritual matters which has been revealed as the better by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For one who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> by simplicity may be pardoned, as the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says of himself, <q>I who at first was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; yet obtained mercy, because I did it <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052819"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse13">1 Timothy 1:13</a></span> But after inspiration and revelation made to him, he who intelligently and knowingly perseveres in that course in which he had erred, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without pardon for his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For he resists with a certain presumption and obstinacy, when he is overcome by reason. Nor let any one say, <q>We follow that which we have received from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,</q> when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> only delivered one Church, and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is not ordained except in the same Church. And we cannot find that any one, when he had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, was received by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and communicated in such a way as that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> should appear to have approved the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>14. For as to what some say, as if it tended to favour <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> declared, <q>Only every way, whether in pretence or in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, let Christ be preached,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052820"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse18">Philippians 1:18</a></span> we find that this also can avail nothing to their benefit who support and applaud <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in his epistle, was not speaking of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, nor of their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, so that anything can be shown to have been alleged which pertained to this matter. He was speaking of brethren, whether as walking disorderly and against the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or as keeping the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And he said that certain of them spoke the word of God with constancy and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, but some acted in <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and dissension; that some maintained towards him a benevolent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but that some indulged a malevolent spirit of dissension; but yet that he bore all patiently, so long only as, whether in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or in pretence, the name of Christ which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> preached might come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many; and the sowing of the word, which as yet had been new and irregular, might increase through the preaching of the speakers. Besides, it is one thing for those who are within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to speak concerning the name of Christ; it is another for those who are without, and act in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore, let not those who favour <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> put forward what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> spoke concerning brethren, but let them show if he thought anything was to be conceded to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, or if he approved of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or if he appointed that perfidious and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> men could receive remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>15. But if we consider what the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> thought about <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, we shall find that they, in all their epistles, execrated and detested the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For when they say that <q>their word creeps as a canker,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052821"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse17">2 Timothy 2:17</a></span> how is such a word as that able to give remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which creeps like a canker to the ears of the hearers? And when they say that there can be no fellowship between righteousness and un-righteousness, no communion between light and darkness,<span class="stiki" id="note052822"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 6:14</a></span> how can either darkness illuminate, or unrighteousness justify? And when they say that <q>they are not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but are of the spirit of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052823"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse3">1 John 4:3</a></span> how can they transact spiritual and divine matters, who are the enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and whose hearts the spirit of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> has possessed? Wherefore, if, laying aside the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> dispute, we return with a sincere and religious <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the evangelical authority and to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> tradition, we shall perceive that they may do nothing towards conferring the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and saving <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, who, scattering and attacking the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are called adversaries by Christ Himself, but by His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, Antichrists.</p>

<p>16. Again, there is no ground for any one, for the circumvention of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, opposing to us the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and saying, <q>All who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> everywhere, and in any manner, in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, have obtained the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>,</q>&mdash; when Christ Himself speaks, and says, <q>Not every one that says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052824"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse21">Matthew 7:21</a></span>, And again, He forewarns and instructs, that no one should be easily deceived by <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> and false Christs in His name. <q>Many,</q> He says, <q>shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many.</q> And afterwards He added: <q>But take heed; behold, I have foretold you all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052825"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse5">Matthew 24:5, 25</a></span> Whence it appears that all things are not at once to be received and assumed which are boasted of in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but only those things which are done in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>17. For whereas in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and in the epistles of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, the name of Christ is alleged for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; it is not in such a way as that the Son alone, without the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, can be of advantage to anybody; but that it might be shown to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who boasted as to their having the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that the Father would profit them nothing, unless they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on the Son whom He had sent. For they who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father the Creator, ought also to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, lest they should flatter and applaud themselves about the Father alone, without the acknowledgment of His Son, who also said, <q>No man comes to the Father but by me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052826"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John 14:6</a></span> But He, the same, sets forth, that it is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the two which saves, when He says, <q>And this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom you have sent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052827"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a></span> Since, therefore, from the preaching and testimony of Christ Himself, the Father who sent must be first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, then afterwards Christ, who was sent, and there cannot be a hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> except by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the two together; how, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, nay, is even <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, can they who among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are said to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, be judged to have obtained the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? For the case of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> under the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> was one, but the condition of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> is another. The former, because they had already gained the most ancient <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the law and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, were to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> also in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, in conformity with what Peter tells them in the Acts of the Apostles, saying, <q>Repent, and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> every one of you in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and you shall receive the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For this promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052828"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse38">Acts 2:38-39</a></span> Peter makes mention of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, not as though the Father should be omitted, but that the Son also might be joined to the Father.</p>

<p>18. Finally, when, after the resurrection, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are sent by the Lord to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, they are bidden to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <q>in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> How, then, do some say, that a Gentile <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without, outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, yea, and in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that it be only in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, everywhere, and in whatever manner, can obtain remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when Christ Himself commands the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the full and united Trinity? Unless while one who denies Christ is denied by Christ, he who denies His Father whom Christ Himself confessed is not denied; and he who blasphemes against Him whom Christ called His Lord and His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is rewarded by Christ, and obtains remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>! But by what power can he who denies God the Creator, the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, obtain, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, since Christ received that very power by which we are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and sanctified, from the same Father, whom He called <q>greater</q> than Himself, by whom He desired to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, whose will He fulfilled even unto the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of drinking the cup, and of undergoing death? What else is it then, than to become a partaker with <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, to wish to maintain and assert, that one who blasphemes and gravely <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the Father and the Lord and God of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, can receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the name of Christ? What, moreover, is that, and of what kind is it, that he who denies the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and he who denies the Father should be thought to have the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, although the Son Himself testifies, and says, <q>No man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my Father? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052829"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse65">John 6:65</a></span> So that it is evident, that no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be received in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, which it is not plain that the Father has granted. Especially, since He further repeats, and says, <q>Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052830"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse13">Matthew 15:13</a></span></p>

<p>19. But if Christ's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> are unwilling to learn from Christ what veneration and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is due to the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, still let them learn from earthly and secular examples, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Christ has declared, not without the strongest rebuke, <q>The children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052831"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse8">Luke 16:8</a></span> In this world of ours, if any one have offered an insult to the father of any; if in injury and frowardness he have wounded his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> and his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by a malevolent tongue, the son is indignant, and wrathful, and with what means he can, strives to avenge his injured father's wrong. Think you that Christ grants impunity to the impious and profane, and the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> of His Father, and that He puts away their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, who it is evident, when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, still heap up <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> words on the person of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with the unceasing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> tongue? Can a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, can a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either conceive this in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or put it forward in discourse? And what will become of the precepts of the divine law, which say, <q>Honour your father and your mother? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052832"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse12">Exodus 20:12</a></span> If the name of father, which in man is commanded to be honoured, is violated with impunity in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what will become of what Christ Himself lays down in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and says, <q>He that curses father or mother, let him die the death; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052833"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse4">Matthew 15:4</a></span> if He who bids that those who curse their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> after the flesh should be punished and slain, Himself quickens those who revile their heavenly and spiritual Father, and are hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, their Mother? An execrable and detestable thing is actually asserted by some, that He who threatens the man who blasphemes against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that he shall be guilty of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, Himself condescends to sanctify those who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father with saving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And now, those who think that they must communicate with such as come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, do not consider that they are becoming partakers with other men's, yea, with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when they admit without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> those who cannot, except in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, put off the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>.</p>

<p>20. Besides, how vain and perverse a thing it is, that when the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> themselves, having repudiated and forsaken either the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in which they had previously been, acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we should mutilate the rights and sacrament of that same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and say to those who come to us and repent, that they had obtained remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> when they confess that they have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and are for that reason come to seek the pardon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>! Wherefore, dearest brother, we ought both firmly to maintain the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to teach, and by all the evangelical and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> precepts to set forth, the plan of the divine dispensation and unity.</p>

<p>21. Can the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> be greater or of more avail than confession, than suffering, when one confesses Christ before men and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in his own blood? And yet even this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does not benefit a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, although he has confessed Christ, and been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, unless the patrons and advocates of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> declare that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who are slain in a false confession of Christ are <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and assign to them the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> contrary to the testimony of the apostle, who says that it will profit them nothing although they were burnt and slain. <span class="stiki" id="note052834"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 13:3</a></span> But if not even the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of a public confession and blood can profit a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, because there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,  how much less shall it be of advantage to him, if in a hiding-place and a cave of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, stained with the contagion of adulterous water, he has not only not put off his old <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but rather heaped up still newer and greater ones! Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> cannot be common to us and to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>,to whom neither <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, is common. And therefore it behooves those to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> who come from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that so they who are prepared, in the lawful, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and only <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, by divine regeneration, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, may be born of both <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, because it is written, <q>Unless a man be born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> </p>

<p>22. On which place some, as if by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasoning they were able to make void the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> declaration, object to us the case of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>; asking if any one of these, before he is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, should be apprehended and slain on confession of the name, whether he would lose the hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and the reward of confession, because he had not previously been born again of water? Let men of this kind, who are aiders and favourers of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> therefore, first, that those <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> hold the sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and advance from the divine camp to do battle with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, with a full and sincere acknowledgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; then, that they certainly are not deprived of the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and greatest <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of blood, concerning which the Lord also said, that He had <q>another <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with.</q>  But the same Lord declares in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in their own blood, and sanctified by suffering, are perfected, and obtain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the divine promise, when He speaks to the thief believing and confessing in His very passion, and promises that he should be with Himself in paradise. Wherefore we who are set over the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ought not to deceive and mislead those who come to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and repent, and beg that their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be remitted to them; but to instruct them when corrected by us, and reformed for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> by celestial discipline.</p>

<p>23. But some one says, <q>What, then, shall become of those who in past times, coming from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, were received without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? </q>The Lord is able by His mercy to give indulgence,  and not to separate from the gifts of His Church those who by simplicity were admitted into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have fallen asleep. Nevertheless it does not follow that, because there was <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> at one time, there must always be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; since it is more fitting for wise and God-fearing men, gladly and without delay to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when laid open and perceived, than pertinaciously and obstinately to struggle against brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on behalf of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>24. Nor let any one think that, because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is proposed to them, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> will be kept back from coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as if offended at the name of a second <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; nay, but on this very account they are rather driven to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of coming by the testimony of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shown and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to them. For if they shall see that it is determined and decreed by our judgment and sentence, that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> wherewith they are there <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is considered just and legitimate, they will think that they are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and legitimately in possession of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also, and the other gifts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; nor will there be any reason for their coming to us, when, as they have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, they seem also to have the rest. But further, when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> without, and that no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be given outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they more eagerly and readily hasten to us, and implore the gifts and benefits of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> our Mother, assured that they can in no wise attain to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> promise of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> unless they first come to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nor will <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> refuse to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among us with the lawful and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when they shall have learned from us that they also were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who already had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John,  as we read in the Acts of the Apostles.</p>

<p>25. And now by certain of us the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is asserted to occupy the (like) ground, and, as if by a certain dislike of re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, it is counted unlawful to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> after God's enemies. <em>And this</em>, although we find that they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> whom John had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: John, esteemed the greatest among the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; John, filled with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> even in his mother's womb; who was sustained with the spirit and power of Elias; who was not an adversary of the Lord, but His precursor and announcer; who not only foretold our Lord in words, but even showed Him to the eyes; who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Christ Himself by whom others are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. But if on that account a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> could obtain the right of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, because he first <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, then <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> will not belong to the person that has it, but to the person that seizes it. And since <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can by no means be separated from one another, and divided, he who has first been able to lay hold on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> has equally also laid hold on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and you begin to appear to him as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, when you being anticipated, have begun to be last, and by yielding and giving way have relinquished the right which you had received. But how dangerous it is in divine matters, that any one should depart from his right and power, <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> declares when, in Genesis, <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> thence lost his birthright, nor was able afterwards to regain that which he had once given up.</p>

<p>26. These things, dearest brother, I have briefly written to you, according to my abilities, prescribing to none, and prejudging none, so as to prevent any one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> doing what he thinks well, and having the free exercise of his judgment.  We, as far as in us lies, do not contend on behalf of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> with our colleagues and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with whom we maintain a divine concord and the peace of the Lord;  especially since the apostle says, <q>If any man, however, is thought to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>.</q>  Charity of spirit, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of our college, the bond of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> concord, are maintained by us with patience and gentleness. For this reason, moreover, we have with the best of our poor abilities, with the permission and inspiration of the Lord, written a treatise  on the <q>Benefit of Patience,</q> which for the sake of our mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we have transmitted to you. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>
