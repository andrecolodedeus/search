<h1>Epistle 73</h1>

<p><strong>To Pompey, Against the Epistle of Stephen About the Baptism of Heretics.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; The Purport of This Epistle is Given in St. Augustine's <q>Contra Donatistas,</q> Lib. V. Cap. 23. He Says There: <q>Cyprian, Moreover, Writes to Pompey on the Same Subject, When He Plainly Signifies that Stephen, Who, as We Learn, Was Then a Bishop of the Roman Church, Not Only Did Not Agree with Him on Those Points, But Even Had Written and Charged in Opposition to Him.</q></em> </p>

<p>1. Cyprian to his brother Pompeius, greeting. Although I have fully comprised what is to be said concerning the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in the letters of which I sent you copies, dearest brother, yet, since you have desired that what Stephen our brother replied to my letters should be brought to your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, I have sent you a copy of his reply; on the reading of which, you will more and more observe his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in endeavouring to maintain the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>.  For among other matters, which were either haughtily assumed, or were not pertaining to the matter, or contradictory to his own view, which he unskilfully and without foresight wrote, he moreover added this saying: <q>If any one, therefore, come to you from any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> whatever, let nothing be innovated (or done) which has not been handed down, to wit, that hands be imposed on him for repentance;  since the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> themselves, in their own proper character, do not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> such as come to them from one another, but only admit them to communion.</q></p>

<p>2. He forbade one coming from any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; that is, he judged the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to be just and lawful. And although special <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> have special baptisms and different <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he, holding communion with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of all, gathered up the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all, heaped together into his own bosom. And he charged that nothing should be innovated except what had been handed down; as if he were an innovator, who, holding the unity, claims for the one Church one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and not manifestly he who, forgetful of unity, adopts the lies and the contagions of a profane washing. Let nothing be innovated, says he, <em>nothing maintained</em>, except what has been handed down. Whence is that tradition? Whether does it descend from the authority of the Lord and of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, or does it come from the commands and the epistles of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? For that those things which are written must be done, God witnesses and admonishes, saying to Joshua the son of Nun: <q>The book of this law shall not depart out of your mouth; but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052848"><a href="../bible/jos001.htm#verse8">Joshua&nbsp;1:8</a></span> Also the Lord, sending His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, commands that the nations should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and taught to observe all things which He commanded. If, therefore, it is either prescribed in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, or contained in the epistles or Acts of the Apostles, that those who come from any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but only hands laid upon them to repentance, let this divine and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> tradition be observed. But if everywhere <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are called nothing else than adversaries and antichrists, if they are pronounced to be people to be avoided, and to be perverted and condemned of their own selves, wherefore is it that they should not be thought worthy of being condemned by us, since it is evident from the apostolic testimony  that they are of their own selves condemned? So that no one ought to defame the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> as if they had approved of the baptisms of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or had communicated with them without the Church's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, when they, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, wrote such things of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. And this, too, while as yet the more terrible plagues of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> had not broken forth; while <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> had not yet emerged from <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, whose master Cerdon came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>&mdash;while <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a> was still <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was the ninth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in that city&mdash;whom <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> followed, and with greater impudence adding other enhancements to his crime, and more daringly set himself to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Creator, and armed with <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> arms the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> that rebelled against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and determination.</p>

<p>3. But if it is evident that subsequently <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> became more numerous and worse; and if, in time past, it was never at all prescribed nor written that only hands should be laid upon a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> for repentance, and that so he might be communicated with; and if there is only one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is with us, and is within, and is granted of the divine condescension to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone, what obstinacy is that, or what presumption, to prefer <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> tradition to divine ordinance, and not to observe that God is indignant and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> as often as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> tradition relaxes and passes by the divine precepts, as He cries out, and says by Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>This people honours me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. But in vain do they worship me, teaching the doctrines and commandments of men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052850"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13</a></span> Also the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, similarly rebuking and reproving, utters and says, <q>You reject the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may keep your own tradition.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052851"><a href="../bible/mar007.htm#verse13">Mark&nbsp;7:13</a></span> Mindful of which precept, the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> himself also warns and instructs, saying, <q>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to the wholesome words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and to His doctrine, he is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing: from such withdraw yourself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052852"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:3-5</a></span> </p>

<p>4. Certainly an excellent and lawful tradition is set before us by the teaching of our brother Stephen, which may afford us a suitable authority! For in the same place of his epistle he has added and continued: <q>Since those who are specially <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> do not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those who come to them from one another, but only receive them to communion.</q> To this point of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> and spouse of Christ been developed, that she follows the examples of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; that for the purpose of celebrating the celestial <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, light should borrow her discipline from darkness, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should do that which antichrists do. But what is that blindness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, what is that degradation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to refuse to recognise the unity  which comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and from the tradition of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the Lord and our God! For if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, therefore, because it is one, and cannot be divided; and if thus the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not there, because He is one, and cannot be among profane <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and those who are without; certainly also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which consists in the same unity, cannot be among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, because it can neither be separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> nor from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>5. Or if they attribute the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to the majesty of the name, so that they who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> anywhere and anyhow, in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, are judged to be renewed and sanctified; wherefore, in the name of the same Christ, are not hands laid upon the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> among them, for the reception of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? Why does not the same majesty of the same name avail in the imposition of hands, which, they contend, availed in the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? For if any one born out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can become God's temple, why cannot the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also be poured out upon the temple? For he who has been sanctified, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> being put away in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and has been spiritually reformed into a new man, has become fitted for receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; since the apostle says, <q>As many of you as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ have put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052854"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians 3:27</a></span> He who, having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, is able to put on Christ, may much more receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> whom Christ sent. Otherwise He who is sent will be greater than Him who sends; so that one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without may begin indeed to put on Christ, but not to be able to receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as if Christ could either be put on without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, or the Spirit be separated from Christ. Moreover, it is silly to say, that although the second birth is spiritual, by which we are born in Christ through the layer of regeneration, one may be born spiritually among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, where they say that the Spirit is not. For water alone is not able to cleanse away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to sanctify a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unless he have also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.  Wherefore it is necessary that they should grant the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be there, where they say that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is; or else there is no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not, because there cannot be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> without the Spirit.</p>

<p>6. But what a thing it is, to assert and contend that they who are not born in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can be the sons of God! For the blessed apostle sets forth and proves that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is that wherein the old man dies and the new man is born, saying, <q>He saved us by the washing of regeneration.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052856"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus 3:5</a></span> But if regeneration is in the washing, that is, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, how can <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which is not the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, generate sons to God by Christ? For it is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone which, conjoined and united with Christ, spiritually bears sons; as the same apostle again says, <q>Christ loved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify it, cleansing it with the washing of water.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052857"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians 5:25-26</a></span> If, then, she is the beloved and spouse who alone is sanctified by Christ, and alone is cleansed by His washing, it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which is not the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor can be cleansed nor sanctified by His washing, cannot bear sons to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p>7. But further, one is not born by the imposition of hands when he receives the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that so, being already born, he may receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, even as it happened in the first man Adam. For first God formed him, and then breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. For the Spirit cannot be received, unless he who receives first have an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But as the birth of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, while the generation and sanctification of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> are with the spouse of Christ alone, who is able spiritually to conceive and to bear sons to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where and of whom and to whom is he born, who is not a son of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so as that he should have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as his Father, before he has had the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for his Mother? But as no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> at all, and equally no <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, being without, can have the sanctification of saving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, why has the bitter obstinacy of our brother Stephen broken forth to such an extent, as to contend that sons are born to God from the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>; moreover, of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, and of others who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; and to say that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is granted in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> where <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is uttered against the Father and against Christ the Lord God?</p>

<p>8. In which place, dearest brother, we must consider, for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the religion of the sacerdotal office which we discharge, whether the account can be satisfactory in the day of judgment for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who maintains, and approves, and acquiesces in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>, when the Lord threatens, and says, <q>And now, O you <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, this commandment is for you: if you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> unto my name, says the Lord Almighty, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings.</q>  Does he give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who communicates with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>? Does he give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who judges that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is granted among those who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against God? Does he give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who affirms that sons are born to God without, of an adulterer and a harlot? Does he give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who does not hold the unity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that arise from the divine law, but maintains <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Does he give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, a friend of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and an enemy to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, thinks that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who support the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Christ and the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>?  If <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is thus given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and the discipline of God is thus preserved by His worshippers and His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, let us cast away our arms; let us give ourselves up to captivity; let us deliver to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> the ordination of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, the appointment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the majesty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; let the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the divine warfare be loosed; let the standards of the heavenly camp be betrayed; and let the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> succumb and yield to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, light to darkness, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to perfidy, hope to despair, reason to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> to death, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, Christ to <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>! Deservedly thus do <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms arise day by day, more frequently and more fruitfully grow up, and with serpents' locks shoot forth and cast out against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> with greater force the poison of their venom; while, by the advocacy of some, both authority and support are afforded them; while their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is defended, while <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, while <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is betrayed;  while that which is done without against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is defended within in the very Church itself.</p>

<p>9. But if there be among us, most beloved brother, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> prevail, if we keep the precepts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if we guard the incorrupt and inviolate <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of His spouse, if the words of the Lord abide in our thoughts and hearts, when he says, <q>Do you think, when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> comes, shall He find <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the earth</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052862"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse8">Luke 18:8</a></span> then, because we are God's faithful soldiers, who <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and sincere religion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us keep the camp entrusted to us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with faithful valour. Nor ought custom, which had crept in among some, to prevent the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from prevailing and conquering; for custom without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the antiquity of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.  On which account, let us forsake the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and follow the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that in Esdras also the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> conquers, as it is written: <q>Truth endures and grows strong to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and lives and prevails for ever and ever. With her there is no accepting of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or distinctions; but what is just she does: nor in her judgments is there unrighteousness, but the strength, and the kingdom, and the majesty, and the power of all ages. Blessed be the Lord God of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>!</q>  This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> Christ showed to us in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and said, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052865"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John 14:6</a></span> Wherefore, if we are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and have Christ in us, if we abide in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> abides in us, let us keep fast those things which are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</p>

<p>10. But it happens, by a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of presumption and of obstinacy, that one would rather maintain his own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and false position, than agree in the right and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which belongs to another. Looking forward to which, the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> writes to Timothy, and warns him that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must not be <q>litigious, nor contentious, but gentle and teachable.</q>  Now he is teachable who is meek and gentle to the patience of learning. For it behooves a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> not only to teach, but also to learn; because he also teaches better who daily increases and advances by learning better; which very thing, moreover, the same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> teaches, when he admonishes, <q>that if anything better be revealed to one sitting by, the first should hold his peace.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052867"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse30">1 Corinthians 14:30</a></span> But there is a brief way for religious and simple minds, both to put away <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and to find and to elicit <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For if we return to the head and source of divine tradition, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> ceases; and having seen the reason of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, whatever lay hid in obscurity under the gloom and cloud of darkness, is opened into the light of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. If a channel supplying water, which formerly flowed plentifully and freely, suddenly fail, do we not go to the fountain, that there the reason of the failure may be ascertained, whether from the drying up of the springs the water has failed at the fountainhead, or whether, flowing thence free and full, it has failed in the midst of its course; that so, if it has been caused by the fault of an interrupted or leaky channel, that the constant stream does not flow uninterruptedly and continuously, then the channel being repaired and strengthened, the water collected may be supplied for the use and drink of the city, with the same fertility and plenty with which it issues from the spring? And this it behooves the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of God to do now, if they would keep the divine precepts, that if in any respect the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have wavered and vacillated, we should return to our original and Lord, and to the evangelical and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> tradition; and thence may arise the ground of our action, whence has taken rise both our order and our origin. </p>

<p>11. For it has been delivered to us, that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, and one Christ, and one hope, and one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and one Church, and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> ordained only in the one Church, from which unity whosoever will depart must needs be found with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; and while he upholds them against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he impugns the sacrament of the divine tradition. The sacrament of which unity we see expressed also in the Canticles, in the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who says, <q>A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse, a fountain sealed, a well of living water, a garden with the fruit of apples.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052869"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse12">Song of Songs 4:12-13</a></span> But if His Church is a garden enclosed, and a fountain sealed, how can he who is not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> enter into the same garden, or drink from its fountain? Moreover, Peter himself, showing and vindicating the unity, has commanded and warned us that we cannot be saved, except by the one only <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of one Church. <q>In the ark,</q> says he, <q>of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, few, that is, eight <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, were saved by water, as also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> shall in like manner save you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052870"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse20">1 Peter 3:20-21</a></span> In how short and spiritual a summary has he set forth the sacrament of unity! For as, in that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the world in which its ancient iniquity was purged away, he who was not in the ark of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> could not be saved by water, so neither can he appear to be saved by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> who has not been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is established in the unity  of the Lord according to the sacrament of the one ark.</p>

<p>12. Therefore, dearest brother, having explored and seen the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; it is observed and held by us, that all who are converted from any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> whatever to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the only and lawful <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, with the exception of those who had previously been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and so had passed over to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.  For it behooves these, when they return, having repented, to be received by the imposition of hands only, and to be restored by the shepherd to the sheep-fold whence they had strayed. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>
