<h1>Epistle 74</h1>

<p><strong>Firmilian, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, to Cyprian, Against the Letter of Stephen. A.D. 256.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; The Argument of This Letter is Exactly the Same as that of the Previous One, But Written with a Little More Vehemence and Acerbity Than Becomes a Bishop</em>,  <em>Chiefly for the Reason, as May Be Suspected, that Stephen Had Also Written Another Letter to Firmilianus, Helenus, and Other Bishops of Those Parts.</em> </p>

<p>1. to Cyprian, his brother in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, greeting. We have received by Rogatian, our beloved <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, the letter sent by you which you wrote to us, well-beloved brother; and we gave the greatest thanks to the Lord, because it has happened that we who are separated from one another in body are thus united in spirit, as if we were not only occupying one country, but inhabiting together one and the self-same house. Which also it is becoming for us to say, because, indeed, the spiritual house of God is one. <q>For it shall come to pass in the last days,</q> says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>that the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, and the house of God above the tops of the mountains.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052876"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;2:2</a></span> Those that come together into this house are united with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, according to what is asked from the Lord in the psalm, to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of one's life. Whence in another place also it is made manifest, that among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> there is great and desirous <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for assembling together. <q>Behold,</q> he says, <q>how good and how pleasant a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!</q> </p>

<p>2. For unity and peace and concord afford the greatest pleasure not only to men who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but also to heavenly <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves, to whom the divine word says it is a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> when one sinner repents and returns to the bond of unity. But assuredly this would not be said of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who have their conversation in heaven, unless they themselves also were united to us, who <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at our unity; even as, on the other hand, they are assuredly saddened when they see the diverse minds and the divided wills of some, as if not only they do not together invoke one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as if, separated and divided from one another, they can neither have a common conversation nor discourse.  Except that we may in this matter give thanks to Stephen, that it has now happened through his unkindness that we receive the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and wisdom. But although we have received the favour of this benefit on account of Stephen, certainly Stephen has not done anything deserving of kindness and thanks. For neither can Judas be thought worthy by his perfidy and treachery wherewith he wickedly dealt concerning the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, as though he had been the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of such great advantages, that through him the world and the people of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were delivered by the Lord's passion.</p>

<p>3. But let these things which were done by Stephen be passed by for the present, lest, while we remember his audacity and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, we bring a more lasting sadness on ourselves from the things that he has wickedly done.  And <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, concerning you, that you have settled this matter, concerning which there is now a question, according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the wisdom of Christ; we have exulted with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and have given God thanks that we have found in brethren placed at such a distance such a unanimity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with us. For the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is mighty to associate and join together in the bond of charity and unity even those things which seem to be divided by a considerable space of earth, according to the way in which of old also the divine power associated in the bond of unanimity Ezekiel and Daniel, though later in their age, and separated from them by a long space of time, to Job and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, who were among the first; so that although they were separated by long periods, yet by divine inspiration they felt the same truths. And this also we now observe in you, that you who are separated from us by the most extensive regions, approve yourselves to be, nevertheless, joined with us in mind and spirit. All which arises from the divine unity. For even as the Lord who dwells in us is one and the same, He everywhere joins and couples His own people in the bond of unity, whence their sound has gone out into the whole earth, who are sent by the Lord swiftly running in the spirit of unity; as, on the other hand, it is of no advantage that some are very near and joined together bodily, if in spirit and mind they differ, since <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> cannot at all be united which divide themselves from God's unity. <q>For, lo,</q> it says, <q>they that are far from You shall perish.</q>  But such shall undergo the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> according to their desert, as depart from His words who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> to the Father for unity, and says, <q>Father, grant that, as You and I are one, so they also may be one in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052881"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;17:21</a></span> </p>

<p>4. But we receive those things which you have written as if they were our own; nor do we read them cursorily, but by frequent repetition have committed them to memory. Nor does it hinder saving usefulness, either to repeat the same things for the confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or, moreover, to add some things for the sake of accumulating <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. But if anything has been added by us, it is not added as if there had been too little said by you; but since the divine discourse surpasses <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot conceive or grasp the whole and perfect word, therefore also the number of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> is so great, that the divine wisdom in its multiplicity may be distributed through many. Whence also he who first speaks in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is bidden to be silent if a revelation be made to a second. For which reason it happens of necessity among us, that year by year we, the elders and prelates, assemble together to arrange those matters which are committed to our care, so that if any things are more serious they may be directed by the common counsel. Moreover, <em>we do this</em> that some remedy may be sought for by repentance for lapsed brethren, and for those wounded by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> after the saving layer, not as though they obtained remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from us, but that by our means they may be converted to the understanding of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and may be compelled to give fuller satisfaction to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</p>

<p>5. But since that messenger sent by you was in haste to return to you, and the winter season was pressing, we replied what we could to your letter. And indeed, as respects what Stephen has said, as though the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> forbade those who come from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and delivered this also to be observed by their successors, you have replied most abundantly, that no one is so foolish as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> delivered this, when it is even well known that these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> themselves, execrable and detestable as they are, arose subsequently; when even <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Cerdo is found to have introduced his <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> tradition against God long after the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and after long lapse of time from them. <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, also consenting to his <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, added many other new and more important matters hostile to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But also the time of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> is manifest, that they too, after the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and after a long period, rebelled against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> with their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> lies. It is plain that the other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, also, afterwards introduced their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and perverse inventions, even as every one was led by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; all of whom, it is evident, were self-condemned, and have declared against themselves an inevitable sentence before the day of judgment; and he who confirms the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of these, what else does he do but adjudge himself with them, and condemn himself, making himself a partaker with such?</p>

<p>6. But that they who are at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> do not observe those things in all cases which are handed down from the beginning, and vainly pretend the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>;  any one may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also from the fact, that concerning the celebration of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and concerning many other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of divine matters, he may see that there are some diversities among them, and that all things are not observed among them alike, which are observed at Jerusalem, just as in very many other provinces also many things are varied because of the difference of the places and names.  And yet on this account there is no departure at all from the peace and unity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, such as Stephen has now dared to make;  breaking the peace against you, which his predecessors have always kept with you in mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, even herein defaming Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  as if the very men delivered this who in their epistles execrated <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and warned us to avoid them. Whence it appears that this tradition is of men which maintains <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and asserts that they have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone.</p>

<p>7. But, moreover, you have well answered that part where Stephen said in his letter that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> themselves also are of one mind in respect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and that they do not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> such as come to them from one another, but only communicate with them; as if we also ought to do this. In which place, although you have already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that it is sufficiently ridiculous for any one to follow those that are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, yet we add this moreover, over and above, that it is not wonderful for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to act thus, who, although in some lesser matters they differ, yet in that which is greatest they hold one and the same agreement to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the Creator, figuring for themselves certain dreams and phantasms of an unknown God. Assuredly it is but natural that these should agree in having a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is unreal,  in the same way as they agree in repudiating the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divinity. Of whom, since it is tedious to reply to their several statements, either <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> or foolish, it is sufficient shortly to say in sum, that they who do not hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lord the Father cannot hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> either of the Son or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; according to which also they who are called Cataphrygians, and endeavour to claim to themselves new prophecies, can have neither the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <em>nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a></em>,  of whom, if we ask what Christ they announce, they will reply that they preach Him who sent the Spirit that speaks by <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> and Prisca. And in these, when we observe that there has been not the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they who maintain their false prophesying against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Christ cannot have Christ. Moreover, all other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, if they have separated themselves from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, can have nothing of power or of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since all power and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are established in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> where the elders  preside, who possess the power both of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, and of imposition of hands, and of ordaining. For as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> may not lawfully ordain nor lay on hands, so neither may he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, nor do any thing holily or spiritually, since he is an alien from spiritual and deifying <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. All which we some time back confirmed in Iconium, which is a place in Phrygia, when we were assembled together with those who had gathered from Galatia and Cilicia, and other neighbouring countries, as to be held and firmly vindicated against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, when there was some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in certain minds concerning that matter. </p>

<p>8. And as Stephen and those who agree with him contend that putting away of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and second birth may result from the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, among whom they themselves confess that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not; let them consider and understand that spiritual birth cannot be without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; in conformity with which also the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> anew with a spiritual <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> those who had already been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John before the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had been sent by the Lord, and so laid hands on them that they might receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But what kind of a thing is it, that when we see that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, after John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> again, we are hesitating to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those who come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> after their unhallowed and profane dipping. Unless, perchance, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was inferior to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of these times, so that these indeed can by imposition of hands alone give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who come (to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>), while <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was not fitted to give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by imposition of hands to those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John, unless he had first <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> them also with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>9. That, moreover, is absurd, that they do not think it is to be inquired who was the person that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, for the reason that he who has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> may have obtained <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by the invocation of the Trinity, of the names of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Then this will be the wisdom which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writes is in those who are perfected. But who in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is perfect and wise who can either defend or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, that this bare invocation of names is sufficient to the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; since these things are only then of advantage, when both he who baptizes has the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself also is not ordained without the Spirit? But, say they, he who in any manner whatever is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without, may obtain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by his disposition and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which doubtless is ridiculous in itself, as if either a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> disposition could attract to itself from heaven the sanctification of the righteous, or a false <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. But that not all who call on the name of Christ are heard, and that their invocation cannot obtain any <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the Lord Himself manifests, saying, <q>Many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052890"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse6">Mark 13:6</a></span> Because there is no difference between a <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a> and a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. For as the former deceives in the name of God or Christ, so the latter deceives in the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Both strive by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> to deceive men's wills.</p>

<p>10. But I wish to relate to you some facts concerning a circumstance which occurred among us, pertaining to this very matter. About two-and-twenty years ago, in the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> after the Emperor Alexander, there happened in these parts many struggles and difficulties, either in general to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or privately to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Moreover, there were many and frequent earthquakes, so that many places were overthrown throughout Cappadocia and <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>; even certain cities, dragged into the abyss, were swallowed up by the opening of the gaping earth. So that from this also a severe <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> arose against us of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name; and this after the long peace of the previous age arose suddenly, and with its unusual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> was made more terrible for the disturbance of our people. Serenianus was then governor in our province, a bitter and terrible persecutor. But the faithful being set in this state of disturbance, and fleeing here and there for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and leaving their country and passing over into other regions&mdash; for there was an opportunity of passing over, for the reason that that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was not over the whole world, but was local&mdash; there arose among us on a sudden a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who in a state of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> announced herself as a prophetess, and acted as if filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And she was so moved by the impetus of the principal <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, that for a long time she made anxious and deceived the brotherhood, accomplishing certain wonderful and portentous things, and promised that she would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the earth to be shaken. Not that the power of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> was so great that he could prevail to shake the earth, or to disturb the elements; but that sometimes a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit, prescient, and perceiving that there will be an earthquake, pretends that he will do what he sees will happen. By these lies and boastings he had so subdued the minds of individuals, that they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> him and followed wherever he commanded and led. He would also make that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> walk in the keen winter with bare feet over frozen snow, and not to be troubled or hurt in any degree by that walking. Moreover, she would say that she was hurrying to <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and to Jerusalem, feigning as if she had come thence. Here also she deceived one of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, a countryman, and another, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, so that they had intercourse with that same <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, which was shortly afterwards detected. For on a sudden there appeared unto her one of the exorcists, a man approved and always of good conversation in respect of religious discipline; who, stimulated by the exhortation also of very many brethren who were themselves strong and praiseworthy in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, raised himself up against that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit to overcome it; which moreover, by its subtle fallacy, had predicted this a little while before, that a certain adverse and unbelieving tempter would come. Yet that exorcist, inspired by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, bravely resisted, and showed that that which was before thought <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, was indeed a most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit. But that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who previously by wiles and deceitfulness of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> was attempting many things for the deceiving of the faithful, among other things by which she had deceived many, also had frequently dared this; to pretend that with an invocation not to be contemned she sanctified bread and celebrated  the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, and to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the Lord, not without the sacrament of the accustomed utterance; and also to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> many, making use of the usual and lawful words of interrogation, that nothing might seem to be different from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rule.</p>

<p>11. What, then, shall we say about the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, by which a most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> through means of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? Do Stephen and they who agree with him approve of this also especially when neither the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the Trinity nor the legitimate and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interrogatory were wanting to her? Can it be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that either remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was given, or the regeneration of the saving layer duly completed, when all things, although after the image of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, yet were done by a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>? Unless, perchance, they who defend the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> contend that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> also conferred the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Among them, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, there is the same <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>&mdash; it is the very deceitfulness of devils, since among them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not at all.</p>

<p>12. Moreover, what is the meaning of that which Stephen would assert, that the presence and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of Christ is with those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>? For if the apostle does not speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> when he says, <q>As many of you as are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ, have put on Christ,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052892"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians 3:27</a></span> certainly he who has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among them into Christ, has put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But if he has put on Christ, he might also receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who was sent by Christ, and hands are vainly laid upon him who comes to us for the reception of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; unless, perhaps, he has <em>not</em> put on the Spirit from Christ, so that Christ indeed may be with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> not be with them.</p>

<p>13. But let us briefly run through the other matters also, which were spoken of by you abundantly and most fully, especially as Rogatianus, our well-beloved <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, is hurrying to you. For it follows that they must be asked by us, when they defend <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, whether their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is carnal or spiritual. For if it is carnal, they differ in no respect from the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, which they use in such a manner that in it, as if in a common and vulgar laver, only external filth is washed away. But if it is spiritual, how can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> be spiritual among those among whom there is no <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? And thus the water wherewith they are washed is to them only a carnal washing, not a sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>14. But if the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> can have the regeneration of the second birth, those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among them must be counted not <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the second birth, which occurs in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, begets sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if the spouse of Christ is one, which is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is she herself who alone bears sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For there are not many spouses of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since the apostle says, <q>I have espoused you, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052893"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 11:2</a></span> and, <q>Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own people, for the King has greatly desired your beauty; </q>  and, Come with me, my spouse, from Lebanon; you shall come, and shall pass over from the source of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;  <span class="stiki" id="note052895"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse8">Song of Songs 4:8</a></span> and, <q>I have come into my garden, my sister, my spouse.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052896"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse1">Song of Songs 5:1</a></span> We see that one person is everywhere set forward, because also the spouse is one. But the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is not one with us, because the spouse is not an adulteress and a harlot. Whence also she cannot bear children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; unless, as appears to Stephen, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> indeed brings them forth and exposes them, while the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> takes them up when exposed, and nourishes those for her own whom she has not born, although she cannot be the mother of strange children. And therefore Christ our Lord, setting forth that His spouse is one, and declaring the sacrament of His unity, says, <q>He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052897"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse23">Luke 11:23</a></span> For if Christ is with us, but the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are not with us, certainly the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are in opposition to Christ; and if we gather with Christ, but the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> do not gather with us, doubtless they scatter.</p>

<p>15. But neither must we pass over what has been necessarily remarked by you, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to the Song of Songs, is a garden enclosed, and a fountain sealed, a paradise with the fruit of apples.<span class="stiki" id="note052898"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse12">Song of Songs 4:12-13</a></span> They who have never entered into this garden, and have not seen the paradise planted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Creator, how shall they be able to afford to another the bring water of the saving lava from the fountain which is enclosed within, and sealed with a divine seal? And as the ark of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> was nothing else than the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which then, when all without were perishing, kept those only safe who were within the ark, we are manifestly instructed to look to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Even as also the Apostle Peter laid down, saying, <q>Thus also shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in like manner make you safe; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052899"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse21">1 Peter 3:21</a></span> showing that as they who were not in the ark with <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> not only were not purged and saved by water, but at once perished in that deluge; so now also, whoever are not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with Christ will perish outside, unless they are converted by penitence to the only and saving lava of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>16. But what is the greatness of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and what the depth of his blindness, who says that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be granted in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and does not abide on the foundation of the one Church which was once based by Christ upon the rock, may be perceived from this, that Christ said to Peter alone, <q>Whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052900"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a></span> And again, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, when Christ breathed on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> alone, saying, <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you remit they are remitted unto them, and whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you retain they are retained.</q>  Therefore the power of remitting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was given to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and to the churches which they, sent by Christ, established, and to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who succeeded to them by vicarious ordination.  But the enemies of the one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in which we are, and the adversaries of us who have succeeded the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, asserting for themselves, in opposition to us, unlawful priesthoods, and setting up profane altars, what else are they than Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, profane with a like <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and about to suffer the same punishments which they did, as well as those who agree with them, just as their partners and abettors perished with a like death to theirs?</p>

<p>17. And in this respect I am <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> indignant at this so open and manifest folly of Stephen, that he who so boasts of the place of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, and contends that he holds the succession from Peter,  on whom the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were laid, should introduce many other rocks and establish new buildings of many churches; maintaining that there is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in them by his authority. For they who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, doubtless, fill up the number of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But he who approves their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> maintains, of those <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is also with them. Nor does he understand that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Rock is overshadowed, and in some measure abolished, by him when he thus betrays and deserts unity.  The apostle acknowledges that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, although blinded by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and bound by the grossest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, have yet a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for God. Stephen, who announces that he holds by succession the throne of Peter, is stirred with no <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, when he concedes to them, not a moderate, but the very greatest power of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: so far as to say and assert that, by the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the filth of the old man is washed away by them, that they pardon the former mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that they make sons of God by heavenly regeneration, and renew to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life by the sanctification of the divine layer. He who concedes and gives up to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in this way the great and heavenly gifts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, what else does he do but communicate with them for whom he maintains and claims so much <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? And now he hesitates in vain to consent to them, and to be a partaker with them in other matters also, to meet together with them, and equally with them to mingle their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and appoint a common altar and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</p>

<p>18. But, says he, the name of Christ is of great advantage to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; so that whosoever is anywhere so-ever <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, immediately obtains the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ: although this position may be briefly met and answered, that if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> without in the name of Christ availed for the cleansing of man; in the name of the same Christ, the imposition of hands might avail also for the reception of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and the other things also which are done among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> will begin to seem just and lawful when they are done in the name of Christ; as you have maintained in your letter that the name of Christ could be of no avail except in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone, to which alone Christ has conceded the power of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>19. But with respect to the refutation of custom which they seem to oppose to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, who is so foolish as to prefer custom to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or when he sees the light, not to forsake the darkness?&mdash; unless most ancient custom in any respect avail the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, upon the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, the Truth, in remaining in their old usage, and forsaking the new way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And this indeed you Africans are able to say against Stephen, that when you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> you forsook the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of custom. But we join custom to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and to the Romans' custom we oppose custom, but the custom of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; holding from the beginning that which was delivered by Christ and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.  Nor do we remember that this at any time began among us, since it has always been observed here, that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> none but one <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, and accounted no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> except that of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church. Certainly, since some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> about the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of those who, although they receive the new <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,  yet appear to recognise the same Father and Son with us; very many of us meeting together in Iconium very carefully examined the matter, and we decided that every <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was altogether to be rejected which is arranged for without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. </p>

<p>20. But to what they allege and say on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that the apostle said, <q>Whether in pretence or in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Christ is preached,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052908"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse18">Philippians 1:18</a></span> it is idle for us to reply; when it is manifest that the apostle, in his epistle wherein he said this, made mention neither of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> nor of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but spoke of brethren only, whether as perfidiously speaking in agreement with himself, or as persevering in sincere <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; nor is it needful to discuss this in a long argument, but it is sufficient to read the epistle itself, and to gather from the apostle himself what the apostle said.</p>

<p>21. What then, say they, will become of those who, coming from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, have been received without the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? If they have departed this life, they are reckoned in the number of those who have been <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> indeed among us, but have died before they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>&mdash;no trifling  advantage of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to which they had attained by forsaking <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, although, being prevented by death, they had not gained the consummation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.  But they who still abide in life should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that they may obtain remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, lest by the presumption of others they remain in their old <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and die without the completion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But what a crime is theirs on the one hand who receive, or on the other, theirs who are received, that their foulness not being washed away by the layer of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, nor their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> put away, communion being rashly seized, they touch the body and blood of the Lord, although it is written, <q>Whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052911"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse27">1 Corinthians 11:27</a></span></p>

<p>22. We have judged, that those also whom they, who had formerly been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and afterwards had assumed to themselves the power of clerical ordination, had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, are to be regarded as not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. And this is observed among us, that whosoever dipped by them come to us are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among us as strangers and having obtained nothing, with the only and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and obtain the regeneration of the layer of life. And yet there is a great difference between him who unwillingly and constrained by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> has given way, and him who with a profane will boldly rebels against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or with impious voice blasphemes against the Father and God of Christ and the Creator of the whole world. And Stephen is not ashamed to assert and to say that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be granted by those who are themselves set fast in all kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as if in the house of death there could be the layer of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>23. What, then, is to be made of what is written, <q>Abstain from strange water, and drink not from a strange fountain,</q>  if, leaving the sealed fountain of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, you take up strange water for your own, and pollute the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with unhallowed fountains? For when you communicate with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, what else do you do than drink from their slough and mud; and while you yourself are purged with the Church's sanctification, you become befouled with the contact of the filth of others? And do you not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> when you are giving testimony to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, although it is written, <q>A false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> shall not be unpunished? </q>  But indeed you are worse than all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For when many, as soon as their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, come over to you from them that they may receive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, you assist the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of those who come, and, obscuring the light of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you heap up the darkness of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> night; and although they confess that they are in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and have no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and therefore come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, you take away from them remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is given in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, by saying that they are already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and have obtained the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and you do not perceive that their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will be required at your hands when the day of judgment shall come, for having denied to the thirsting the drink of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and having been the occasion of death to those that were desirious of living. And, after all this, you are indignant!</p>

<p>24. Consider with what want of judgment you dare to blame those who strive for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> against <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. For who ought more <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> to be indignant against the other?&mdash; whether he who supports God's enemies, or he who, in opposition to him who supports God's enemies, unites <em>with us</em> on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Church?&mdash; except that it is plain that the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> are also excited and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, because by the want of counsel and discourse they are easily turned to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; so that of none more than of you does <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> say, <q>A wrathful man stirs up strifes, and a <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> man heaps up <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052914"><a href="../bible/pro029.htm#verse22">Proverbs 29:22</a></span> For what strifes and dissensions have you stirred up throughout the churches of the whole world! Moreover, how great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> have you heaped up for yourself, when you cut yourself off from so many flocks! For it is yourself that you have cut off. Do not deceive yourself, since he is really the schismatic who has made himself an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> from the communion of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity.  For while you think that all may be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by you, you have <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> yourself alone from all; and not even the precepts of an apostle have been able to mould you to the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and peace, although he warned, and said, <q>I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.</q> </p>

<p>25. How carefully has Stephen fulfilled these salutary commands and warnings of the apostle, keeping in the first place lowliness of mind and meekness! For what is more lowly or meek than to have disagreed with so many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> throughout the whole world, breaking peace with each one of them in various kinds of discord:  at one time with the eastern churches, as we are sure you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; at another time with yon who are in the south, from whom he received <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as messengers sufficiently patiently and meekly not to receive them even to the speech of an ordinary conference; and even more, so mindful of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and charity as to command the entire fraternity, that no one should receive them into his house, so that not only peace and communion, but also a shelter and entertainment, were denied to them when they came! This is to have kept the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, to cut himself off from the unity of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,  and to make himself a stranger in all respects from his brethren, and to rebel against the sacrament and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of contumacious discord! With such a man can there be one Spirit and one body, in whom perchance there is not even one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so slippery, and shifting, and uncertain is it?</p>

<p>26. But as far as he is concerned, let us leave him;  let us rather deal with that concerning which there is the greatest question. They who contend that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> ought to be received as if they had obtained the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of lawful <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, say that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is one and the same to them and to us, and differs in no respect. But what says the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>? <q>One Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, one God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052920"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5-6</a></span> If the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> be one and the same with ours, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also is one; but if our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is one, assuredly also we have one Lord: if there is one Lord, it follows that we say that He is one.  But if this unity which cannot be separated and divided at all, is itself also among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, why do we contend any more? Why do we call them <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? Moreover, since we and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have not one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor one Lord, nor one Church, nor one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor even one Spirit, nor one body, it is manifest that neither can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> be common to us with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, since between us there is nothing at all in common. And yet Stephen is not ashamed to afford patronage to such in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and for the sake of maintaining <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to divide the brotherhood and in addition, to call Cyprian <q>a false Christ and a false apostle, and a deceitful worker.</q>  And he, conscious that all these characters are in himself, has been in advance of you, by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> objecting to another those things which he himself ought deservedly to hear. We all bid you, for all our sakes, with all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are in Africa, and all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and all the brotherhood, farewell; that, constantly of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and thinking the same thing, we may find you united with us even though afar off. </p>
