<h1>Epistle 75</h1>

<p><strong>To Magnus, on Baptizing the Novatians, and Those Who Obtain Grace on a Sick-Bed.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; The Former Part of This Letter is of the Same Tenor with Those that Precede, Except that He Inculcates Concerning the Novatians What He Had in Substance Said Concerning All Heretics; Moreover, Insinuating by the Way that the Legitimate Succession of Cornelius at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is Known, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> May Be Known. In the Second Part (Which Hitherto, as the Title Sufficiently Indicates, Has Been Wrongly Published as a Separate Letter) He Teaches that that is a True Baptism Wherein One is Baptized by Sprinkling on a Sick-Bed, as Well as by Immersion in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Magnus his son, greeting. With your usual religious diligence, you have consulted my poor intelligence, dearest son, as to whether, among other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, they also who come from <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> ought, after his profane washing, to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and sanctified in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, with the lawful, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and only <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Respecting which matter, as much as the capacity of my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> suggest, I answer, that no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics at all have any power or right. For which reason <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> neither ought to be nor can be expected, inasmuch as he also is without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and acting in opposition to the peace and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, from being counted among adversaries and antichrists. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, when He testified in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that those who were not with Him were His adversaries, did not point out any species of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but showed that all whatsoever who were not with Him, and who, not gathering with Him, were scattering His flock, were His adversaries; saying, <q>He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters.</q>  Moreover, the blessed Apostle John himself distinguished no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, neither did he set down any as specially separated; but he called all who had gone out from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and who acted in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, antichrists, saying, <q>You have heard that <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> comes, and even now have come many antichrists; wherefore we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052926"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:18-19</a></span> Whence it appears, that all are adversaries of the Lord and antichrists, who are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have departed from charity and from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In addition, moreover, the Lord establishes it in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and says, <q>But if he neglect to hear the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let him be unto you as a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> man and a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052927"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;18:17</a></span> Now if they who despise the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are counted <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>, much more certainly is it necessary that rebels and enemies, who forge false altars, and lawless priesthoods, and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and corrupter names, should be counted among <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>; since they who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> less, and are only despisers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are by the Lord's sentence judged to be <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>.</p>

<p>2. But that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is one, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> declares in the Song of Songs, saying, in the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>My dove, my undefiled, is one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052928"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:9</a></span> Concerning which also He says again, <q>A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring sealed up, a well of living water.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052929"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse12">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:12</a></span> But if the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is a garden enclosed; a thing that is closed up cannot lie open to strangers and profane <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. And if it is a fountain sealed, he who, being placed without has no access to the spring, can neither drink thence nor be sealed. And the well also of living water, if it is one and the same within, he who is placed without cannot be quickened and sanctified from that water of which it is only granted to those who are within to make any use, or to drink. Peter also, showing this, set forth that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is one, and that only they who are in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and said, <q>In the ark of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, few, that is, eight <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, were saved by water; the like figure where-unto even <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> shall save you; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note052930"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:20-21</a></span> proving and attesting that the one ark of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> was a type of the one Church. If, then, in that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the world thus expiated and purified, he who was not in the ark of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> could be saved by water, he who is not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to which alone <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is granted, can also now be quickened by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Moreover, too, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, more openly and clearly still manifesting this same thing, writes to the Ephesians, and says, <q>Christ loved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water.</q>  But if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is one which is loved by Christ, and is alone cleansed by His washing, how can he who is not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be either loved by Christ, or washed and cleansed by His washing?</p>

<p>3. Wherefore, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone has the living water, and the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> and cleansing man, he who says that any one can be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and sanctified by <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> must first show and teach that <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or presides over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is one, and as she is one, cannot be both within and without. For if she is with <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, she was not with Cornelius.  But if she was with Cornelius, who succeeded the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Fabian by lawful ordination, and whom, beside the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the Lord <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> also with <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; nor can he be reckoned as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who, succeeding to no one, and despising the evangelical and apostolic tradition, sprang from himself. For he who has not been ordained in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can neither have nor hold to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in any way.</p>

<p>4. For the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the sacred Scripture sets forth that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not without, nor can be separated nor divided against itself, but maintains the unity of an inseparable and undivided house; since it is written of the sacrament of the passover, and of the lamb, which Lamb designated Christ: <q>In one house shall it be eaten: you shall not carry forth the flesh abroad out of the house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052933"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse46">Exodus 12:46</a></span> Which also we see expressed concerning Rahab, who herself also bore a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who received the command which said, <q>You shall bring your father, and your mother, and your brethren, and all your father's household unto you into your house; and whosoever shall go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052934"><a href="../bible/jos002.htm#verse18">Joshua 2:18-19</a></span> In which <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is declared, that they who will live, and escape from the destruction of the world, must be gathered together into one house alone, that is, into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but whosoever of those thus collected together shall go out abroad, that is, if any one, although he may have obtained <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, shall depart and go out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that his blood shall be upon him; that is, that he himself must charge it upon himself that he perishes; which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> explains, teaching and enjoining that a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> must be avoided, as perverse, and a sinner, and as condemned of himself. For that man will be guilty of his own ruin, who, not being cast out by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but of his own accord deserting from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> presumption condemned of himself.</p>

<p>5. And therefore the Lord, suggesting to us a unity that comes from divine authority, lays it down, saying, <q>I and my Father are one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052935"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John 10:30</a></span> To which unity reducing His Church, He says again, <q>And there shall be one <em>flock</em>,  and one shepherd.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052937"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse16">John 10:16</a></span> But if the flock is one, how can he be numbered among the flock who is not in the number of the flock? Or how can he be esteemed a pastor, who&mdash;while the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> shepherd remains and presides over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> by successive ordination&mdash;succeeding to no one, and beginning from himself, becomes a stranger and a profane person, an enemy of the Lord's peace and of the divine unity, not dwelling in the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, in which none dwell except they are of one heart and one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> speaks in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, and says, <q>It is God who makes men to dwell of one mind in a house.</q> </p>

<p>6. Besides even the Lord's <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> themselves declare that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> unanimity is linked together with itself by a firm and inseparable charity, For when the Lord calls bread, which is combined by the union of many grains, His body, He indicates our people whom He bore as being united; and when He calls the wine, which is pressed from many grapes and clusters and collected together, His blood, He also signifies our flock linked together by the mingling of a united multitude.  If <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> is united to this bread of the Lord, if he also is mingled with this cup of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he may also seem to be able to have the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if it be manifest that he holds the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In fine, how inseparable is the sacrament of unity, and how hopeless are they, and what excessive ruin they earn for themselves from the indignation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who make a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and, forsaking their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>,  appoint another false <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for themselves without&mdash;<a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> declares in the books of Kings; where ten tribes were divided from the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a> and Benjamin, and, forsaking their king, appointed for themselves another one without. It says, <q>And the Lord was very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with all the seed of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and removed them away, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until He had cast them out of His sight; for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was scattered from the house of David, and they made themselves a king, <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> the son of Nebat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052941"><a href="../bible/2ki017.htm#verse20">2 Kings 17:20-21</a></span> It says that the Lord was very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and gave them up to perdition, because they were scattered from unity, and had made another king for themselves. And so great was the indignation of the Lord against those who had made the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, that even when the man of God was sent to <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, to charge upon him his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and predict the future vengeance, he was forbidden to eat bread or to drink water with them. And when he did not observe this, and took meat against the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he was immediately smitten by the majesty of the divine judgment, so that returning thence he was slain on the way by the jaws of a lion which attacked him. And dares any one to say that the saving water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can be in common with schismatics, with whom neither earthly food nor worldly drink ought to be in common? Moreover, the Lord satisfies us in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and shows forth a still greater light of intelligence, that the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had then divided themselves from the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a> and Benjamin, and forsaking Jerusalem had seceded to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, should be reckon among profane <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For when first He sent His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> on the ministry of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, He bade them, saying, <q>Go not into the way of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and into any city of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> enter not.</q>  Sending first to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, He commands the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> as yet to be passed over; but by adding that even the city of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> was to be omitted, where there were schismatics, He shows that schismatics were to be put on the same level as <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<p>7. But if any one objects, by way of saying that <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> holds the same law which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> holds, baptizes with the same <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> with which we <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the same God and Father, the same Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and that for this reason he may claim the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, namely, that he seems not to differ from us in the baptismal interrogatory; let any one that thinks that this may be objected, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> first of all, that them is not one law of the Creed, nor the same interrogatory common to us and to schismatics. For when they say, <q>Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> through the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church? </q>they lie in their interrogatory, since they have not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Then, besides, with their own voice they themselves confess that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> cannot be given except by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church; and not having this, they show that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> cannot be remitted among them.</p>

<p>8. But that they are said to have the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father as we, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the same Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, can be of no avail to such as these. For even Korah, Dathan, and Abiram <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the same God as did the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Living under the same law and religion, they invoke the one and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was to be invoked and worshipped; yet, because they transgressed the ministry of their office in opposition to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who bad received the legitimate <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> by the condescension of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the ordination of the Lord, and claimed to themselves the power of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a>, divinely stricken, they immediately suffered punishment for their unlawful endeavours; and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered irreligiously and lawlessly, contrary to the right of divine appointment, could not be accepted, nor profit them. Even those very censers in which <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> had been lawlessly offered, lest they should any more be used by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but that they might rather exhibit a memorial of the divine vengeance and indignation for the correction of their successors, being by the command of the Lord melted and purged by fire, were beaten out into flexible plates, and fastened to the altars, according to what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> says, <q>to be,</q> it says, <q>a memorial to the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that no stranger which is not of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> come near to offer <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> before the Lord, that he be not as Korah.</q>  And yet those men had not made a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, nor had gone out abroad, and in opposition to God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> rebelled shamelessly and with hostility; but this these men are now doing who divide the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and, as rebels against the peace and unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, attempt to establish a throne for themselves, and to assume the primacy,  and to claim the right of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> and of offering. How can they complete what they do, or obtain anything by lawless endeavours from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing that they are endeavouring against God what is not lawful to them? Wherefore they who patronize <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> or other schismatics of that kind, contend in vain that any one can be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and sanctified with a saving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> among them, when it is plain that he who baptizes has not the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>.</p>

<p>9. And, moreover, that it may be better understood what is the divine judgment against audacity of the like kind, we find that in such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, not only the leaders and originators, but also the partakers, are destined to punishment, unless they have separated themselves from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; as the Lord by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commands, and says, <q>Separate yourselves from the tents of these most hardened men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052945"><a href="../bible/num016.htm#verse26">Numbers 16:26</a></span> And what the Lord had threatened by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> He fulfilled, that whosoever had not separated himself from Korah, and Dathan, and Abiram, immediately suffered punishment for his impious communion. By which example is shown and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, that all will be liable to guilt as well as its punishment, who with irreligious boldness mingle themselves with schismatics in opposition to prelates and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; even as also by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Osea the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> witnesses, and says, Their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> shall be unto them as the bread of mourning; all that thereof shall be polluted;  <span class="stiki" id="note052946"><a href="../bible/hos009.htm#verse4">Hosea 9:4</a></span> teaching, doubtless, and showing that all are absolutely joined with the leaders in punishment, who have been contaminated by their crime.</p>

<p>10. What, then, can be their deservings in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on whom punishment are divinely denounced? Or how can such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> justify and sanctify the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, who, being enemies of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, strive to usurp things foreign and lawless, and by no right conceded to them? And yet we do not wonder that, in accordance with their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, they do contend for them. For it is necessary that each one of them should maintain what they do; nor when vanquished will they easily yield, although they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that what they do is not lawful. That is to be wondered at, yea, rather to be indignant and aggrieved at, that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should support antichrists; and that prevaricators of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and betrayers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, should stand within in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself.  And these, although otherwise obstinate and unteachable, yet still at least confess this that all, whether <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics, are without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and therefore can indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, but cannot confer the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and at this very point they are held fast by us, inasmuch as we show that those who have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are not able to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> at all.</p>

<p>11. For since in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> every one has his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> remitted, the Lord proves and declares in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can only be put away by those who have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, sending forth His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, He speaks to them, and says, <q>As the Father has sent me, even so send I you. And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you remit, they shall be remitted unto them; and whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you retain, they shall be retained.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052948"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse21">John 20:21-23</a></span> In which place He shows, that he alone can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and give remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> who has the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Moreover, John, who was to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> Christ our Lord Himself, previously received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> while he was yet in his mother's womb, that it might be certain and manifest that none can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> save those who have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Therefore those who patronize <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics must answer us whether they have or have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. If they have, why are hands imposed on those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among them when they come to us, that they may receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, since He must surely have been received there, where if He was He could be given? But if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and therefore hands are imposed on them among us, that <em>here</em> may be received what <em>there</em> neither is nor can be given; it is plain, also, that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> cannot be given by those who, it is certain, have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And therefore, in order that, according to the divine arrangement and the evangelical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they may be able to obtain remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to be sanctified, and to become temples of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they must all absolutely be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who come from adversaries and antichrists to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>12. You have asked also, dearest son, what I thought of those who obtain God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in sickness and weakness, whether they are to be accounted legitimate <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, for that they are not to be washed, but sprinkled, with the saving water. In this point, my diffidence and modesty prejudges none, so as to prevent any from feeling what he thinks right, and from doing what he feels to be right.  As far as my poor understanding conceives it, I think that the divine benefits can in no respect be mutilated and weakened; nor can anything less occur in that case, where, with full and entire <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> both of the giver and receiver, is accepted what is drawn from the divine gifts. For in the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> the contagion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is not in such wise washed away, as the filth of the skin and of the body is washed away in the carnal and ordinary washing, as that there should be need of saltpetre and other appliances also, and a bath and a basin wherewith this vile body must be washed and purified. Otherwise is the breast of the believer washed; otherwise is the mind of man purified by the merit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, when necessity compels, and God bestows His mercy, the divine methods confer the whole benefit on <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>; nor ought it to trouble any one that sick people seem to be sprinkled or affused, when they obtain the Lord's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, when <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> speaks by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ezekiel, and says, <q>Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness and from all your <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> will I cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052950"><a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse25">Ezekiel 36:25-26</a></span> Also in Numbers: <q>And the man that shall be unclean until the evening shall be purified on the third day, and on the seventh day shall be clean: but if he shall not be purified on the third day, on the seventh day he shall not be clean. And that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be cut off from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: because the water of sprinkling has not been sprinkled upon him.</q>  And again: <q>And the Lord spoke unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> saying, Take the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> from among the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and cleanse them. And thus shall you do unto them, to cleanse them: you shall sprinkle them with the water of purification.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052952"><a href="../bible/num008.htm#verse5">Numbers 8:5-7</a></span> And again: <q>The water of sprinkling is a purification.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052953"><a href="../bible/num019.htm#verse9">Numbers 19:9</a></span> Whence it appears that the sprinkling also of water prevails equally with the washing of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and that when this is done in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> both of receiver and giver is sound, all things hold and may be consummated and perfected by the majesty of the Lord and by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>13. But, moreover, in respect of some calling those who have obtained the peace of Christ by the saving water and by legitimate <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but Clinics, I do not find whence they take up this name, unless perhaps, having read more, and of a more recondite kind, they have taken these Clinics from Hippocrates or Soranus.  For I, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of a Clinic in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that to that paralytic and infirm man, who lay on his bed during the long course of his life, his infirmity presented no obstacle to his attainment in the fullest degree of heavenly strength. Nor was he only raised from his bed by the divine indulgence, but he also took up his bed itself with his restored and increased strength. And therefore, as far as it is allowed me by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to conceive and to think, this is my opinion, that any one should be esteemed a legitimate <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, who by the law and right of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall have obtained the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Or if any one think that those have gained nothing by having only been sprinkled with the saving water, but that they are still empty and void, let them not be deceived, so as if they escape the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of their sickness, and get well, they <em>should seek</em> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.  But if they cannot be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> who have already been sanctified by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, why are they offended in respect of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the mercy of the Lord? Or have they obtained indeed the divine favour, but in a shorter and more limited measure of the divine gift and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, so as indeed to be esteemed <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but yet not to be counted equal with others?</p>

<p>14. Nay, verily, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not given by measure, but is poured out altogether on the believer. For if the day rises alike to all, and if the sun is diffused with like and equal light over all, how much more does Christ, who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sun and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> day, bestow in His Church the light of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life with the like equality! Of which equality we see the sacrament celebrated in Exodus, when the manna flowed down from heaven, and, prefiguring the things to come, showed forth the nourishment of the heavenly bread and the food of the coming Christ. For there, without distinction either of sex or of age, an omer was collected equally by each one.  Whence it appeared that the mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that would subsequently follow, was equally divided among all; without difference of sex, without distinction of years, without accepting of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, upon all the people of God the gift of spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was shed. Assuredly the same spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is equally received in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, is subsequently either increased or diminished in our conversation and conduct; as in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the Lord's seed is equally sown, but, according to the variety of the soil, some is wasted, and some is increased into a large variety of plenty, with an exuberant fruit of either thirty or sixty or a hundred fold. But, once more, when each was called to receive a penny, wherefore should what is distributed equally by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be diminished by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> interpretation?</p>

<p>15. But if any one is moved by this, that some of those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in sickness are still tempted by unclean spirits, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the obstinate <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> prevails even up to the saving water, but that in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> it loses all the poison of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. An instance of this we see in the king <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, who, having struggled long, and delayed in his perfidy, could resist and prevail until he came to the water; but when he had come there, he was both conquered and destroyed. And that that sea was a sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> declares, saying, <q>Brethren, I would not have you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and were all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the cloud and in the sea; </q>and he added, saying, <q>Now all these things were our examples.</q>  And this also is done in the present day, in that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is scourged, and burned, and tortured by exorcists, by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> voice, and by divine power;  and although he often says. that he is going out, and will leave the men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet in that which he says he deceives, and puts in practice what was before done by <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> with the same obstinate and fraudulent deceit. When, however, they come to the water of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and to the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, we ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and to trust that there the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is beaten down, and the man, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is set free by the divine mercy. For as scorpions and serpents, which prevail on the dry ground, when cast into water, cannot prevail nor retain their venom; so also the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits, which are called scorpions and serpents, and yet are trodden under foot by us, by the power given by the Lord, cannot remain any longer in the body of a man in whom, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and sanctified, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is beginning to dwell.</p>

<p>16. This, finally, in very fact also we experience, that those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by urgent necessity in sickness, and obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, are free from the unclean spirit wherewith they were previously moved, and live in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in praise and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and day by day make more and more advance in the increase of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by the growth of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And, on the other hand, some of those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in health, if subsequently they begin to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are shaken by the return of the unclean spirit, so that it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is driven out in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the believer, and returns if the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> afterwards shall fail. Unless, indeed, it seems just to some, that they who, outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among adversaries and antichrists, are polluted with profane water, should be judged to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; while they who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are thought to have attained less of divine mercy and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and so great consideration be had for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that they who come from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> are not interrogated whether they are washed or sprinkled, whether they be clinics or peripatetics; but among us the sound <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is disparaged, and in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> its majesty and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> suffer derogation. </p>

<p>17. I have replied, dearest son, to your letter, so far as my poor ability prevailed; and I have shown, as far as I could, what I think; prescribing to no one, so as to prevent any prelate from determining what he thinks right, as he shall give an account of his own doings to the Lord, according to what the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> in his Epistle to the Romans writes and says: <q>Every one of us shall give account for himself: let us not therefore judge one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052960"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse12">Romans 14:12-13</a></span> I bid you, dearest son, ever heartily farewell.</p>
