<h1>Epistle 76</h1>

<p><strong>Cyprian to Nemesianus and Other Martyrs in the Mines.</strong> </p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; He Extols with Wonderful Commendations the Martyrs in the Mines, Opposing, in a Beautiful Antithesis, to the Tortures of Each, the Consolations of Each.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Nemesianus, Felix, Lucius, another Felix, Litteus, Polianus, Victor, Jader, and Dativus, his fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, also to his fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and the rest of the brethren in the mines, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty, and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, and of God our preserver, everlasting greeting. Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, indeed, would demand, most blessed and beloved brethren, that I myself should come to see and to embrace you, if the limits of the place appointed me did not restrain me, banished as I am for the sake of the confession of the Name. But in what way I can, I bring myself into your presence; and even though it is not permitted me to come to you in body and in movement, yet in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and in spirit I come expressing my mind in my letter, in which mind I joyfully exult in those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and praises of yours, counting myself a partaker with you, although not in bodily suffering, yet in community of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Could I be silent and restrain my voice in stillness, when I am made aware of so many and such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> things concerning my dearest friends, things with which the divine condescension has honoured you, so that part of you have already gone before by the consummation of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> to receive from their Lord the crown of their deserts? Part still abide in the dungeons of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, or in the mines and in chains, exhibiting by the very delays of their punishments, greater examples for the strengthening and arming of the brethren, advancing by the tediousness of their tortures to more ample titles of merit, to receive as many payments in heavenly rewards, as days are now counted in their punishments. I do not marvel, most brave and blessed brethren, that these things have happened to you in consideration of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of your religion and your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; that the Lord should thus have lifted you to the lofty height of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of His glorification, seeing that you have always flourished in His Church, guarding the tenor of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, keeping firmly the Lord's commands; in simplicity, innocence; in charity, concord; modesty in humility, diligence in administration, watchfulness in helping those that suffer, mercy in cherishing the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, constancy in defending the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, judgment in severity of discipline. And that nothing should be wanting to the example of good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in you, even now, in the confession of your voice and the suffering of your body, you provoke the minds of your brethren to divine <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, by exhibiting yourselves as leaders of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that while the flock follows its pastors, and imitates what it sees to be done by those set over it, it may be crowned with the like merits of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> by the Lord.</p>

<p>2. But that, being first severely beaten with clubs, and ill-used, you have begun by sufferings of that kind, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> firstlings of your confession, is not a matter to be execrated by us. For a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> body is not very greatly terrified at clubs, seeing all its hope is in the Wood.  The servant of Christ acknowledges the sacrament of his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: redeemed by wood to life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, he is advanced by wood to the crown. But what wonder if, as golden and silver vessels, you have been committed to the mine that is the home of gold and silver, except that now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the mines is changed, and the places which previously had been accustomed to yield gold and silver have begun to receive them? Moreover, they have put fetters on your feet, and have bound your blessed limbs, and the temples of God with disgraceful chains, as if the spirit also could be bound with the body, or your gold could be stained by the contact of iron. To men who are dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and attesting their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with religious <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, such things are ornaments, not chains; nor do they bind the feet of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, but glorify them for a crown. Oh feet blessedly bound, which are loosed, not by the smith but by the Lord! Oh feet blessedly bound, which are guided to paradise in the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>! Oh feet bound for the present time in the world, that they may be always free with the Lord! Oh feet, lingering for a while among the fetters and cross-bars,  but to run quickly to Christ on a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> road! Let cruelty, either <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> or malignant, hold you here in its bonds and chains as long as it will, from this earth and from these sufferings you shall speedily come to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. The body is not cherished in the mines with couch and cushions, but it is cherished with the refreshment and solace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The frame wearied with labours lies prostrate on the ground, but it is no penalty to lie down with Christ. Your limbs unbathed, are foul and disfigured with filth and dirt; but within they are spiritually cleansed, although without the flesh is defiled. There the bread is scarce; but man lives not by bread alone, but by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Shivering, you want clothing; but he who puts on Christ is both abundantly clothed and adorned. The hair of your half-shorn bead  seems repulsive; but since Christ is the head of the man, anything whatever must needs become that head which is illustrious on account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name. All that deformity, detestable and foul to <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, with what splendour shall it be recompensed! This temporal and brief suffering, how shall it be exchanged for the re ward of a bright and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, when, according to the word of the blessed apostle, <q>the Lord shall change the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like to the body of His brightness!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052966"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;3:21</a></span> </p>

<p>3. But there cannot be felt any loss of either religion or <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, most beloved brethren, in the fact that now there is given no opportunity there to God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for offering and celebrating the divine <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; yea, you celebrate and offer a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to God equally  precious and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and that will greatly profit you for the retribution of heavenly rewards, since the sacred Scripture speaks, saying, <q>The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of God is a broken spirit; a contrite and humbled heart God does not despise.</q>  You offer this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; you celebrate this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> without intermission day and night, being made victims to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and exhibiting yourselves as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and unspotted offerings, as the apostle exhorts and says, <q>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you present your bodies a living <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, acceptable unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And be not conformed to this world; but be you transformed by the renewing of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052969"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;12:1-2</a></span> </p>

<p>4. For this it is which especially pleases <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; it is this wherein our works with greater deserts are successful in earning God's good-will; this it is which alone the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion can render to the Lord for His great and saving benefits, as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> declares and witnesses in the Psalms: <q>What shall I render,</q> says He, <q>to the Lord for all His benefits towards me? I will take the cup of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and I will call upon the name of the Lord. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q>  Who would not gladly and readily receive the cup of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? Who would not with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> desire that in which he himself also may render somewhat unto His Lord? Who would not bravely and unfalteringly receive a death precious in the sight of the Lord, to please His eyes, who, looking down from above upon us who are placed in the conflict for His name, approves the willing, assists the struggling, crowns the conquering with the recompense of patience, goodness, and affection, rewarding in us whatever He Himself has bestowed, and honouring what He has accomplished?</p>

<p>5. For that it is His doing that we conquer, and that we attain by the subduing of the adversary to the palm of the greatest contest, the Lord declares and teaches in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, saying, <q>But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall speak; for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak. For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you.</q>  And again: <q>Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what you shall answer; for I will give you a month and wisdom, which your adversaries shall not be able to resist.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052972"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse14">Luke 21:14-15</a></span> In which, indeed, is both the great confidence of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and the gravest fault of the faithless, that they do not trust Him who promises to give His help to those who confess Him, and do not on the other hand <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him who threatens <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment to those who deny Him.</p>

<p>6. All which things, most brave and faithful soldiers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you have suggested to your brethren, fulfilling in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> what you have previously taught in words, hereafter to be greatest in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, as the Lord promises and says, <q>Whosoever shall do and teach so, shall be called the greatest in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052973"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse19">Matthew 5:19</a></span> Moreover, a manifold portion of the people, following your example, have confessed alike with you, and alike have been crowned, associated with you in the bond of the strongest charity, and separated from their prelates neither by the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> nor by the mines; in the number of whom neither are there wanting <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in whom the hundred-fold are added to the fruit of sixty-fold, and whom a double <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> has advanced to the heavenly crown. In boys also a I <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> greater than their age has surpassed their years in the praise of their confession, so that every sex and every age should adorn the blessed flock of your <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. </p>

<p>7. What now must be the vigour, beloved brethren, of your victorious consciousness, what the loftiness of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, what exultation in feeling, what triumph in your breast, that every one of you stands near to the promised reward of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are secure from the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, walk in the mines with a body captive indeed, but with a heart reigning, that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ is present with you, rejoicing in the endurance of His servants, who are ascending by His footsteps and in His paths to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdoms! You daily expect with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> the saving day of your departure; and already about to withdraw from the world, you are hastening to the rewards of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and to the divine homes, to behold after this darkness of the world the purest light, and to receive a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> greater than all sufferings and conflicts, as the apostle witnesses, and says, <q>The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that shall be revealed in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052975"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans 8:18</a></span> And because now your word is more effectual in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and supplication is more quick to obtain what is sought for in afflictions, seek more eagerly, and ask that the divine condescension would consummate the confession of all of us; that from this darkness and these snares of the world God would set us also free with you, sound and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>; that we who here are united in the bond of charity and peace, and have stood together against the wrongs of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and the oppressions of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> together in the heavenly kingdom. I bid you, most blessed and most beloved brethren, ever farewell in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and always and everywhere remember me. </p>
