<h1>Epistle 77</h1>

<p><strong>The Reply of Nemesianus, Dativus, Felix, and Victor, to Cyprian.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; This Epistle and the Two Following Contain Nothing Else Than Replies to the Foregoing, Inasmuch as They Contain The Thanksgiving as Well for the Comfort Conveyed by the Letter as for the Assistance Sent Therewith. But from the Fact that Three Distinct Letters are Sent in Reply to the Single One of Cyprian's, We are to Gather that the Bishops Who Wrote Them Were Placed in Different Departments of the Mines.</em> </p>

<p>1. Nemesianus, Dativus, Felix, and Victor, to their brother Cyprian, in the Lord <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. You speak, dearly beloved Cyprian, in your letters always with deep meaning, as suits the condition of the time, by the assiduous reading of which letters both the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are corrected and men of good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are confirmed. For while you do not cease in your writings to lay bare the hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, you thus make us to grow in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and men from the world to draw near to belief. For by whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things you have introduced in your many books, unconsciously you have described yourself to us. For you are greater than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in discourse, in speech more eloquent, in counsel wiser, in patience more simple, in works more abundant, in abstinence more <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> more <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and in good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> more innocent. And you yourself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, beloved, that our eager wish was, that we might see you, our teacher and our lover, attain to the crown of a great confession.</p>

<p>2. For, in the proceedings before the proconsul; as a good and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> teacher you first have pronounced that which we your <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, following you, ought to say before the president. And, as a sounding trumpet, you have stirred up God's soldiers, furnished with heavenly arms, to the close encounter; and fighting in the first rank, you have slain the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> with a spiritual sword: you have also ordered the troops of the brethren, on the one hand and on the other, with your words, so that snares were on all sides laid for the enemy, and the severed sinews of the very carcass of the public foe were trodden under foot.  Believe us, dearest, that your innocent spirit is not far from the hundred-fold reward, seeing that it has feared neither the first onsets of the world, nor shrunk from going into exile, nor hesitated to leave the city, nor dreaded to dwell in a desert place; and since it furnished many with an example of confession, itself first spoke the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>-<a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. For it provoked others to acts of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> by its own example; and not only began to be a companion of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> already departing from the world, but also linked a heavenly friendship with those who should be so.</p>

<p>3. Therefore they who were condemned with us give you before God the greatest thanks, beloved Cyprian, that in your letter you have refreshed their suffering breasts; have healed their limbs wounded with clubs; have loosened their feet bound with fetters; have smoothed the hair of their half-shorn head; have illuminated the darkness of the dungeon; have brought down the mountains of the mine to a smooth surface; have even placed fragrant flowers to their nostrils, and have shut out the foul odour of the smoke.  Moreover, your continued gifts, and those of our beloved Quirinus, which you sent to be distributed by Herennianus the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacon</a>, and Lucian, and Maximus, and Amantius the acolytes, provided a supply of whatever had been wanting for the necessities of their bodies. Let us, then, be in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> helpers of one another: and let us ask, as you have bidden us, that we may have God and Christ and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as supporters in all our actions. We bid you, lord and brother, ever heartily farewell, and have us in mind. Greet all who are with you. All ours who are with us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, and greet you, and desire to see you.</p>
