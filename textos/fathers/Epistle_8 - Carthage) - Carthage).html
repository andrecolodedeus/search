<h1>Epistle 8</h1>

<p><strong>To the Martyrs and Confessors.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; Cyprian, Commending the African Martyrs Marvellously for Their Constancy, Urges Them to Perseverance by the Example of Their Colleague Mappalicus.</em></p>

<p>Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and confessors in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our Lord and in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, everlasting <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. I gladly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and am thankful, most brave and blessed brethren, at hearing of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, wherein the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, our Mother, glories. Lately, indeed, she gloried, when, in consequence of an enduring confession, that punishment was undergone which drove the confessors of Christ into exile; yet the present confession is so much the more illustrious and greater in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as it is braver in suffering. The combat has increased, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the combatants has increased also. Nor were you kept back from the struggle by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of tortures, but by the very tortures themselves you were more and more stimulated to the conflict; bravely and firmly you have returned with ready devotion, to contend in the extremest contest. Of you I find that some are already crowned, while some are even now within reach of the crown of victory; but all whom the danger has shut up in a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> company are animated to carry on the struggle with an equal and common warmth of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as it behooves the soldiers of Christ in the divine camp: that no allurements may deceive the incorruptible steadfastness of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, no threats terrify you, no sufferings or tortures overcome you, because <q>greater is He that is in us, than he that is in the world; </q>  nor is the earthly punishment able to do more towards casting down, than is the divine protection towards lifting up. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> struggle of the brethren, who, having become leaders to the rest in overcoming their tortures, afforded an example of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, contending in the strife, until the strife yielded, being overcome. With what praises can I commend you, most courageous brethren? With what vocal proclamation can I extol the strength of your heart and the perseverance of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? You have borne the sharpest examination by torture, even unto the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> consummation, and have not yielded to sufferings, but rather the sufferings have given way to you. The end of torments, which the tortures themselves did not give, the crown has given. The examination by torture waxing severer, continued for a long time to this result, not to overthrow the steadfast <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but to send the men of God more quickly to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. The multitude of those who were present saw with admiration the heavenly contest,&mdash; the contest of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the spiritual contest, the battle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash;saw that His servants stood with free voice, with unyielding <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, with divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>&mdash; bare, indeed, of weapons of this world, but believing and armed with the weapons of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The tortured stood more brave than the torturers; and the limbs, beaten and torn as they were, overcame the hooks that bent and tore them. The scourge, often repeated with all its rage, could not conquer invincible <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even although the membrane which enclosed the entrails were broken, and it was no longer the limbs but the wounds of the servants of God that were tortured. Blood was flowing which might quench the blaze of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, which might subdue the flames of Gehenna with its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> gore.  Oh, what a spectacle was that to the Lord,&mdash; how sublime, how great, how acceptable to the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the allegiance and devotion of His soldiers! As it is written in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> at once speaks to us and warns us: <q>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q>  Precious is the death which has bought <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> at the cost of its blood, which has received the crown from the consummation of its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. How did Christ <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> therein! How willingly did He both fight and conquer in such servants of His, as the protector of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and giving to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> as much as he who takes believes that he receives! He was present at His own contest; He lifted up, strengthened, animated the champions and assertors of His name. And He who once conquered death on our behalf, always conquers it in us. <q>When they,</q> says He, <q>deliver you up, take no thought what you shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what you shall speak. For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052158"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;10:19-20</a></span> The present struggle has afforded a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this saying. A voice filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> broke forth from the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> mouth when the most blessed Mappalicus said to the proconsul in the midst of his torments, <q>You shall see a contest tomorrow.</q> And that which he said with the testimony of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the Lord fulfilled. A heavenly contest was exhibited, and the servant of God was crowned ill the struggle of the promised fight. This is the contest which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah of old predicted, saying, <q>It shall be no light contest for you with men, since God appoints the struggle.</q>  And in order to show what this struggle would be, he added the words, <q>Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive and bear a son, and you shall call His name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052160"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> This is the struggle of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in which we engage, in which we conquer, in which we are crowned. This is the struggle which the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> has shown to us, in which it behooves us to run and to attain the crown of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> says he, <q>that they which run in a race, run all indeed, but one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain.</q> <q>Now they do it that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052161"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:24-25</a></span> Moreover, setting forth his own struggle, and declaring that he himself should soon be a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for the Lord's sake, he says, <q>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my assumption is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> His appearing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052162"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:6-8</a></span> This fight, therefore, predicted of old by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, begun by the Lord, waged by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, Mappalicus promised again to the proconsul in his own name and that of his colleagues. Nor did the faithful voice deceive in his promise; he exhibited the fight to which he had pledged himself, and he received the reward which he deserved. I not only beseech but exhort the rest of you, that you all should follow that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> now most blessed, and the other partners of that engagement&mdash;soldiers and comrades, steadfast in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, patient in suffering, victors in tortures&mdash;that those who are united at once by the bond of confession, and the entertainment of a dungeon, may also be united in the consummation of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and a celestial crown; that you by your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> may dry the tears of our Mother, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who mourns over the wreck and death of very many; and that you may confirm, by the provocation of your example, the steadfastness of others who stand also. If the battle shall call you out, if the day of your contest shall come engage bravely, fight with constancy, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you are fighting under the eyes of a present Lord, that you are attaining by the confession of His name to His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; who is not such a one as that He only looks on His servants, but He Himself also wrestles in us, Himself is engaged&mdash;Himself also in the struggles of our conflict not only crowns, but is crowned. But if before the day of your contest, of the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, peace shall supervene, let there still remain to you the sound will and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.  Nor let any one of you be saddened as if he were inferior to those who before you have suffered tortures, have overcome the world and trodden it under foot, and so have come to the Lord by a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> road. For the Lord is the <q>searcher out of the reins and the hearts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052164"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse23">Revelation 2:23</a></span> He looks through secret things, and beholds that which is concealed. In order to merit the crown from Him, His own testimony alone is sufficient, who will judge us. Therefore, beloved brethren, either case is equally lofty and illustrious&mdash;the former more secure, to wit, to hasten to the Lord with the consummation of our victory&mdash;the latter more joyous; a leave of absence, after <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, being received to flourish in the praises of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. O blessed Church of ours, which the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the divine condescension illuminates, Which in our own times the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> blood of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> renders illustrious! She was white before in the works of the brethren; now she has become purple in the blood of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Among her flowers are wanting neither roses nor lilies. Now let each one strive for the largest dignity of either <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Let them receive crowns, either white, as of labours, or of purple, as of suffering. In the heavenly camp both peace and strife have their own flowers, with which the soldier of Christ may be crowned for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. I bid you, most brave and beloved brethren, always heartily farewell in the Lord; and have me in remembrance. Fare well.</p>
